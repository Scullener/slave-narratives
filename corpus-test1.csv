Arron,Reader here is the picture of the poor way faring degraded Aaron THE LIGHT AND THE TRUTH OF SLAVERY AARON'S HISTORY Reader here is the picture of the poor way faring degraded Aaron There is clear evidence in the life and history of Aaron that he has been a slave Aaron cannot read a word There are very few full blooded blacks at the South that can read a word Aaron says Now reader Aaron wants you to buy this book I don't want you to buy it merely to read it through I want you to buy it and I want you to read it not for to lay it up in your head but to lay it up in your heart and then you will remember the poor way faring Bondman The two thirds of this little book was made up by the poor way faring degraded Aaron The Bible says faith without works is a dead article Aaron has a great knowledge of the Bible but cannot read a word Page One mouth and one back to two hands is the law That the hand of his Maker has stamped upon man But slavery lays on God's image her paw And fixes him out on a different plan Two mouths and two backs to two hands she creates And the consequence is as she might have expected Let the hands do the best upon all her estates The mouths go half fed and the backs half protected Whose eyes stand out with fatness having more than heart could wish who will turn a deaf ear to their own flesh when it passes along and do walk like Priests and Levites clear and no relief provide God in his anger down on you looks A dreadful damning sin The men that go to Congress are men of good talents and principles yet all the horrors and butcheries of slavery they sanction Aaron thinks they are as destitute of moral principles as a horse Now God Almighty has spared us to see almost another new year through a great deal of sorrow and tribulation but yet he has spared our unworthy bodies so far and has not sunk us as Mr Miller has prophesied but we ought not to make our boast about it for it may not be too late yet because we do not know when the Lord will break out in judgment against us when we are living in so much sin and iniquity when dangers stand thick through all the land to push us to the tomb and we would go to the tomb if it was not for a merciful God He is slow to anger and abundant in mercy he commands us to touch not and handle not unclean things but come out from among the wicked and dwell among the righteous Do we do this but Aaron thinks not In our free and independent country where God's holy word is scattered throughout the United States there is almost three million slaves and about one million of them the white brethren's sons and daughters Well now you all unite together and uphold the mother of abomination Now men who call yourselves christians be wise and consistent and do not go to the polls and vote for a man that will turn you right out of doors Now when you white friends was running Mr Harrison for President they made such a fuss that Aaron thought Mr Harrison was going to make milk and honey flow through the face of the earth which when he took his seat he did not live but a short time God Almighty thundered from the eternal heavens and sent for him and Aaron trusts he has gone right home to heaven and Aaron prays God that he may keep him low in the valley of humility that at the end of the warfare I may have grace to leap right home to heaven and I trust to hail Mr Harrison there When Tyler came upon the throne what did he do but turn Page men right out of office who had half a dozen little children crying for bread Now what more can you expect from a slave holding man for you can expect nothing more and if you men would be consistent with your prayers and pray from the centre of your heart then God would hear and answer and bless your prayers and let the oppressed go free but you see you don't pray in faith believing that is the reason that you cannot see to vote for good honorable men Their heads is full of the knowledge of the Almighty and their hearts is shut up with sin and iniquity Aaron's views on slavery connected with politics When Aaron struck in New Jersey it began to grow dark about two miles before I come to Elizabethtown it was very cold I traveled through a swamp about one quarter of a mile When I got into Elizabethtown I was covered with mud up to my knees and almost froze I fell into several houses and asked them if they would be good enough to let me warm me but none of them would be good enough I almost sunk in despair and I thought I would freeze I fell into a house where there was an old gentleman and I asked him if he would be good enough to let me come and warm myself he told me yes he would my heart leaped for joy because I was almost chilled through Aaron says he had two daughters and they were very fine women and one of them had lived in Missouri for four years her husband died and she became a widow It was a very cold windy night and I asked him if he would be good enough to let me lay down in the kitchen all night by the fire No you shant lay in the house he said but you may go and lay in the barn And his daughter that had become a widow in Missouri she kept house for her father she gave Aaron a first rate of a supper and a pair of dry trowsers to put on and a good pair of dry socks to put on and two good blankets and a quilt and she slipped them to me out of the kitchen window she told me in the morning when I got up to fetch them down out of the hay loft and put them in the carriage I did so I came to the kitchen and she refreshed me with a first rate of a breakfast and I had long talk with her she told me after her husband died she went about twelve miles out of the city of St Louis and kept school for a planter that owned one hundred and six slaves She told me that he cut up with his female slaves more than he did with his wife she said sometimes his poor wife was almost crazy and he tried to cut up the same capers with me but he missed of it and he pretended to be a member of the church too She told me that when the sinful capers was found out by every one of the free States she thought then slavery would be abolished and not before She told me she came home to her father's house as quick as she could get away What a blessed thing it is for any one when they meet with sorrow and afflictions to have a father's home to go to Page Now the poor slave when he is tied to the whipping post and whipped almost to death he has no father to protect him and no mother to protect him and no one to fly to but his Heavenly Father They have to bear patiently with their hard task masters and live humble and faithful to God and then at the end of the warfare God will richly crown them in heaven When I was travelling in Foxboro I fell in among Universalists and they entertained the way faring and degraded Aaron very hospitably and treated me like a brother minister and all They wrote considerable for Aaron towards printing in my book and throwed in and helped me to some money towards getting it printed I staid seven days with them And I bid 'em good bye and wished the blessing of God upon 'em Aaron says he wonders there arn't a thousand Universalists to where there is one He wonders there arn't a thousand infidels in the world to where there is one because the white brethren believe in the true light and gospel and sentiments of the Holy Ghost and yet set a bad example for their white brethren to stumble over That is what makes me say it is a wonder there is not a thousand infidels and Universalists to where there is one Men again who live up to the moral law wont enslave their brethren Aaron says that no true hearted Christian will begin to hold his brother in bonds The bible says he that stealeth a man and selleth him shall surely be put to death If he is found in his hands that thief shall die If a man hateth his brother whom he has already seen how can he love God whom he has not seen God says in the eyes of man there is respect to persons but in his eyes there is no respect to persons Whenever a man is cleansed from his sin and iniquity he is a new formed creature in Christ Jesus Christ is in that white friend the hope of glory and he is in Christ and so therefore there is no respect to persons He will treat an African brother as well as a white brother He will not oppress him If he is a wolf clothed in sheep's clothing he will stand up and say it is right to enslave the African brother But if he is a sincere godly man he will not stand up and say it is right When Aaron was in the middle of the town in Wrentham I fell among several anti slavery families and they treated me very coldly much as ever I could do to get a place to sleep but the Lord opened the heart of a white brother who had not been living in the place more than six months who gave me a first rate bed to sleep in and first rate food to eat The next morning was a very pleasant one and I told him if I never saw him no more that I might have grace to meet him in heaven and bid him and his family good by I fell in with a young minister His wife was a short woman of dark hair and she made out to write Aaron part of a chapter His wife entertained Aaron very hospitably she asked me if I would not have something to eat and I thanked Page her and told her no but I told her I would take a bite along with me and say she very well and so she gave me two or three crusts of bread and a couple of slices of mouldy meat which smelt And the minister was a very holy man and he chastised Aaron a couple of times about speaking the Lord's name in vain but Aaron is afraid he is a wolf clothed in sheep's clothing With all his holiness the crust of bread and couple slices of mouldy meat was good enough for me I trust that he may get to heaven and I may be shut out but he has got to shake off some of the sin connected with his holiness before he will see his father's face in heaven Beggars ought not to be choosers but Aaron did not go in there begging for victuals to eat I went there begging them to write a little for me being as I could not write a word myself and it is there they did write a little for me Being as his wife asked me to eat some I thought she might give me food good to eat not give me food no better than for a hog to eat and as poor and in poverty as I am I never would ask them to eat unless I gave them as good food as I eat We all ought to learn to be consistent with our holy grace for Aaron firmly believes that God is a Being that will not be mocked he is long suffering and abundant in mercy and he that endures unto the end he richly will crown in heaven but the hypocrite he will turn a deaf ear to and shut them out of his holy presence Aaron thinks if he ever gets to heaven he will hail a great many Universalists there them that believe in the true light and gospel of God's holy word I am afraid a great many of them will have to take a leap in the dark Twelve miles before Aaron struck into Uxbridge I fell in with a Universalist Aaron did not learn his name he treated me as a brother but I never shall forget his form he did'nt and sorrowful did he promise to pity and shift Aaron for money from friend to friend He helped him to lodging and to victuals and in money He told of a quaker man who was a great abolitionist he lived in Uxbridge Aaron went to him and he took my letter and read it and then told me to go about my business Aaron says it did not astonish me the Quaker brethren is like one half of the Methodist brethren they are complete wolves clothed in sheep's clothing When Aaron was in Mendon the friendly people throwed in and helped me considerable towards getting my book printed When Aaron was in Blackstone there was a white gentleman asked me if I had saw brother in law who lately removed from Connecticut State and I told him that I had saw his wife but I had not seen her husband yet he told me that he pretended to be a great anti slavery man he told me that when I saw him that he guessed he would give me twenty five cents I went to his house Sunday morning about eleven o'clock and I told him I had got victuals enough to board myself I asked him if he would'nt be clever enough to keep Aaron there all night till Monday morning Page he told me no and he would'nt do it and found as much fault with Aaron as if I had been boarding with him six months Aaron thinks instead of being an anti slavery man that he is a great rebel as ever trod the soil of New England country Aaron thinks if he had him in the South and he thought he could make one dollar on me that he would sell me as quick as lightning Aaron was a man born in the South Aaron's parents have been dead this something like twenty three years Aaron says that it was nothing but hard work and hard usage that killed them That gentleman in Millville told me there was plenty of work to be done there There were several told me there were two or three gentlemen in business there that were now broken up and there were as many as eight or nine men there told me business was very hard When a man's heart is shut up with sin and iniquity he generally always speaks what comes uppermost let it be a lie or the truth but the lie generally always comes first SLAVERY A SIN We believe slavery to be a sin always every where and only sin Sin in itself apart from the occasional rigors incidental to its administration and from all those perils liabilities and positive inflictions to which its victims are continually exposed Sin is the nature of the act which created it and in the elements which constitute it Sin because it converts persons into things men into property God's image into merchandize Because it forbids men from using themselves for the advancement of their own well being and turns them into mere instruments to be used by others solely for the benefit of the users Because it constitutes one man the owner of the body soul and spirit of other men gives him power and permission to make his own pecuniary profit the great end of their being thus striking them out of existence as beings possessing rights and susceptibilities of happiness and forcing them to exist merely as appendages to his own existence in other words because slavery holds and uses men as mere means for which to accomplish ends of which end their own interests are not a part Thus annihilating the sacred and eternal distinction between a person and a thing a distinction proclaimed an axiom of all human consciousness a distinction created by God crowned with glory and honor in the attributes intelligence morality accountability and immortality existence and commended to the homage of universal mind by the concurrent testimony of nature providence conscience and revelation by the blood of the atonement and the sanction of eternity authenticated by the seal of Deity and in its own nature effaceless and immutable This distinction slavery contemns disannuls and tramples under foot This is its fundamental element its vital constituent principle that which makes it a sin in itself under whatever modification existing all the incidental Page effects of the system flow spontaneously from its fountain head The constant exposure of the slaves to outrage and the actual inflictions which they experience in innumerable forms all result legitimately from this principle assumed in the theory and embodied in the practice of slave holding Ah me what wish can prosper or what prayer For merchants rich in cargoes of despair Who drive a loathsome traffic guage and span And buy the muscles and the bones of man Like Mary have you come early to the sepulchre seeking Jesus in the Tomb Aaron thinks that hundreds and thousands of poor creatures black and white die in that manner every year we never think to call upon our heavenly father only when afflictions fall at our heels then we'll call on our heavenly father God commands us to shoulder our cross to follow him through evil report as well as good There is a great many lives humble and faithful to God till sorrows and afflictions come against them then they will flee like deadly poisoned something like Judas and Peter they will deny that they ever knew God Let us all learn to be consistent not to deceive our brethren when we have the true love of God stamped in our unworthy hearts then we'll shoulder our cross and follow Christ through evil report as well as good Aaron has seen a good many men and women in his travels the outward appearance appeared to Aaron to be Angels when Aaron stopped with them a while and come to have dealings with them their hearts were as destitute of the love of God as a Pitcher complete wolves clothed in sheep's clothing Now reader I want you to remembeer the Bible says he that is thought much of in the eyes of men is despised in my eyes blessed is he who is despitefully used for my sake the Bible says that he who calls his brother a fool is in danger of hell fire Aaron says that a true witness of Christ is persecuted on the right hand and on the left are brought as sheep before the slaughter When Aaron was in Milford two angels entertained him very hospitable made him welcome to stay over the Sabbath with them merely stopped awhile to ask their wives to write a little and they insisted on my staying over the Sabbath day and Aaron staid with them until Monday morning I was in the house about fifteen hours they began to find as much fault with me as if I had begged them to keep me a week How wrong Aaron thinks it is when a man will stand up and tell his brother one thing and have his heart another way a hollow heart is tenfold worse than an Arab an open enemy is less to be feared than a false friend These two angels that entertained Aaron on the Sabbath day were men who professed to be filled with gospel grace but like Adna and Anthony filled with filthy lucre Page Southern Arguments to stop the Mouths of Northern Guests A Northern man goes to the South sits at a table loaded from the slaves' unpaid toil who eats his corn bread in the sun marries a slave holder and then finds out that slavery is a divine institution and defends it in Southern and Northern pulpits religious newspapers and for example consult memory or observation Rev Basil Manly a clerical man seller recently preached in your churches in various parts of New England and the scores of clerical Baptist slave holders that beset the North every Summer are invited to occupy your pulpits If you would enjoy the smiles of him who came to preach deliverance to the captives renounce all fellowship with the unfruitful works of slavery that you may in word and deed reprove them A poor slave being on his death bed begged of his master to give him his liberty before he died 'I want to die free massa ' His master replied you are going to die soon what good will your liberty do 'O master I want to die free ' He said to the slave 'you are free ' 'But do write it master I want to see it on paper ' At his earnest request he wrote that he was free the slave took it in his trembling hand looked at it with a smile and exclaimed 'O how beautiful O how beautiful ' and soon fell asleep in the arms of death If you read the election news you must have seen it of late years given under three heads thus Dem Whig Scat and if you have watched this Scat you must have seen a wonderful degree of contagion and perseverance in it it keeps growing We first notice it in the election returns of the great presidential contest of when the two great parties organized with such enthusiasm that we could hardly have expected a single scattering vote Here is a table giving the progress of this singular political heresy for three years not fully but it will serve as an illustration Scat Scat Scat Maine New Hampshire Vermont Increased by a peculiar local cause Massachusetts Connecticut New York Pennsylvania Partial Ohio Illinois Michigan Total Page And so far as elections have taken place this year the increase is still more marked Here is a leaven widely diffused and actually at work which by the rules of arithmetic will leaven the whole lump of dough by the year What means this Scat column then and what is the right and wrong of the matter It means this though the partizan editors do not like to say it there is a Liberty Party organized on the principles of ' founded on the truth that 'Honesty is the best Policy ' that Righteousness exalteth a nation a sort of Good Samaritan Party which dont pass by on the other side The members of this party find there is one question in the politics of the country which must be settled right before any other question can be settled at all and till that great question is settled right our glorious revolution is incomplete and our national history unfit to be written They find that under the form of republicanism the country is really governed by a combination of about slave holders who hold on an average ten or eleven slaves each and contrive to wield the power and patronage of the Federal Government directing it this way and that way as they think it necessary to make their property in those slaves secure and profitable Now this property in human beings is immeasurably more tyrannous and oppressive than that usurpation against which our fathers took arms in ' Therefore so far from being allowed to be the governing interest in our great republic it ought to be abolished and put a stop to by universal acclamation This should be done if it is not supported by the Constitution and much more if it is For in the latter case we need to be relieved from the double disgrace of its existence and its constitutionality Merciful heavens are we under a constitution which attempts for it cannot do it to bind us to do worse than to pick pockets and steal horses Are we born into this green world and the great brotherhood of humanity bound neck and heels to necessity of doing the meanest of all mean actions viz to help petty tyrants put the shackles of slavery on the limbs of their victims If this be so it is our plain vocation as honest men and not rebels against our Maker to rebel against this constitutional provision at once and revolutionize the government under which we are born at least so far as to make it just Do our reverend clergy say no do our learned and venerable judges say no the more need then that we should do our work instantly and like men Every ounce of moral and political not to say physical power should be exerted against a system so unjust that it cries to Heaven for vengeance and so fearfully established that it has poisoned the very fountains of gospel and law and this too notwithstanding any inferiority or degradation which may be asserted against the people suffering in slavery for the lower any man may be sunk in the scale of humanity the more need there is that he should be encourrged by justice a strict regard to his unforfeited Page rights to rise Withholding due wages and compelling labor by force will not make a bad man better any more than it will make a black man white it will not make a man more patriotic or ready to fight for his country it may incline him to fight against it and if it should then we may wake up some morning and find of our countrymen taking arms against us from the hands of our invaders Judge Upshur a slave holding Secretary of the Navy foresees this and wants to tax the free labor of the country to build and support a Navy half as large as that of Great Britain to prevent it The Liberty party is not the enemy of the slave holders exactly the reverse The establishment of justice is the true interest of every human being all history backs this assertion The instant abolition of slavery would double the wealth of the slave States even reckoned in dollars and cents The Liberty Party is not the enemy of the Constitution Construed so as to enforce the restoration of fugitives escaped from slavery and the re imposition of chains and observe it cannot be so construed without doing violence to its language the Constitution is an inconsistency a contradiction It is made to stab that very liberty which it was designed to shield It becomes a reproach a piece of hypocrisy an abomination Men will not so construe it or so obey it they hold to it and are ready to spend their treasure and their blood for it as an instrument ordained to establish justice to secure the blessing of liberty They fearlessly put it to every honest man can you commit that you know to be a most base and despisable crime to wit assist in delivering a poor hunted fugitive slave to the human hyenas who claim property in his sinews and then in the broad day light of justify yourself by pleading obedience to a constitution which bears on its forehead the inscription to establish justice to secure the blessing of Liberty No you can't That would be violating the spirit for the sake of obeying what is really not in the letter but what the slave holders persuaded the framers that a compromise was a treachery to liberty and as much as that the framers confessed in the very act as the Madisonian papers clearly show No fine could atone for it and are we and our children bound to repeat it till the end of time Heaven forbid This is the position of the Liberty Party It goes to purify the Federal Government from the taint of supporting slavery and direct the whole constitutional energy towards its destruction and this was the doctrine of Washington who said There is only one proper and effectual mode by which it the abolition of slavery can be accomplished and that is by Legislative authority and this so far as my suffrage will go shall not be wanting Reader will you follow Washington or John C Calhoun who says I regard slavery as the most safe and simple basis for free Page institutions in the world or will you subscribe to the pirate creed of Henry Clay who said in his place in the U S Senate I know there is a visionary dogma which holds that negro slaves the dogma says men but the great compromiser did not quote it correctly cannot be the subject of property I shall not dwell long with this speculative abstraction That is property which the law declares to be property Two hundred years of Legislation have sanctioned and sanctified negro slaves as property And he Henry Clay declares that he is not for their emancipation immediate or remote We leave it to you reader whether the politics of the Liberty Party are not the only politics now worthy of an honest man's vote A war between the United States and any considerable maritime power would not be conducted at this day as it would have been even twenty years ago It would be a war of incursions aiming at revolution The first blow would be struck at us through our institutions meaning of course slavery that Ishmaelite among institutions No nation it is presumed would expect to be successful over us for any length of time in a fair contest of arms upon our own soil and no wise nation would attempt it A more promising expedient would be sought in arraying what are supposed to be the hostile elements of our social system against one another An enemy so disposed and free to land upon any part of our soil which might promise success to his enterprise would be armed with a fourfold power of annoyance We cannot safely stop short of half the naval force of the strongest maritime power in the world This will cost at least four times as much as our whole government does now The Liberty party has a better way reconcile the hostile elements by establishing justice for the slaves treat them just as our fathers wished to be treated when they said we hold these truths to be self evident c No matter if the slaves were as bad as they are black and no sane man doubts that their hearts are at least as white as those of their oppressors it would be honester safer and cheaper to have them friends than to have them enemies We may take the side of their oppressors do their unrighteous bidding be their humble volunteer slaves and as our reward obtain their contempt drain our purse to support them in idle luxury and our veins to protect them against the just retributions of heaven But when we go down with them we and our children into the gulf of national perdition will it be a very great consolation to us that their skins were white and their ancestors anglo saxon The Liberty party regards the fact of the subserviency of our Federal Government to the iniquity of slave holding a fact written on every page of our history blazoned upon our escutcheon in the Missouri Compromise branded upon the national forehead in the Florida war as not only full of wrong but full of danger It makes the abolition of slavery the paramount vital Page interest of this nation an interest as much more important than banks currency tariffs and sub treasuries as life itself is more important than the ruffles on our shirts or the blacking on our boots The Liberty party has awaked to see what all who are awake may see that while the Democratic and Whig parties suppose themselves to be engaged in settling important questions they are in reality only the puppets of a confederation of petty autocrats whose will is that nothing of that sort shall be settled whose only settled policy is to keep themselves rich by keeping free labor poor The Liberty party therefore deem it due to themselves as well as to humanity to use their political power to overthrow slavery TOUSSAINT L'OUVERT The friends of the enslaved are continually told that Africans are an inferior race If this were true it would be no good reason for enslaving them But it is not The world may safely be challenged to produce a noblier character than that of Toussaint the George Washington of St Domingo Calumny has striven to paint him a monster She has brought the printing presses of both continents to her aid but in vain Toussaint was born in slavery but his soul cannot be bound When his countrymen who had gained their liberty by the proclamation of Santhonax and Polvorre were in danger of losing it by the intrigues of former tyrants he was selected as their chief With reluctance he left the bosom of his family to which he was tenderly attached He gave union and a wise constitution to his countrymen By his bravery he repelled every foe Bonaparte it seems obtained possession of the sons of Toussaint and included them in the splendid bride which he sent to buy over the negro chief hoping by that detestable policy to make an easy conquest He was mistaken Toussaint met his boys with the heart of a father but immediately sent them back with a letter to Bonaparte the spirit of which will be shown by the following extracts CITIZEN CONSUL Your letter of the th Brumaire has been transmitted to me by Citizen Le Clerc your brother in law whom you have appointed Captain General of this Island a title not recognized by the Constitution of St Domingo The same message has restored two innocent children to the fond embraces of a doting father What a noble instance of European humanity But dear as those pledges are to me and painful as our separation is I will owe no obligations to my enemies and I therefore return them to the custody of their jailors You ask me do I desire consideration honors and fortune Most certainly I do but not of thy giving My consideration is placed in the respect of my countrymen my honors in their attachment my fortune in their disinterested fidelity Has this mean idea of personal agrandizement been held out in the hope Page that I would be induced thereby to betray the cause I have undertaken You should learn not to estimate the moral principle in other men by your own If the person who claims a right to that throne on which you are seated were to call on you to descend from it what would be your answer The power I possess has been as legitimately acquired as your own and naught but the decided voice of the people of St Domingo shall compel me to relinquish it It is not cemented by blood nor maintained by the artifices of European policy The ferocious men whose persecutions I have put stop to have confessed my clemency and I have pardoned the wretch whose dagger has been aimed at my life If I have removed from this Island certain turbulent spirits who strove to feed the flames of civil war their guilt has been first established before a competent tribunal and finally confessed by themselves Is there one of them who can say that he has been condemned unheard or untried And yet these monsters are to be brought back once more and aided by the bloodhounds of Cuba are to be uncoupled and allowed to hunt us down and devour us and this by men who dare to call themselves Christians Seven years previous to this Toussaint sent his sons then seven and nine years of age to Paris for education They were put under the care of a tutor named Coisnou Bonaparte used this man as a tool to prepare the boys for his purpose The tutor and his charge having been sent out with Leclerc Coisnou wrote from Cape Francois to Toussaint who was then at his country seat at Ennery saying The first Consul sends by me your two sons and certain important despatches Your sons will be with you to morrow provided you will give me your word that in case of your not complying with the wishes of the First Consul they shall be safely returned to the Cape Toussaint gave his word and on the morrow the boys accompanied by Coisnou were with their fond parents Toussaint had now the choice of three things He might break his word and keep his sons he might comply with the wishes of Bonaparte and keep them or he might send them back He would neither break his word nor sell his country and therefore chose to send them back It was a proverb in St Domingo that Toussaint never broke his word When Aaron was traveling through Rhode Island State with George Benson a brother in law of Mr Garrison I put up at a tavern in Providence on Criston Hill a very respectable looking tavern The tavern keeper was a man with light hair and light skin and dressed up in first rate cloth When Aaron fell in with him I gave him my purse to take care of for me till morning with forty eight dollars and seventy five cents Out of the he gave me the purse in the morning with dollars in it Besides I paid him twenty five cents for one naked night's lodging And Page Aaron thinks that his heart is more homlier with sin and iniquity than what Aaron's face is else he would'nt stole that money away from me willfully Aaron has seen in his travels them that would sooner rob from me than to help me to any And any one that will rob from Aaron will rob from the dead on the highway If they see a dead man laying in the wilderness with a thousand dollars in his pocket they will go and rob every cent away from him and then will go and say that he had not one copper in his pocket and will apply to the town to take him and bury him and the town will throw in their little mites and bury him after having so much money Aaron has been pretty much all through the State of Maine And Aaron has been in four towns where they have established Anti slavery societies Aaron in his travels has been entertained and very hospitably with sincere Christians Aaron has talked in the Baptist church in the city of Portland to between seven and eight hundred people Aaron staid among the friendly people five days and during that time there was about fifty ladies and gentlemen told Aaron they would petition to Congress to pay taxes for the valuable negroes which they vote for every three head and sold them for fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars apiece such valuable property and yet don't pay one cent of tax When Aaron was in Dedham I fell in with a great anti slavery man He keeps a store in Boston I did not learn his name He told me he wanted me a couple of days to dig potatoes for him There was a friend told Aaron that he called me an old odd simpleton I asked him what he would be willing to pay me for digging potatoes for him and he told me cents I told him I would work for him for cents if he would be willing to give me a place to sleep in the house and he told me he could not let me sleep in the house I asked him if he could not give me a pallet in the kitchen and he told me he could not but says he I will fix you a place in the barn He lived in a large house Aaron thinks he had room enough to give me a comfortable bed in the house but the trouble of it was he had not room enough in his heart to give me a place to sleep in his house Aaron thinks that he is like a great many anti slavery men What anti slavery he has got is lodged in the fore part of his skull his heart is as empty and destitute of anti slavery as a pitcher is With all his great abolition he had not abolition enough to keep me in his house Aaron says he was good enough to do his work for him With all his anti slavery Aaron says he is not one foot better than the Slaveholder in the South Aaron's master was a very profane man and he has called me a damn'd rebel since I have been away and all the scoundrels he could think of Aaron says he shall not call him a damn fool not to my head Page Christians remember those in bonds as though you were bound with them Aaron is acquainted with ministers at the South that live in open adultery with colored women He has known ministers to tie colored men and women in cellars and whip them secretly until their backs were all dripping with blood Aaron thinks these white friends in the South that pretend to call themselves christians their hands and feet are stained with African blood which I am afraid in judgment the blood of the African's and their own children's blood that are enslaved Aaron thinks it will cry so heavy against them in judgment that it will sink their poor souls right into hell When Aaron was traveling in Princeton Mass he saw an old gentleman aged seventy years of age and he told him he knew he was from the south if he denied it ever so much and he asked him how he knew Why he told me he had been all through the south and he told him he firmly believed it was the prayers of the poor slaves that saved the south from being sunk Assist runaway slaves as you would wish to be assisted When Aaron was in Norwich Conn State I got to conversing with a yellow man with light hair and blue eyes and he told me he shipped on board a ship to go to South Carolina at the time of Nathaniel Turner's insurrection in the State of Virginia They then passed a law that no free man of color should land on the soil of South Carolina The constables and other officers came down to search the vessel to see if there were any free men of color to take up and put in the Calaboose This yellow man that had light hair and blue eyes he told the constable he was the colored man and the constable told him he was a damned Yankee and a liar and went down into the kitchen and saw a white man that had black hair and black eyes but he was a full blooded white man but he took him and put him in jail and kept him four days until the vessel was ready to sail and the white man swore he would never go to the south any more and he is now one of the greatest abolitionists in the state of Connecticut This fact can be proved by several white men in Norwich Happiness of Slaves But we are further told that slaves show by their actions that they are happy They sing laugh dance and make merry He is a shallow smatterer in human nature who does not understand this that mirth is often rather the effort of the mind to throw off trouble than the evidence of happiness It shows that a man wishes to be happy and is trying for it and is oftener the means of use to get it than the proof that it exists and as to singing why do prisoners sing in jails We have all heard them Does it prove solitary cells a paradise Do jail walls dingy light and solitude make men Page so happy that they sing for joy They sing to make pleasure for themselves not to give vent to it Their singing indicates a mind seeking amusement rather than one content with what it has a mind conscious of a want and striving to satisfy it rather than one rejoicing in a full supply In illustration of this we insert a fact from Dr Channing of Boston I once passed a colored woman at work on a plantation who was singing apparently with animation and whose general manners would have led me to set her down as the happiest of the gang I said to her your work seems pleasant to you She replied no massa Supposing that she referred to something particularly disagreeable in her immediate occupations I said to her tell me then what part of your work is not pleasant She answered with emphasis No part pleasant We forced to do it What has the Church to do with Slavery This depends upon the question whether slaveholding is a sin If it is the church of Christ has much to do with it If it is a sin at all it is a very great sin It almost shuts out the blessings of the gospel from a sixth part of our people It sends a corrupting influence over our whole nation Look at the immortal beings used as property as machines for making money The evil is too mighty to be seen at one glance Take a single slave follow him through a life of hard labor without wages see how the mind deprived of proper instructions shrinks and dwindles under the whip and the fetter See how his heart plundered of its holy affections is delivered over to brutality and corruption Go to the slave auction see human forms from infancy to grey hairs sold under the hammer See human souls bartered away for cash See families that God hath joined together separated never more to meet in this world Count if you can the groans fathom the bitter woes occasioned by these separations Sum up the thousands of these scenes that take place every year in the great domestic slave trade Go along with the chained drove from the Potomac to the Mississippi Then again glance your eye upon the varied shades and features of these unhappy slaves and see the sure evidence that white masters traffic in the souls and bodies of their own children Follow out the investigation into its details and you will begin to learn the greatness of the sin But go forward a little further Follow to the judgment bar of Christ all the souls that have been trained up in slavery Before the same bar will stand the American Church Will not this immense and woful havoc of souls which God created in his image and for whom Christ died be one of the first things to be inquired of by the judge Will not every individual christian be asked What hast thou done in this matter Now look and see what the church is doing See how in its Page largest denominations it embraces in its bosom slaveholders of all sorts How it abstains from reproof How in its most solemn assemblies slaveholders are mingled and sit down together at the table of the same Lord Christians at the north say they are opposed to slavery Count the number of ministers whom they have sent to the south who are now slaveholders Ask whether these slaveholding preachers are ever kept out of the pulpit when they visit the north How many ministers preach against slavery either at the south or the north Count the number of churches that bear a testimony against the sin by excluding slaveholders like other open sinners from their communion Now can any Christian man in his senses say after such an examination that the church is ready to answer to God for American Slavery No The first thing that church has to do with slavery is to repent and purify itself from the practice of it The second is to repent of the great sin of attempting to justify slavery from the scriptures The third is to repent and show toward the injured victims of slavery the spirit of him who came to open the prison door to unbind the captive and let the oppressed go free In a man who had resided three years in New York and bore a good character was taken out of bed at midnight and with his wife and son carried back into slavery by his own cousin In the same year a white man of Newbern N C carried his four slave children to New Orleans by way of New York having sold his wife their mother to a New Orleans trader three years before In the same year a man by the name of Phillips was taken up in New York by a speculator to whom he had been sold by his father and carried to Virginia as a slave Many honorable names might be mentioned in connection with such facts Aaron thinks there are a few white people here at the north that are worse than the slaveholders at the south They tie the blacks up at the south and whip them to death for little or nothing Aaron never knew them tied up and whipped to death for nothing When Aaron was traveling in Connecticut State about two days before he got into Litchfield he felt like something was pushing him along and was so sensible of it that he laid down his bundle and looked back but could not see nothing but felt troubled in my mind I knowed that something was going to take place but did not know what it was When Aaron struck into Litchfield village I went to a tavern and there my sorrow commenced and there was eight or nine young men come up and felt of my head and there was a couple of old gentlemen come up and felt of my head and they told me I was no fool and that I had a good head Some of them wanted to know where I was from some said that I was from South Carolina but Aaron did not tell them where he was from but told him he would give him a eleven penny bit if he would give him a place to sleep The tavern keeper told me that Page he would but like Aaron and Anthony he lit Aaron up stairs to bed for the sake of a few pieces of silver Judas betrayed his Heavenly Father Just so that rebel tried to sell my sinful body to the doctors but the Lord took care of Aaron same way the Lord delivered me out of the jaws of the Arabs just so he delivered me out of the jaws of that rebel Aaron was seventy miles away from home and Aaron never expected to see the face of his wife any more but the Lord did spare him to see the face of his wife once more Slavery second born of hell Child of sin and twin of death Who thy brood of woes can tell Drawing from the kindred breath Pride and hate and lust and crime Dark revenge and cruelty Woes that end not even with time Woes that curse eternity After I lived five years in Ohio my master heard of me and sent after me but the Lord opened the hearts of friendly white men and they helped me away to the North When I struck into the Vermont State for one week I could scarce step a step cause I had froze all my toes and feet with good shoes and stockings on too Little after that time I could pull all my toe nails out like rotten meat and Aaron has not got a natural toe nail on his feet my toes was all one winter healing up And when I come to realize what the Lord has brought me through I am really astonished he has kept my unworthy body from freezing to death and from starving to death I have been abused very bad but my master has never sent me to the whipping post but he has tied me up at home and has whipped me most dreadfully and so he has and he has debared me of going to meeting he has locked me up down cellar and has kept me there for whole days and has not suffered me to eat or drink a bite of any thing for nothing else under heaven only for going to meeting and serving my heavenly Father Aaron thinks that men put too much confidence in one another they do things in the eyes of poor feeble dying men they love the praise of their poor feeble dying men better than they do their Heavenly Father's And now when a man is made pure in Christ he is pure indeed and he does not do things in the eyes of men for to get the praise of men Aaron thinks there is nothing that man can make compared with the Almighty What man makes is like his poor feeble dying body it may last between sixty and seventy years and then it fades away But what God makes is pure and holy and it lasts forever Behold the sand in the rivers how pure it is behold the waters that God creates for as it flows through the earth how pure and good it is What is better when we are almost choked for drink than a pure drink of cold water it don't make us giddy or don't make us sick it only refreshes our unworthy bodies Behold the stone how everlasting it is it lasts forever does brick last forever Man makes Page brick of clay and to the dust of clay it returns again the same way God made us unto dust we return again Aaron's views of poor feeble hollow hearted dying men A great many people tell me about this awful bad amalgamation business and they think when friendly people took me in and set me down to the table to eat with them and when their acquaintances come in to see them and see Aaron sitting up to the table eating with them it draws a dead damp on them it is like Adne and Anthony Aaron thinks if they would only look in the South where I come from it will be a complete ballot box for them they would put their hand right on their mouth and never utter another word about amalgamation or any thing else In the South white man wont suffer black man to look at white woman but they will go and force black woman and there aint eh or Anthony said about it The very old devil has got his own foot right on the slave holders own neck and Aaron thinks the poor slave holder cannot see sin and folly until he is shut up among the damned in hell forever When Aaron falls in with sincere christian people they treat me like a brother but not as a slave and they let the way faring Aaron eat when they eat and don't keep me waiting till they are done eating and then give me a crust of bread and a piece of old stale meat in the kitchen the way a great many ministers do in my travels Aaron says he should as live go to hear the devil preach as to hear some ministers because they preach one thing and practice another and don't begin to live up to their doctrine We should always practice what we preach to others for a man of words and not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds So Aaron says From Georgia's Southern mountains Potomac's either strand Where Carolina's fountains Roll down their golden sand From many a lovely river From many a sunny plain They call us to deliver Their land from error's chain Shall we whose souls are lighted With wisdom from on high Shall we to men benighted The lamp of life deny Salvation O Salvation The joyful sound proclaim Till all in every station Shall learn Messiah's name What though fair freedom's breezes Blow softly o'er our land And each one as he pleases May worship with his hand And though with lavish kindness The gospel's gifts are strown The negro in his blindness Is left to grope alone Ye masters tell his story And you ye heralds preach And to the slave his glory Let every Christian teach Till from our ransomed natures The chains of bondage fall And Jesus only Master Shall freely reign o'er all Selections from the

ashes under him Wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the Lord Is not this the fast that I have chosen To loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed

glory sing glory and honor to the Lamb That's the way it is with the Christian when his warfare is ended here below Here is a short sentence of the wayfaring Aaron When Aaron was in Hallowell in the State of Maine a gentleman told him there were strong anti slavery families lived in H but he could not get a soul good enough to take him in He thinks if it had been winter he should have frozen to death but providentially it was warm weather He laid himself down upon a harrow but the little red and black ants troubled him so he was obliged to seek shelter some where else He tarried the rest of the night in a privy When he arose he found a beautiful morning he walked four miles then asked a gentleman if he would give him some breakfast he told him he was drunk and foolish and ought to go to the Asylum He proceeded to two houses farther and there the Lord opened their hearts They provided him with a good breakfast which refreshed him much and they gave him food Page enough to last him two meals The man who refused to give me a morsel they told me was a rich man Aaron thinks he is rich in this world but is afraid he will be poor and miserable in the world to come He left God's blessing with them and proceeded on nine or ten miles when a gentleman opened his house for a meeting The hearers were very attentive they can hear other things as quick as a clap of thunder their heads are full of the knowledge of the Almighty but how does the heart stand as empty and as destitute of the love of God as a pitcher Now you do not hear of their sending many missionaries to Africa The ministers are afraid they can't get any more servants to steal God's holy word says that he that sells a man shall surely be put to death and if he is in his hands that thief shall die Aaron says that missionaries that are sent to Africa never will prosper and he believes that ministers sent to Africa are sent for mere sham and has told thousands so in his travels The last time Aaron went into Connecticut State I went to see Mr Ludlow about purchasing my freedom and when I got into the city of New Haven there I saw a man that called me by my name and Aaron was scared so that I could hardly speak A colored brother took me to Mr Boardman's house he advised me not to purchase my freedom that no free man of color could live there The first time I went to New Haven I was conversant with Mr Ludlow about purchasing my freedom He told me he would see about it the next time I went to New Haven he was gone from there he had moved to Poughkeepsie New York State so Aaron has give up purchasing his freedom and has tried to content himself here in the North God is merciful to us all and he bears with us and forbears with us A great many of the people are halted and blind so with sin and iniquity they can't see God's goodness nor his wrath until it sinks them right into hell and then they will see and cry for mercy but God does turn everlasting deaf ear to them they are shut up among the damned forever Behold his pouring wrath out upon the people in Gaudaloupe and destroyed from between so Aaron says It was about as great a place in the traffic of human souls as under the whole globe Behold his wrath pouring out upon the people upon the wide ocean and sinking thousands in the sea nothing only for their wickedness so Aaron says Behold thousands of men in the world getting mad with one another going into the field and cutting one another of by the thousands and leaving hundreds of widows throughout the world desolate with little children around them crying for bread to eat Wicked bad tyrants were sent to rule the government which do not know their right hand from their left so Aaron says has pressed out these poor men into battle has had them all cut off It is nothing only the wrath of God for their sinful wicked bad doings so Aaron says Page United States Your banner wears Two emblems one of fame Alas the other that it bears Reminds us of your shame The white man's liberty in types Stands blazoned by your Stars But what's the meaning of your stripes They mean your negro's scars Was man ordained the slave of man to toil Yoked with the brutes and fettered to the soil Weighed in a tyrant's balance with his gold NO Nature stamped us in a heavenly mould She bade no wretch his thankless labor urge Nor trembling take the pittance and the scourge Oh Hail Columbia happy land The cradle land of liberty Where none but negroes brand Or feel the lash of slavery Then let the glorious anthem peal And drown 'Britannia rules the waves ' Strike up the song that men can feel Columbia rules three million slaves A short passage selected by Aaron from God's holy word Let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me In my Father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you And if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also And whither I go ye know and the way ye know Thomas saith unto him Lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the way Jesus saith unto him I am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the Father but by me John When Aaron was in Athol I fell into a house where there were several in the house and among them was a sea captain about years old He had been dealing on the African coast I had a long talk with him and he told me the blacks were better off in the United States with their masters than they were in Africa Says he when the King's daughter dies they will slay two or three hundred to honor the King Aaron says it is a wilful and malicious lie The bible says no drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of God Also cursed is he that puts the cup to his brother's lip Also no murderer shall inherit eternal life Cursed is he that imbues his hands in his brother's blood They carry liquor into Africa and that ain't bad enough so they carry guns and powder there also shot and balls and the sword make them drunk and then compel them to fight Whichever tribe conquers will bring to the whites those whom they conquer and they will buy them by giving in exchange ribbons beads red shirts and one foolish thing and another Aaron asked the above named captain who he is afraid is going down to hell with a bundle of sin of his Page back if he didn't think God would bless the nation ten fold if they would carry bibles and hymn books there and send missionaries and teach them that there is a holy God above Aaron thinks that God would bless Africa ten fold and England and America would be blessed ten fold too Some says Where is the nation that has been treated as bad as the poor Africans Who inhabits the south part of Africa Something like two hundred miles of Africa is inhabited by the white men The natives are cut off and driven back And what ain't driven off are stolen away and brought here to America and the West India Islands Their children are scattered among the white folks and held in bonds It's true the Indians are cut off from their country and driven back but they ain't catched and made slaves of and the women taken away from them and forced by white men the way the poor Africans is The way faring Aaron Corruption earth and worms Shall but refine this flesh Till my triumphant spirit comes To put it on afresh Arrayed in glorious grace Shall these vile bodies shine And every shape and every face Look heavenly and divine Father accept the praise Of these our humble songs Till tunes of nobler sound we raise With our immortal tongues This is one of Aaron's Virginia hymns he requested me to put in Aaron's views on freedom and slavery Industry diligence and proper improvement of time are important duties of the young In youth the habits of industry are most easily acquired and the motives to it are strongest both from ambition and from duty and the prospects which the beginning of life affords Industry is not only the instrument of improvements but the foundation of pleasure Nothing is so opposite to the enjoyment of life as the state of an indolent mind Those who are strangers to industry may possess but they cannot enjoy for it is labor alone which gives a relish to pleasure We should fly from idleness as the certain parent both of guilt and ruin We should never let it cross our path while young Obtain industry in youth and it will never lose its hold Aaron says our southern brethren were reared up in complete idleness They have blacks to wait upon them to feed them and carry them to bed when they are between and years old Reared up in complete idleness then when they are reared up Page they go to gambling and cockfighting Aaron's old master and mistress owned eight slaves and among them was three females They had to take night about and sit up all night to fan their master and mistress to keep them cool after working and toiling all day Aaron says that if you females remember your brother in bonds as though you were bound with them and will try to do all that is in your power to deliver them from that sinful indolent life I long to see the day when the white people live at the South as they do at the North not debar the poor African who has to toil out under the hot boiling sun and depriving them of everything that is just and right in the sight of a holy God Aaron thinks according to the reading of the Bible that God foreknew everything God Almighty saw that Pharaoh was determined to keep the children of Israel in bondage God taught such a time that they should keep them in bondage and that time was four hundred years and no longer If it was right for the Egyptians to hold the Israelites in bonds the Lord would not have brought them out Did not the Lord say that he would bring out the Israelites and bring the Egyptians to judgment God sent Moses and Aaron to deliver them and they were something like twenty or thirty years about it and it seemed that Pharaoh was determined to hold the Israelites in bonds the devil made a complete fool of Pharaoh so that he was swallowed up in water and woke in hell Pharaoh he bound the chains tighter and tighter around the Israelites The poor wicked slaveholder that is living now upon the face of the earth does not know his right hand from his left in bringing the chains tighter and tighter upon the poor slave at the south and Aaron is afraid that they will not hearken to justice until the Lord sinks them in sin and folly in the same way he did the wicked Pharaoh God had a foreview of the white man holding the African in bonds according to the reading of the Bible because he says you may go and buy of the heathen and they shall serve you forever and they shall be inherited to your children forever that is if your hearts are wicked and bad enough to do so but remember after death God will bring you into judgment We must take the bible as it reads and it is a bitter guide against slavery if it was not a bitter guide against slavery why does it say in so many different places thou shalt not hold thy fellow mortal in bondage The slaveholders can't see to read the bible because their hearts are shut up with sin and iniquity and is stained with the African's blood When every man is dipped in the blood of Christ he is a new creature in Christ Jesus then he can see to read God's holy word and he will not read it and say it is right to hold his fellow mortal in servitude and traffic in his own flesh and blood Any man blessed with moral principles will not stand up and justify slavery and say that it is right Now we just as well might say that Page it was right for God Almighty to send down his holy Son from above for the wicked Jews to put to death God Almighty sent his holy Son down from above to preach to the people to tell them the way to fly from iniquity and be saved in his holy kingdom but the Jews were very wicked and bad like the people now a days they took the holy Lamb and slayed him God Almighty blessed the Jews with the power and he blessed them with the strength but he did not bless them in the heart with that wicked bad deed Who was it blessed them with that wicked bad deed Aaron thinks it was the devil that blessed them with that wicked bad deed else they would not have taken that holy lamb from above and put him to death Aaron thinks all the Jews that condemned Christ is now numbered among the damned in hell and always will be there until the end of time All the horrors and iniquity of slavery Aaron has seen in the State of Maryland and in the State of Kentucky and in the State of old Virginia Aaron says they do not raise rice there they do not raise cotton there this all grows in South Carolina and Georgia Aaron says that in the last of December they fetch up sugar and molasses they fetch up rice and cotton and trade it off in old Virginia for little black boys and girls between and years old and take them down into South Carolina and Georgia and sell them and get the money for them and put the money in their pockets Poor mothers are robbed of their dear little children and there is not ethram nor anthema said about it Aaron's views upon half hearted Christian people standing up in the eyes of their brethren and sisters and not only in their eyes but in the eyes of a holy God too and justifying slavery and saying it is right Aaron how did you feel and fare for about the first week after you left your master O good man after I and tother slave that come with me took start away from our master for more than one week I suffered dreadfully so I did cause I all the time did think master's overseers was close my heel behind to catch me and I liked most starved to death so I did for after I got into Ohio State with nothing with me to eat and you know I was afraid to stop at the houses where folks was to beg so afraid some enemy would catch me you know and run me back to master which I dreaded that most like death itself so I did And dear man how I lived I don't know for as true as you live I had to creep when it was dark to get where folks did keep their stuff for the hogs to eat and did eat the very swill so I did not as we read the Prodigal Son did in the Bible because he left his father's nice home but because I was going to get that freedom which God blessed me to get that freedom which you white folks have and don't think much about it Your white folks tell a good deal about this nation's liberty the fourth of July Page And folks tell me when the voters meet to choose the people's rulers to serve their master God in his fear and for the constitution liberties of every body in this big nation but I guess your white voters don't mean or else don't care much about the poor slaves because if they did I guess they would not vote to make the President of the nation out of slaveholders or some men just as bad as slaveholders if they don't hold slaves for so the folks tell me and I guess it's true When Aaron was traveling in Connecticut State I stopped at a tavern in Windsor along the Connecticut River it was pretty cool weather I asked the tavern keeper if he would'nt be good enough to give me a comfortable straw bed to sleep in for twenty five cents Hd told Aaron his customers did not like it when he took in a colored man I then asked him if he would'nt be good enough to give a pallet in the bar room he would not do it and I had to come away I went about a quarter of a mile farther and stopped to a young lady's house She told me she would willingly take me in but her husband did not like colored people and he would only scold me if I took you in She told Aaron to go to the minister he was a good benevolent man and he would give me a good comfortable bed to sleep in I went as she told me to and asked him if he would be good enough to give me a place to lie down in his kitchen and he would not do it Then I asked him if he would not give me an old blanket and let me sleep in his barn he told me he could not very well Aaron bid him good night and told him the Lord would provide somewhere for me to sleep to night I went about a quarter of a mile further and the Lord opened the heart of a white widow lady and she took Aaron in I told her if she would give me a place to lie in the kitchen I would put my hand on my mouth and thank God I was very tired and weary she told me I should not sleep in the kitchen But she gave me a candle and told me what chamber to sleep in and I went up stairs to bed and Prince Edward never slept in a better bed and she and her son made me welcome to stay over the Sabbath With all his Christianity he had not grace enough to keep Aaron one night in his barn Aaron says it did not astonish him none for Aaron thinks that two thirds of the ministers' heads are filled with the knowledge of the Almighty but their hearts are empty and destitute of the love of God as an empty pitcher They preach more for the money and for popularity than they do for the people's poor souls That is the reason why sin and iniquity so much abound in the land If these ministers were men after God's own heart slavery would not abound in the world as it does but when sorrow and affliction comes against them they will flee like lightning but they cannot preach unless you give them fifteen or sixteen hundred dollars a year then they will preach for preaching free salvation to all mankind If they were men after God's own heart they would Page preach for two or three hundred and they will not rob the widow and the halt and the blind PIOUS SLAVEHOLDERS BY ELIZUR WRIGHT I have no more disposition than I ever had to demonstrate how much men may dabble with dishonesty or defile themselves with oppression and yet be saved how much men may vocally or silently consent with thieves and yet be honest how much they may involve themselves with laws and customs worthy of devils and yet deserve sympathy and consolation at our hands as Christians There may be Christian pickpockets Christian horse thieves Christian swindlers for aught I know I am not profound on this argument But I think such Christians do no honor to a church much less to a pulpit January th Aaron was traveling through Assonet I stayed all night at the house of Mr Nichols and he entertained me very hospitably I left his house next day between three and four o'clock you all know the days are very short and cold here at the north When I left his house the wind blew very cold and night come upon me and I thought I should freeze I asked eight or nine families to entertain me but I could not get any of them to keep me and I traveled on and God opened the heart of a good Samaritan and she entertained Aaron and she entertained me like a brother and her husband was almost three thousand miles away from home and not a soul was in that house but her and four small children and yet she was not afraid to entertain the wayfaring Aaron It was a dreadful keen cold night but the Lord watched over all that dwelt under that roof and brought us all to behold the light of another beautiful morning and she refreshed my unworthy body with a first rate breakfast fried beef steak and good light biscuit and she gave me a first rate cup of tea that struck through every nerve and that was not all she done for Aaron but she told her oldest son to go out and hitch up the horse and we got in and she toated me all the way to Fall River that is five miles she carried me and she gave Aaron cents in money She was one white lady out of a thousand She took Aaron in and kept me from freezing to death and she gave me first rate victuals to refresh my unworthy body Her name I have forgotten but her face will always be in my presence forever She is the daughter of the Rev Mr Anderson of Assonet he has been Pastor of the Church in Assonet for years He was a revolutioner Aaron has formerly been a slave in the south and has seen pretty hard times and also in the north and in the west Aaron has been through all the New England States and has told his sorrow and affliction in thirty two churches besides in halls and school houses and dwelling houses These sorrows and afflictions can be proved by seventy thousand men which the poor slave has to undergo in Page getting away from the hard task masters Aaron says if the white men were all like Ward Richards in West Bridgewater and Jesse Torrey in North Abington Mr Foster in New Hampshire State who was dragged out of the Church in Nashua Orson Murray in Vermont State who prints the Vermont Telegraph Mr Gay in Hubbardston Mr Bradford who preaches in the Congregationalist Church in Hubbardston Mr Garrison who was dragged through the streets of Boston with a rope round his neck Mr Hanning in Cadus in Ohio State Mr Stansbury in Lancaster Ohio Dr Caleb Swan of Easton there would not be a slave in the United States but they are not like these men Aaron thinks that God has got a crown richly laid up in heaven for these men who has suffered heavy persecution on the right hand and on the left because they have stood up for the rights and liberties of the poor African man who is good enough to stand up and fight for the country in time of trouble and who have been slain down by hundreds but are not good enough to enjoy their freedom under these free and independent colors These free and independent colors float at the Capitol Aaron says in this free and independent country there are almost three millions slaves kept A lash on the back is valued at cents in Virginia and Illinois The law which is common to both States runs thus In all cases where free persons are punished by fine servants shall be punished by whippingafter the rate of twenty lashes for every eight dollars so that no servant shall receive more than forty lashes at any one time only dollars worth of whipping at one time The Slave Joseph Come said Judah and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites And the rest agreed to it Then there passed by Midianite merchantmen slave traders and they lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver poor boy His father had sent him on a kind errand to his brothers and was waiting for him to return A Southern gentleman in the debate at Lane Seminary thus describes the punishment of the paddle A bricklayer a neighbor of ours owned a very smart young negro man who ran away but was caught When his master got him home he stripped him naked tied him up by his hands in plain sight and hearing of the academy and the public green so high that his feet could not touch the ground then tied them together and put a long board between his legs to keep him steady After preparing him in this way he took a paddle bored it full of holes and commenced beating him with it He continued it leisurely all day At night his flesh was literally pounded to jelly It was two weeks before he was able to walk No one took any notice of it No one thought any wrong was done Page The following instance occurred near Natchez See N Y Evangelist for Jan A planter purchased a notorious runaway He gave him to understand that he could elope if he chose probably in a tone which warned him of the consequences The negro took him at his word but was soon taken and flogged very severely His master then opened the gate and told him to go again he did so but was in a few days retaken His master flogged him if I recollect till he fainted and yoked him in the fence between rails during the day The wretched negro escaped a third time but was able to elude pursuit only for a few days This time his master beat him till his back was almost raw knocked out his eye teeth yoked him in the fence and poured spirits of turpentine over his bleeding wounds The poor negro fainted on account of the intensity of his sufferings My informant received his account from the planter The two following cases are communicated by Mr Birney of Kentucky Not very long ago in Lincoln county Kentucky a female slave was sold to a southern slaver under most afflicting circumstances She had at her breast an infant boy three months old The slaver did not want the child on any terms The master sold the mother and retained the child She was hurried away immediately to the depot at Louisville to be sent down the river to the southern market The last news my informant had of her was that she was lying sick in the most miserable condition her breasts having risen inflamed and bursted During the winter at Nashville a slaver was driving his train of fellow beings down to the landing to put them on board a steam boat bound for New Orleans A mother among them having an infant of about ten months old to carry in her arms could not keep pace with the rest The slaver waited till she came up to where he was standing he snatched it from her arms and handing it over to a person who stood by made him a present of it The mother bereft in a single moment of her last comfort was driven on without delay to the boat On the side of the oppresser was power but she had no comforter A man I did not learn his name in Scott county Tennessee kept a room apart which no one entered but himself and slaves One poor man he kept in it two or three days going in often and whipping him No one of the family dared if they wished to go to his rescue His cries and groans were so dreadful that the third night a young lady living there got the key secretly and went to the room A most appalling sight presented itself to her view the floor covered with blood and pieces of flesh She released the almost murdered man he fled and had not been heard from The shrieks extorted by this cruel man were often heard on neighboring plantations at midnight day dawn and other times Page THE BLIND MOTHER I saw a mother in her arms Her infant child was sleeping The mother while her infant slept Her guardian watch is keeping Around its little tender form Her snow white arm was flung And o'er its little infant head Her bending tresses hung Sleep sweetly on my darling babe My own my only child But as she spoke the infant woke And on its mother smiled But oh no friendly answering smile The mother's visage graced For she was blind and could not see The infant she embraced But now he lisped his mother's name And now the mother pressed Her darling much loved baby boy Unto her widowed breast But sudden anguish seized her mind Her voice was sweetly wild My God she cried but grant me sight One hour to see my child To look upon its cherub face And see its father's there But pardon if the wish be wrong A widow'd mother's prayer And as she spoke her anguish grew More loud and yet more wild And closer to her aching breast She clasped her orphan child We shall be over run with them If Ghosts were flesh and blood and flew in flocks the spectres of beggary and crime conjured up by we shall be over run with them would darken all our northern air This objection when waged against our measures implies the conviction that they will be successful When argued against emancipation it implies that slaves are kept where they are against their wills It implies also that those who make it would keep their slaves in their chains rather than run the risk of having here and there a colored neighbor If the objector were to see the slaveholder knocking off the chains throwing away the whip and giving wages to his laborers he must needs cry out stop stop if you pay your laborers and treat them well they will quit you and rush to the north Who makes this outcry An American who while he boasts that his country is an asylum for the oppressed of all nations would perpetuate the oppression and robbery of his own countrymen lest some of them should find an asylum in his own neighborhood But his objection is a bald prophecy based on no facts contradicted by history and human nature If slavery were abolished the slaves would choose to stay at the south as hired laborers rather than come to the north Reasons They are already there and the trouble expense distance to be traveled time necessary for journey c would forever dissuade the main body from migration to the north There is far more room for them in the slave holding portions of the U S than in the non slaveholding In the former there is one third more territory and one third less population than in the latter The climate of the South is congenial to them that of the North uncongenial Page There is far less prejudice against the colored man there than in the North They are remarkable for their local attachments This is one of their peculiarities every where wherever they are to be found their aversion to a change of residence especially to a distant removal is proverbial All travelers in Africa unite in this testimony Edward's History of the West Indies Walsh's Sketches of Brazil Matherson's Notices of Sumatra Dr Dickson's Mitigation of Slavery Sturge and Harvey's West Indies in Thome and Kimball's Six months in Antigua Barbadoes and Jamaica abound with testimony to this trait We insert from the latter work a few testimonies of ex slave holders in Antigua The negroes are not disposed to leave the estates on which they have lived unless they are forced away by bad treatment H Armstrong Esq Nothing but bad treatment on the part of the planters has ever caused the negroes to leave the estates on which they were accustomed to live S BOURNE ESQ The negroes are remarkably attached to their homes JAMES HOWELL ESQ The negroes are peculiar for their attachment to their homes S BARNARD ESQ Love of home is very remarkable in the negroes It is a passion with them Dr DANIELS Member of Council An aged planter said they have very strong local attachments They love their little hut and will endure almost any hardship before they will desert that spot and Aaron says he has formerly been a slave at the South is eye witness to it Messrs Thome and Kimball say Such are the sentiments of West India planters expressed in the majority of cases spontaneously and mostly in illustration of other statements We did not hear a word that implied an opposite sentiment One gentleman observed that it was a very common saying with the negroes Me nebber leave my bornin ground i e birth place The slaves rarely run away from mild masters now When they become their own masters and are protected by just laws why should they leave their native region to roam among strangers in an uncongenial clime Slaves when emancipated in the South stay there unless driven out Farther he says the forces were daily increasing and they felt themselves so strong and secure that they had commenced several plantations on the fertile banks of the Apalachicola which would have yeilded them every article of sustenance can slaves take care of themselves and which would consequently in a short time have rendered their establishment quite formidable and highly injurious to the neighboring States Page Heard ye the wail that was borne on the breeze From the land of the south it was wafted Where cruel oppression reposeth at case And liberty's scions are blasted 'Twas the wail of the black man he longs to be free From the scourges of oppression that binds him And he weeps when he thinks of his home o'er the sea And the friends that he left behind him For once he was free in the land of his birth Till the white man o'er the ocean came sailing And tore him away from his home and his hearth While they turned a deaf ear to his wailing They bound him in chains and dragged him away And in a dark dungeon confined him Like a felon deprived of the light of the day With strong iron chains they did bind him They then hoisted their flag 'Twas the flag of the free And set sail for their home o'er the billows And talked with delight of the friends they should see At home 'neath their own native willows But alas for the black man no kind friends await Him to greet in the land of the stranger Oppression and slavery must now be his fate And no kind hand will shield him from danger And this in a land where the rich and the poor Proudly boast of their free institutions The scourge of the tyrant he must meekly endure Nor claim for his wrongs restitution America boast not thy freedom again Till thou hast crushed the foul head of the demon Till slavery no more shall exist but in name And thy banners wave o'er none but freemen Aaron was acquainted with a yellow man that lived in Virginia in the neighborhood where he lived and the first wife that this man took belonged to his master and he lived with her about six years her master then sold her and two children to a man who was going to Georgia he then swore that he never would take another woman that belonged to his master he then took a woman about eleven miles from where he lived and they had three children His master whipped him three times for going to see his wife and children and the last time he whipped him it was the cause of his death he lived about a week afterwards and when his poor wife got the news she became crazy and died with grief in about a month and Page left three little children in the hands of the Arabs to be bought and sold and perhaps whipped to death as their parents were Aaron has known several instances beside where slaves have been tied up and whipped to death by their masters Aaron does not know his age correctly but supposes he was about or years of age when he left Virginia and in all his life time in the State of Virginia he has never known of but one instance of a slave killing his master The slave was a man three fourths white and his master whipped him severely for gambling and he took a knife and run his master through the heart and after he had killed his master his father in law shot the slave down without judge or jury This circumstance Aaron says run through the State of Virginia like lightning if it had been a white man that killed a black man there would not have been ethron or Anthony said about it this circumstance took place in Virginia or years ago When Aaron was in Providence there was a white gentleman took me to a colored woman's house to stay over night and I had a long talk to her before I went to bed and she told me she was acquainted with a rich white gentleman who lived in Providence and she used to go and wash every Tuesday for that family and he did not enjoy good health and in the winter season he used to go to the south for his health The third winter he went he took a colored boy with him to wait upon him When he came home he did not bring the boy with him and when asked concerning the boy he said the boy died at the south God spared him to see another winter and he went to the south again and took another colored boy with him and when he returned in the spring no boy came with him and when asked what had become of the boy he said he had died and that the southern climate did not agree with the northern negroes A few months afterwards he was taken sick and the day before he died he called to his attendants to take away those colored boys take away those colored boys and the doctor and his friends thought it was the devil he imagined he saw About a week after he died the last colored boy he took to the South with him came home His parents were astonished and rejoiced to see him and asked why he did not return with the gentleman he went out with He said the gentleman sold him His parents were astonished and indignant that a gentleman in whom they reposed so much confidence should have been guilty of such an inhuman act and had he been living he would have been punished to the full extent of the law Aaron thinks when the man died he went right to hell for the Bible says He that stealeth a man and selleth him shall surely be put to death if he is found in his hands that thief shall die When Aaron was in Braintree he talked there in the Baptist meeting house while in the house a gentleman came and shook hands with him and said he was not an abolitionist but says he I pity the poor slave but one half of the abolitionists are so false Page I cannot take side with them said he I am acquainted with a minister in Braintree who professed to be a warm advocate of antislavery and lectured in many of the neighboring towns on the subject He went to the south and married a woman who owns human beings He comes back and apologises for it and says slavery is not so bad as he formerly thought it was He has found out it is a money making business Aaron thinks he is like Lot and Abraham when they were traveling together they fell out about their herds of cattle and Abraham said I pray thee let there be no strife between my herd and thy herd Lot lifted up his eyes and discovered all the plains of Sodom and Gomorrah and it was well watered and well grassed but the people were wicked before the eyes of man and before the eyes of the Almighty but Lot cared more for the good things of this world than for the company of gospel people Abraham was a man shod with gospel grace he was unmovable in the work of the Almighty and he did not go down there and dwell with those wicked people but directed his way among the righteous Our land of the south like Sodom and Gomorrah is blessed by nature with all that can add to the comfort of man But the institution of slavery pollutes the moral and religious character and those who live in the north who go down to dwell with them are but too often corrupted and made partakers in the gain of their unworthy traffic and all their correct ideas of the rights of our fellow beings disappear before the love of the root of all evil When Aaron was in Bellingham I fell in with a white gentleman who appeared to be interested and wanted to have me talk And said he come let us go to the house of the Baptist minister I went with him to the house of the minister and had a talk with him And Aaron was very degraded in the minister's eyes with all his Christianity And the gentleman who accompanied me insisted on my lecturing He thought I had not sense enough to tell what I had seen all the days of my life concerning slavery He gave out notice however for me to lecture but took good care to prevent my lecturing in the meeting house but consented that I should hold forth in the school house For I should be laughed at and made game of by a parcel of loafers who would gather around Aaron has lectured in several meeting houses among which may be named one in Newburyport and one in New Bedford and in several other places to large audiences Aaron thought if he was not good enough to lecture in the meeting house he would not lecture at all This clergyman like a great many others pretend to remember his brother in bonds as bound with them when he does not remember his brother in bonds as bound with them In Aaron's travels he falls among ministers who will entertain him and entertain him very hospitably that is if I will stop and attend meeting and hear them preach And then if I am laughed at and made game of what do they care But when Aaron Page asks them to get up a meeting for him that draws a damper on their feelings I do not know what they are afraid of except that degraded as I am I may throw some light before the people so that their congregations may be broken up so that they will not have fifteen or sixteen hundred dollars to put into their pockets yearly on which to live in fine style while their poor brethren at the south are in the worst of bondage Aaron thinks they preach more for money than for the people's poor souls Haste makes waste and waste makes want Let us be certain that we have got the mote out of both our own eyes and then we can see to pick it out of our brother's eye Whenever a man is born of God then he is a new creature in Christ Jesus Christ has in that white framed a hope of glory and he is in Christ and therefore they are as one God will not bless and convert our souls from sin and iniquity unknown to us When God blesses and converts our unworthy souls we have the witness abide within Now brethren and sisters let us be wise and consistent let us remember the sin and iniquity that abounds in our land When our brethren come to us to get assistance for the foreign mission we will have our eyes open then we can tell them with a clear conscience of the horrors and evil and iniquity that abound in our land Behold the horrors and sin and iniquity of slavery Whenever all of our hearts are cleansed from sin and iniquity then we can see the horrors and evils of slavery and every wicked bad sin that abounds in our gospel and christianized country Aaron's views on the state of things Old Beelzebub the father of sin and iniquity he tempted me till I like to loose my soul in iniquity but blessed Michael helped me out of my distress and armed me with the sword and shield to march for Canaan's land Sweet fields arrayed in living green and rivers of delight no chilling winds nor poisonous breath can reach that happy shore glittering crowns and glaring swords will there our armies be We'll sing and shout forevermore around our father's throne Here is a short sentence of the way faring Aaron Reader here is a short sentence from poor Nat Turner who suffered almost everything in the swamps for one year at Northampton finally he was taken and hung this took place about fifteen years ago Human flesh bought and sold and chained together rank and file the mastiff is kept to hunt human souls and this is all done over God's holy word We have a great many meetings in the southern countries what good does it do We are commanded to watch and pray and keep old Lucifer under our feet whenever any one is pure in the blood of Christ they do this The Christians in the south instead of keeping Lucifer right under their feet they let Lucifer have his foot right on their necks and by and by Page they'll fall and great will be their fall for they will fall to rise no more This is what the wayfaring Aaron requested me to write for him When I was in Ohio about miles from Chillicothe Aaron and Ben pitched a tent along the Sciota river and there we remained for four days Aaron goes and gets a pot that they keep in the barn to grease the wagons and takes it to my little tent and cleans it and then goes and gets raw potato parings out of the swill and cooks them One day Aaron went and got an old shank bone and cooked it It was a great place for hunting Aaron went out to gather some chips early in the morning a hunter came very near shooting Aaron through the head we were obliged to leave that spot as it was dangerous for us to tarry there We didn't put up quarters any where till we reached Lancaster the way we went was one hundred miles After I was in Lancaster years I got to conversing with Mr Stansbery he told Aaron that he had traveled all along the Sciota river and I told him about my little tent I had built along the Sciota river and he told me that he saw the same tent and Aaron thinks it is there to this day Some days after I left my master I thought I heard some one following me It was in a woody swampy piece of land I turned my shoes hind side before to make them think I was going the other way and went about two miles in the swamp and Aaron thinks the Lord looked down upon me and put wisdom in my unworthy head On the th of May Aaron was traveling through Spencer in Mass he fell into the house of was hungry tired and weary and asked Mr for leave to lie down upon his kitchen floor and understood him yes He went in and saw his little daughter whom he asked to lend him a teapot to make himself some tea Her mother came and looked cross and savage at him and asked what he wanted He replied I want to make a little tea She refused him and liberty to lie upon the floor and bid him be off a black rascal He went on but God opened the heart of a good Samaritan who would not allow him to make use of his own but gave him of her tea and gave him a bed to rest his unworthy body which the other and his wife had not grace enough in their heart to do DEUT At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release And this is the manner of the release every creditor that lendeth aught unto his neighbor shall release it he shall not exact it of his neighbor or of his brother because it is called the Lord's release Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release save when there shall be no poor among you for the Lord shall greatly bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe to do all these commandments Page which I commanded thee this day For the Lord thy God blesseth thee as he promised thee and thou shalt lend unto many nations but thou shalt not borrow and thou shalt reign over many nations but they shall not reign over thee If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee thou shalt not harden thine heart nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart saying the seventh year the year of release is at hand and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother and thou givest him naught and he cry unto the Lord against thee and it be sin unto thee Thou shalt surely give him and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him because that for this thing the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy works and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto for the poor shall never cease out of the land Therefore I command thee saying thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother to thy poor and to thy needy in thy land And if thy brother an Hebrew man or an Hebrew woman be sold unto thee and serve thee six years then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee And when thou sendest him out free from thee thou shalt not let him go away empty thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock and out of thy floor and out of thy winepress of that wherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him Shall the United States which cannot bear the bonds of a king cradle the bondage which a king is abolishing Shall a republic be less free than a monarchy Shall we in the vigor and buoyancy of our manhood be less energetic in righteousness than a kingdom in its age C STEWART Shall every flap of England's flag Proclaim that all around are free From farthest Ind to each blue crag That beetles o'er the Western Sea And shall we scoff at Europe's kings When freedom's fire is dim with us And round our country's altar clings The damning shade of slavery's curse Go let us ask of Constantine To lose his grasp on Poland's throat And beg the lord of Mahmoud's line To spare the struggling Suliote Will not the scorching answer come From turbaned Turk and fiery Russ Go loose your fettered slaves at home Then turn and ask the like of us WHITTIER We northern men have to pay taxes for so many head of cattle and so many head of horses and if they own houses they have to pay taxes for them and if they own land they have to pay taxes for that Now our white brethren at the south have to pay taxes for these houses and lands and their horses and cattle so Aaron says Aaron says for their human cattle they do not pay one cent Page of tax and for these human cattle they will sell for eight to fifteen hundred dollars so much profit to them and yet do not pay taxes for them Aaron says that there was a gentleman in the town of Lynn told him the town of Lynn had lost one million dollars by the south Aaron says there was a gentleman in the town of R told him that the town of R had lost fifty or sixty thousand dollars and several other towns that had lost money by the white brethren in the south so Aaron says At Norfolk there is between two and three hundred men kept there What are they kept there for Why to keep the blacks in slavery Our free and independent colors float there at the capital so they do and Aaron says there is almost three million slaves held in bondage under these floating colors Now where does the support come from that keeps these soldiers there Why pretty much the whole heft comes out of the north You white friends will all unite together instead of rising and shaking the dust off your feet and having nothing to do with them bad tarlims in the south but Aaron is afraid that you white friends will unite together and will leave you as poor as poverty as the poor slave is before you see the horrors and the evils and the iniquity of slavery Aaron has traveled through twelve different States and one hundred miles in Canada and never was entertained so hospitable in my life as I was by Mr Ward Richards in West Bridgewater And if I never see him no more I pray God I may have grace to meet in heaven And I was traveling in South Bridgewater and fell in with a white lady but I did not learn her name and I asked her if she would not be good enough to sell me a slice of wheat bread and because I called her honey she got very angry with me I did not mean any harm by calling her honey but she had a great deal of southern temper in her but she is unconscious of everything that's reasonable She called Aaron a damned black scoundrel and all the names she could think of and hailed to her husband to come away from the lower part of the field and he came running with a hoe and leaped over a fence about four foot high and he hollered ho ye dam'd rebel you what have you been a doing to my wife you dam'd black scoundrel you My answer was as quick as possible to him I have been doing nothing but that did not seem to be of any satisfaction to him and then I had to spring for a rock as quick as possible or he would split me through with the hoe Aaron was travelling the other side of the Juniatta river I fell in to a white lady's house and was almost starved to death She was a tall slim lady and fair complected and I asked her for a piece of bread and meat and she filled my hat full Aaron thinks she had a fair heart too for because she done as God commanded her to do And how was that To divide with your brethren and Page Aaron set down alongside of the Juniatta river in the State of Pennsylvania and begin to eat out of my hat and Aaron saw a white man come along ha says he ye dam'd scoundrel you get up and come to me I got up as soon as I could but I had no idea of coming to him I stood and considered and he told me to lay down my hat and come quick but I laid for the water as quick as possible and Aaron came across the water and some places the water took me up to my neck and the wind blew very hard and took off my hat and my bread and good nice meat with my hat sailed down the river I consider all that nothing but the Lord took care of my unworthy life and saved me from drowning and not only that but kept my body out of the hands of that Arab and in the evening Aaron crawled into a barn and the Lord took care of my unworthy body in that barn as well as the king in his palace with his army of soldiers around him What a blessed thing it is for any poor soul to put their trust in the Lord The Lord has took care of Aaron through sorrow and affliction the Lord has delivered me out of the hands of a hard taskmaster he has blessed my unworthy body on free soil and my face Zionward towards his holy kingdom Since Aaron has come away from my hard taskmaster I have fell among sincere Christian people Sometimes I think I never will have grace to meet these dear friendly white people in heaven Know that the day's coming that the slaveholder and the slave has got to stand before the tribunal bar and there render account before a holy God the same as the murderer stretched on the gallows before judges and jurors When we are brought before a holy God whose judgment is quick and powerful sharper than a two edged sword his judgment is not like man from to years his judgments are forever Whilst thousands of years roll around If we die in the full triumph of a holy faith will take a leap right into his holy kingdom and there will live forever And if we die with our hearts shut with sin and iniquity we'll go down to hell and there will burn forever When Aaron was in the town of Kennebunk in the State of Maine I fell in there with a white friend he treated Aaron hospitably and got up a meeting for me before I left the place There was a white gentleman asked me if I knew a man by the name of Ward Richards a dam'd scoundrel in West Bridgewater I told him I knew no such person but I knew a Christian gentleman by the name of Ward Richards Do you know what the Bible says if you don't like your brother you must not persecute him Aaron thinks you are as destitute of the Bible and every other good moral principle or else you would not stand up and persecute your white brother who has done you no harm because he stands up for equal rights for the poor degraded down trodden African man When Aaron was in Princeton he fell in a white lady's house Page and I got conversing with her about one thing and another and she told Aaron of a lady about sixty years of age and she was always very bitter against the anti slavery cause They had an anti slavery meeting in the place one of the anti slavery women went and conversed with this old lady and she got very angry with this anti slavery woman and she told if five cents would free all the negroes in the south she would not give it She was knitting as usual about four days afterwards when she fell down dead and some think it was a judgment of the Almighty upon her for her wicked bad doings Since Aaron has left home I have traveled through about all the free States I have been mobbed in a great many places but thank God I have not had any bones broke His life has been threatened but my Heavenly Father has looked down from above and saved my unworthy life I have been highly threatened to be sent back to my hard task master Old Beelzebub the father of sin and iniquity if he had his way Aaron would have been sent back to his hard task master long ago Thank God that God is above the devil and he has kept Aaron's unworthy body out of the hands of his hard task master This is what the way faring Aaron requested me to write An abolitionist of Leominster THE WORN OUT SLAVE A preacher traveling through the Southern States was rowed across a ferry by a pious old negro who had labored hard through early manhood and middle age to purchase freedom for himself and his wife and he mourned that old age and loss of strength would compel him to leave all his children in slavery He laid his hand on his breast and said Master has all my strength and I have these old bones His head was white and his eyes were dim And his face was marked by wo The vigor of youth had passed from him And labor had bent him low He gave the oars his remnant of strength As the shallop left the shore And he told his tale of grief at length Ere the stream was ferried o'er He looked on one with his eyes' dim ray That he ne'er shall see again Until the break of endless day Far beyond a tyrant's reign Master he said you're a child of God His seal is upon your face Poor negro has felt his chast'ning rod And gloried too in his grace The sun that rose upon the master's morn Rejoiced o'er a free born babe But the light that broke when I was born Looked down on a fetter'd slave I grew a pace to my bitter lot Too soon felt my heavy chain And often I cried Oh why will not Earth take back her child again I thought perhaps if I bent to toil That heaven might let me see A day in which I could tread the soil And breathe the air of the free I toiled at morn and I toiled at eve And I toiled in the mid day sun I rested not when they gave me leave And said that my work was done I yielded not to summer's heat Nor turned from the winter's frost Nor sheltered myself from storms that beat Lest a copper should be lost I paid for myself I have paid for my wife But our sands are nearly run And the freedom I've bought at the end of life Would have come with my setting sun He smote his breast with his eyes on high In a voice of subdued tones Said Master has all my strength and I Have nothing but these old bones Time adds a weight to each month that rolls We soon shall rest in our graves We trust in Christ to receive our souls BUT WE LEAVE OUR CHILDREN SLAVES Page When told that woman should not meddle with slavery point to the widow of Lovejoy left alone to rear her fatherless child and say that in a country where slavery strews with desolation a woman's hearth stone it becomes a woman to seek for the cause and if possible to apply a remedy You have the authority of slaveholders for concerning yourselves even with politics At a political meeting in Mississippi the following toast was drank The Ladies in the dark hour of our revolutionary struggle they nobly stood by us they will again do so in a struggle for correct principles See Manchester Mi Whig Oct When you are keenly afflicted by meeting coldness apathy and indifference then offer to lend the Narrative of Charles Ball or James Williams or some other publication where the slave speaks for himself Tell the story of Mary Brown of Ohio who was stolen from her free parents in Washington city The committee who prepared the Ohio Report of which A Wattles was chairman say they are assured by those who knew Mary at the South that her statements may be implicitly relied on Her manner in telling her story was artless and simple bespeaking conscious truth She lived with her parents until the death of her mother One day when near the Potomac bridge Mr Humphrey the sheriff overtook her and told her she must go with him She inquired what for He made no reply but told her to come along He took her immediately to a slave auction Mary said she was free but Mr Humprey contradicted her and the sale went on The auctioneer soon struck her off for to a Mississippi trader and she was taken directly to the jail After a few hours she was handcuffed chained to a man slave and started in a drove of about forty for New Orleans The handcuffs so swelled her wrists that they were obliged to take them off at night and put fetters on her ankles In the morning the handcuffs were again put on Thus they traveled for two weeks wading rivers being whiped up all day and beaten at night if they did not get their distance Mary says she frequently waded rivers in her chains with water up to her waist It was in October and the weather cold and frosty After traveling thus twelve or fifteen days her arms and ankles became so swollen that she felt she could go no farther Blisters would form on her feet as large as dollars which at night she would have to open while all day the shackles would cut into her lacerated wrists They had no beds and usually slept in barns or out on the naked ground was in such misery when she lay down that she could only lie and cry all night Still they drove them on for another week Her spirits became so depressed and she grieved so much about leaving her friends that she could not eat and every time the trader caught her crying he would beat her accompanying it with dreadful curses Page She was at length seized with a burning fever and the trader fearing he should lose her carried her the remainder of the way in a wagon When they arrived at Natchez they were all offered for sale and as Mary was still sick she begged that she might be sold to a kind master She sometimes made this request in presence of purchasers but was always insulted for it and after they were gone the trader punished her for such presumption in revealing her sickness and thus preventing her sale On one occasion he tied her up by her hands so that she could only touch the end of her toes to the floor This was soon after breakfast he kept her thus suspended whipping her at intervals through the day at evening he took her down She was so much bruised that she could not lie down for more than a week afterwards The rest of her history while a slave is full of horror Her case differs a little from thousands except that she escaped to reveal her woes while they suffer and die unheard The despatches

of a leader of fugitives called Squire the Brigand of the Swamp While they can support a gang and have a camp we may expect our negroes to run away In the same article he says the place whose delight had kept Squire so long from the happiness of slavery and to which the happy slaves would of course escape was a marsh almost impenetrable to our citizens During our two wars with Great Britain a multitude of slaves fled from their masters and joined the British forces To furnish the reader some data for judging of the number that escaped during the Revolutionary war we insert the following extract from Ramsay's History When the British evacuated Charleston S C in Governor Matthews demanded the restoration of some thousand of negroes who were within their lines These however were but a

No p There were at Natches on the plantations a considerable number of negroes nearly all of whom had joined the murderers of their masters in order to gain their freedom and had followed their new

give freedom to any of them That the disappointment caused by this declaration should lead to the consequences which followed was to be expected I had good reason for anticipating the escape of all the laboring men of any value to the Northern States as soon as I could leave home Slaves know when to seem contented Testimony of James Bradley an emancipated slave He bought his freedom in when nearly years old In an account of his life in the Oasis speaking on this point he says I do not believe there ever was a slave who did not long for liberty I was never acquainted with a slave however well he was treated who did not long to be free There is one thing about this that people in the free States do not understand When they ask slaves whether they wish for liberty they answer No and very likely they would say they would not leave their master for the world But at the same time they desire liberty more than any thing else The truth is if a slave shows any discontent he is sure to be treated worse and worked the harder for it and every slave knows this When they are alone all their talk is about liberty liberty It is the great thought and feeling that fills the mind for all the time So Aaron says ISAIAH ch A short chapter that the wayfaring Aaron took out of God's holy word Behold the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither is the ear heavy that it cannot hear But your iniquities have separated between you and your God and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue hath muttered perverseness None calleth for justice nor any pleadeth for truth they trust Page in vanity and speak lies they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity They hatch cockatrice' eggs and weave the spider's web he that eateth of their eggs dieth and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper Their webs shall not become garments neither shall they cover themselves with their works their works are works of iniquity and the act of violence is found in their hands Their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting and destruction are in their paths The way of peace they know not and there is no judgment in their goings they have made them crooked paths Whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace Therefore is judgment far from us neither doth justice overtake us We wait for light but behold obscurity for brightness but we walk in darkness We grope for the wall like the blind and we grope as if we had no eyes we stumble at noon day as in the night we are in desolate places as dead men We roar all like bears and mourn sore like doves we look for judgment but there is none for salvation but it is far off from us For our transgressions are multiplied before thee and our sins testify against us and as for our iniquities we know them In transgressing and lying against the Lord and departing away from our God speaking oppression and revolt conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood And judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth afar off for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter Yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey and the Lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment And he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him For he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak According to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun When the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him And the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob saith the Lord Page As for me this is my covenant with them saith the Lord My spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed saith the Lord from henceforth and forever I asked a man of sorrows and of tears Whose looks told anguish pressed him more than years He mused awhile and then distinctly said Life is a burden would that I were dead I asked a Christian who had early strayed From virtue's paths this was the answer made Life is a precious boon to mortals given Which if well spent will be renewed in heaven Here is a short sentence of the wayfaring Aaron A Section from the Life of Moses Grandy late a slave When I reached Deep Creek I went to the house of Captain Edward Minner He was very glad to see me for in former days I had done much business for him he said how sorry he had been to hear that I was at field work He inquired where I was going I said to Norfolk to get some of the merchants to let me have money to buy myself He replied 'What did I always say to you Was it not that I would let you have the money at any time if you would only tell me when you could be sold ' He called Mrs Minner into the room and told her I could be sold for my freedom she was rejoiced to hear it He said 'Put up your horse at Mr Western's tavern for you need go no farther I have plenty of old rusty dollars and no man shall put his hand on your collar again to say you are a slave Come and stay with me to night and in the morning I will get Mr Garret's horse and go with you ' Next morning we set off and found master at Major Farrence's at the cross canal where I knew he was to be that day to sell his share of the canal When I saw him he told me to go forward home for he would not sell me I felt sick and sadly disappointed Captain Minner stepped up to him and showed him the paper he had given me saying 'Mr Sawyer is not this your hand writing ' He replied 'Mistress said the last word when I came away I was not to sell him but send him home again ' Captain Minner said 'Mind gentlemen I do not want him for a slave I want to buy him for freedom He will repay me the money and I shall not charge him a cent of interest for it I would not have a colored person to drag me down to hell for all the money in the world A gentleman who was by said it was a shame I should be so treated I had bought myself so often that Mr Sawyer ought to let me go The very worst man as an overseer over the persons employed in digging the canal Mr Wiley M'Pherson was there he was never Page known to speak in favor of a colored person even he said that Mr Sawyer ought to let me go as I had been sold so often At length Mr Sawyer consented I should go for and would take no less I wished Captain Minner to give the extra and not stand about it I believe it was what M'Pherson said that induced my master to let me go for he was well known for his great severity to colored people so that after even he had said so master could not stand out The Lord must have opened M'Pherson's heart to say it I have said that M'Pherson was an overseer where slaves were employed in cutting canals The labor there is very severe The ground is often very boggy the negroes are up to the middle or much deeper in mud and water cutting away roots and baling out mud if they can keep their heads above water they work on They lodge in huts or as they are called camps made of shingles or boards They lie down in the mud which has adhered to them making a great fire to dry themselves to keep off the cold No bedding whatever is allowed them it is only by work done over his task that any of them can get a blanket They are paid nothing except for this overwork Their masters come once a month to receive the money for their labor then perhaps some few very good masters will give them each some others some a pound of tobacco and some nothing at all The food is more abundant than that of field slaves indeed it is the best allowance in America it consists of a peck of meal and six pounds of pork per week the pork is commonly not good it is damaged and is bought as cheap as possible at auction M'Pherson gave the same task to each slave of course the weak ones often failed to do it I have often seen him tie up persons and flog them in the morning only because they were unable to get the previous day's task done ' after they were flogged pork or beef brine was put on their bleeding backs to increase the pain he sitting by resting himself and seeing it done After being thus flogged and pickled the sufferers often remained tied up all day the feet just touching the ground the legs tied and pieces of wood put between the legs All the motion allowed was a slight turn of the neck Thus exposed and helpless the yellow flies and musquitoes in great numbers would settle on the bleeding and smarting back and put the sufferer to extreme torture This continued all day for they were not taken down till night Here is a short sentence of Aaron's in conclusion Good News and Glad Tidings and Great Joy He that is free in Christ is free indeed Then this is heaven I have often heard of heaven Behold here it is Broad is the road that leads to death and thousands walk together there but wisdom shows a narrow path with here and there a traveller 
CharlesBall,SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES A NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF CHARLES BALL A BLACK MAN WHO LIVED FORTY YEARS IN MARYLAND SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA AS A SLAVE UNDER VARIOUS MASTERS AND WAS ONE YEAR IN THE NAVY WITH COMMODORE BARNEY DURING THE LATE WAR CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE MANNERS AND USAGES OF THE PLANTERS AND SLAVEHOLDERS OF THE SOUTH-- A DESCRIPTION OF THE CONDITION AND TREATMENT OF THE SLAVES WITH OBSERVATIONS UPON THE STATE OF MORALS AMONGST THE COTTON PLANTERS AND THE PERILS AND SUFFERINGS OF A FUGITIVE SLAVE WHO TWICE ESCAPED FROM THE COTTON COUNTRY NEW YORK PUBLISHED BY JOHN S TAYLOR Brick Church Chapel verso ENTERED according to Act of Congress in the year BY JOHN S TAYLOR In the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the Southern DISTRICT OF NEW YORK HENRY LUDWIG PRINTER INTRODUCTION In giving a place in the CABINET OF FREEDOM to the ensuing narrative it is deemed proper to accompany it with some remarks The reader will be desirous to know how far it is entitled to his belief and the editors of the Cabinet are equally desirous that he should not be misled They have been furnished with the following certificate Lewistown Pa July th We the undersigned certify that we have read the book called 'CHARLES BALL'--that we know the black man whose narrative is given in this book and have heard him relate the principal matters contained in the book concerning himself long before the book was published DAVID W HOLINGS W P ELLIOTT This certificate establishes the fact that the subject of the narrative is not a fictitious personage Mr Fisher the author intimates in his preface what is indeed sufficiently obvious from the felicity of his style that the language of the book is not Mr Elliott is a justice of the peace and editor of the Lewistown Gazette Mr Holings is a lawyer and formerly a member of the Pennsylvania Legislature ii that of the unlettered slave whose adventures he records A similar intimation might with equal propriety have been given in reference to the various profound and interesting reflections interspersed throughout the work The author states in a private communication that many of the anecdotes in the book illustrative of southern society were not obtained from Ball but from other and creditable sources he avers however that all the facts which relate personally to the fugitive were received from his own lips How far this personal narrative is true is a question which each reader must of course decide for himself It is possible and not improbable that vanity may have induced the hero to exaggerate his exploits and that ignorance and forgetfulness may in some instances have rendered his tale discordant The hardships he encountered in his various attempts to escape from bondage are indeed extreme but are not for that reason incredible since it is difficult to estimate the amount of human suffering that can be voluntarily endured for an adequate object The account of his voyage from Savannah to Philadelphia strange as it is derives strong confirmation from the following still more extraordinary account taken from a New York journal The captain of a vessel from North Carolina called on the police for advisement respecting a slave he had unconsciously brought away in his vessel under the following curious circumstances Three or four days after he had got to sea he began iii to be haunted every hour with tones of distress seemingly proceeding from a human voice in the very lowest part of the vessel A particular scrutiny was finally instituted and it was concluded that the creature whatever and whoever it might be must be confined down in the run under the cabin floor and on boring a hole with an auger and demanding 'Who's there' a feeble voice responded 'Poor negro massa' It was clear enough then that some run-away negro had hid himself there before they sailed trusting to Providence for his ultimate escape Having discovered him however it was impossible to give him relief for the captain had stowed even the cabin so completely full of cotton as but just to leave room for a small table for himself and the mate to eat on and as for unloading at sea that was pretty much out of the question Accordingly there he had to lie stretched at full length for a tedious interval of thirteen days till the vessel arrived in port and unloaded receiving his food and drink through the auger hole The fellow's story is now he is released that being determined to get away from slavery he supplied himself with eggs and biscuit and some jugs of water which latter he was just on the point of depositing in his lurking place when he discovered the captain at a distance coming on board and had to hurry down as fast as possible and leave them That he lived on nothing but his eggs and biscuit till discovered by the captain not even getting a drop of water except what he had the good fortune iv to catch in his hand one day when a vessel of water in the cabin was upset during a squall and some of it ran down through the cracks of the floor over him--Commercial Advertiser With regard to the pictures given in this work of the internal Slave-trade and of the economy of a cotton plantation it may be observed that they are perfectly consistent not only with the various other representations which have from time to time been made by unimpeachable witnesses but also with the irresponsible despotism which is vested by law and custom in southern masters That despotism within the confines of a plantation is more absolute and irresistible than any that was ever wielded by a Roman emperor The power of the latter when no longer supportable was terminated by revolt or personal violence and often with impunity But to the despotism of the master there is scarcely any conceivable limit and from its cruelty there is no refuge His plantation is his empire his labourers are his subjects and revolt and violence instead of abridging his power are followed by inevitable and horrible punishment The laws of the land do not indeed authorize the master to take life but they do not forbid him to wear it out by excessive toil Public opinion sometimes exercises a more controlling influence than law and it may perhaps be supposed that it throws its shield before the helpless slave But it should be recollected that public opinion at the south is the opinion of the masters themselves and that they are individually amenable to it v chiefly in regard to their intercourse with each other as citizens and not in regard to the authority they exercise over their property In his negro quarters or his cotton field the planter is withdrawn from the gaze of his neighbours who have neither the right nor the disposition to scrutinize his conduct He is there an unquestioned despot and his vassals have no press to proclaim their wrongs no tribunal to petition for a redress of grievances and are prohibited from entering a Court of Justice as suitors or even as witnesses against any individual whose complexion is not coloured like their own Hence it follows that the master is virtually the arbiter of life and death All history and all our knowledge of human nature unite in bearing testimony to the hardening and corrupting influence of irresponsible power on its possessor Some indeed are shielded against this influence by natural benevolence or religious principle and it is creditable to Ball's candour that he mentions instances of kindness on the part of the masters--but such instances must necessarily from the very constitution of our nature be exceptions to the general rule The cruelty and detestable injustice of the slave code in all ages and in all countries conclusively establishes the general effect of slavery in paralyzing the moral sense Some readers may be disposed to doubt Ball's veracity on account of the atrocious cruelties he relates Such a doubt evinces a very imperfect acquaintance with southern feelings and manners The cruelties recorded in the narrative were practised by a few vi individuals but if assembled multitudes in the slave-states can publicly unite in perpetrating still greater atrocities then surely the story told by Ball is not incredible The following deeds of horror recounted by the public journals render tame and insignificant the acts of cruelty detailed in the work before us Tuscaloosa Alabama HORRID OCCURRENCE--Some time during the last week one of those outrageous transactions and we really think disgraceful to the character of civilized man took place near the north-east boundary line of Perry adjoining Bibb and Autauga counties The circumstances we are informed by a gentleman from that county are--that a Mr McNeilly having lost some clothing or other property of no great value the slave of a neighbouring planter was charged with the theft McNeilly in company with his brother found the negro driving his master's wagon--they seized him and either did or were about to chastise him when the negro stabbed McNeilly so that he died in an hour afterwards The negro was taken before a justice of the peace who after serious deliberation waived his authority perhaps through fear as the crowd of persons from the above counties had collected to the number of seventy or eighty men near Mr People's the justice house He acted as president of the mob and put the vote when it was decided he should be immediately executed by beingiBURNT TO DEATH vii The sable culprit was led to a tree and tied to it and a large quantity of pine knots collected and placed round him and the fatal torch applied to the pile even against the remonstrances of several gentlemen who were present and the miserable being was in a short time burnt to ashes This is the SECOND negro who has been THUS put to death without judge or jury in that county On the th of April a negro was burnt alive at St Louis by a numerous mob The Alton Telegraph gives the following particulars All was silent as death while the executioners were piling wood around the victim He not a word probably feeling that the flames had seized upon him He then uttered an awful howl attempting to sing and pray then hung his head and suffered in silence excepting in the following instance-- After the flames had surrounded their prey and when his clothes were in a blaze all over him his eyes burnt out of his head and his mouth seemingly parched to a cinder some one in the crowd more compassionate than the rest proposed to put an end to his misery by shooting him when it was replied 'that would be of no use since he was already out of pain' 'No no' the wretch 'I am not--I am suffering as much as ever--shoot me shoot me' 'No no' one of the fiends who was standing about the sacrifice they were roasting 'he shall not be shot I would sooner slacken the fire if that would increase his misery' and the viii man who this was we understand an officer of justice We understand says the New Orleans Post of June th that a negro man was lately condemned by the mob to be BURNED OVER A SLOW FIRE which was put into execution at Grand Gulf for murdering a black woman and her master Mr Green a respectable citizen of that place who attempted to save her from the clutches of this monster We have been informed says the Arkansas Gazette of the th October that the slave William who murdered his master Huskey some weeks since and several negroes was taken by a party a few days since from the Sheriff of Hot Springs and BURNED ALIVE yes tied up to to limb of a tree a fire built under him and consumed in slow and lingering torture It has been already observed that the master is virtually the arbiter of life and death How far the state of public opinion at the south confirms or contradicts this assertion may be seen from the annexed report of a suit brought to recover the value of a murdered slave If he who takes the life of another's slave is permitted to go at large without molestation after making compensation for the property destroyed who shall presume to punish the owner for doing what he will with his own From the Nashville Tennessee Banner June INTERESTING TRIAL--During the session of ix the circuit-court for Davison county which adjourned a few days since a case was tried of more than usual interest to the public It was that of Meeks against Philips for the value of a slave who had been killed by Philips whilst in the employment of Meeks as his overseer The following abstract of the evidence was furnished us by a disinterested member of the bar who was not engaged as counsel for either side of the cause 'It appeared in evidence that the negro had disobeyed Philips' orders in going away one night without his permission for which in accordance with his duty he undertook to chastise him The boy proved somewhat refractory and probably offered resistance though there was no direct evidence of the fact From Philip's admissions which must be taken for as well as against him it seems he had a scuffle with the boy during which the boy inflicted a blow upon him which produced great pain Philips with assistance finally subdued him While endeavouring to swing him to the limb of a tree he resisted by pulling back whereupon Philips who is a large and strong man gave him several blows upon his head with the butt of a loaded horsewhip Having tied him to the limb the rope gave way and the boy fell to the ground when Philips gave him several violent kicks in the side and again swung him to the tree He then called for a cow-hide which was accordingly brought arid the chastisement was commenced anew The suffering wretch implored for x mercy in vain Phili s would whip him awhile and then rest only to renew his strokes and wreak his vengeance for he repeatedly avowed his intention of whipping him to death--saying he had as good a negro to put in his room or remunerate his master for the loss of him The sufferer writhing under the stinging tortures of the lash continued to implore for mercy while those who were present interposed and pleaded too in his behalf but there was no relenting arm until life was nearly extinct and feeling had taken its departure He was cut loose bleeding and weak overcome with extreme exhaustion and debility and died in a few minutes after' The jury of course found for the plaintiff xi PREFACE IN the following s the reader will find embodied the principal incidents that have occurred in the life of a slave in the United States of America The narrative is taken from the mouth of the adventurer himself and if the copy does not retain the identical words of the original the sense and import at least are faithfully preserved Many of his opinions have been cautiously omitted or carefully suppressed as being of no value to the reader and his sentiments upon the subject of slavery have not been embodied in this work The design of the writer who is no more than the recorder of the facts detailed to him by another has been to render the narrative as simple and the style of the story as plain as the laws of the language would permit To introduce the reader as it were to a view of the cotton fields and exhibit not to his imagination but to his very eyes the mode of life to which the slaves on the southern plantations must conform has been the primary object of the compiler The book has been written without fear or prejudice and no opinions have been consulted in its composition The sole view of the writer has been to make the citizens of the United States acquainted with each other and to give a faithful portrait of the manners usages and customs of the southern people so far as those manners usages and customs xii have fallen under the observations of a common negro slave endued by nature with a tolerable portion of intellectual capacity The more reliance is to be placed upon his relations of those things that he saw in the southern country when it is recollected that he had been born and brought up in a part of the state of Maryland in which of all others the spirit of the old aristocracy as it has not unaptly been called retained much of its pristine vigour in his youth and where he had an early opportunity of seeing many of the most respectable best educated and most highly enlightened families of both Maryland and Virginia a constant succession of kind offices friendly visits and family alliances having at that day united the most distinguished inhabitants of the two sides of the Potomac in the social relations of one people It might naturally be expected that a man who had passed through so many scenes of adversity and had suffered so many wrongs at the hands of his fellow-man would feel much of the bitterness of heart that is engendered by a remembrance of unatoned injuries but every sentiment of this kind has been carefully excluded from the following s in which the reader will find nothing but an unadorned detail of acts and the impressions those acts produced on the mind of him upon whom they operated NARRATIVE I THE system of slavery as practised in the United States has been and is now but little understood by the people who live north of the Potomac and the Ohio for although individual cases of extreme cruelty and oppression occasionally occur in Maryland yet the general treatment of the black people is far more lenient and mild in that state than it is farther south This I presume is mainly to be attributed to the vicinity of the free state of Pennsylvania but in no small degree to the influence of the population of the cities of Baltimore and Washington over the families of the planters of the surrounding counties For experience has taught me that both masters and mistresses who if not observed by strangers would treat their slaves with the utmost rigour are so far operated upon by a sense of shame or pride as to provide them tolerably with both food and clothing when they know their conduct is subject to the observation of persons whose good opinion they wish to preserve A large number of the most respectable and wealthy people in both Washington and Baltimore being altogether opposed to the practice of slavery hold a constant control over the actions of their friends the farmers and thus prevent much misery but in the south the case is widely different There every man and every woman too except prevented by poverty is a slave-holder and the entire white population is leagued together by a common bond of the most sordid interest in the torture and oppression of the poor descendants of Africa If the negro is wronged there is no one to whom he can complain-- if suffering for want of the coarsest food he dare not steal--if flogged till the flesh falls from his bones he must not murmur--and if compelled to perform his daily toil in an iron collar no expression of resentment must escape his lips People of the northern states who make excursions to the south visit the principal cities and towns travel the most frequented highways or even sojourn for a time at the residences of the large planters and partake of their hospitality and amusements know nothing of the condition of the southern slaves To acquire this knowledge the traveller must take up his abode for a season in the lodge of the overseer pass a summer in the remote cotton fields or spend a year within view of the rice swamps By attending for one month the court which the overseer of a large estate holds every evening in the cotton-gin yard and witnessing the execution of his decrees a Turk or a Russian would find the tribunals of his country far outdone It seems to be a law of nature that slavery is equally destructive to the master and the slave for whilst it stupifies the latter with fear and reduces him below the condition of man it brutalizes the former by the practice of continual tyranny and makes him the prey of all the vices which render human nature loathsome In the following simple narrative of an unlearned man I have endeavoured faithfully and truly to present to the reader some of the most material accidents which occurred to myself in a period of thirty years of slavery in the free Republic of the United States as well as many circumstances which I observed in the condition and conduct of other persons during that period It has been supposed by many that the state of the southern slaves is constantly becoming better and that the treatment which they receive at the hands of their masters is progressively milder and more humane but the contrary of all this is unquestionably the truth for under the bad culture which is practised in the south the land is constantly becoming poorer and the means of getting food more and more difficult So long as the land is new and rich and produces corn and sweet potatoes abundantly the black people seldom suffer greatly for food but when the ground is all cleared and planted in rice or cotton corn and potatoes become scarce and when corn has to be bought on a cotton plantation the people must expect to make acquaintance with hunger My grandfather was brought from Africa and sold as a slave in Calvert county in Maryland about the year I never understood the name of the ship in which he was imported nor the name of the planter who bought him on his arrival but at the time I knew him he was a slave in a family called Mauel who resided near Leonardtown My father was a slave in a family named Hantz living near the same place My mother was the slave of a tobacco planter an old man who died according to the best of my recollection when I was about four years old leaving his property in such a situation that it became necessary as I suppose to sell a part of it to pay his debts Soon after his death several of his slaves and with others myself were sold at public vendue My mother had several children my brothers and sisters and we were all sold on the same day to different purchasers Our new master took us away and I never saw my mother nor any of my brothers and sisters afterwards This was I presume about the year I learned subsequently from my father that my mother was sold to a Georgia trader who soon after that carried her away from Maryland Her other children were sold to slave-dealers from Carolina and were also taken away so that I was left alone in Calvert county with my father whose owner lived only a few miles from my new master's residence At the time I was sold I was quite naked having never had any clothes in my life but my new master had brought with him a child's frock or wrapper belonging to one of his own children and after he had purchased me he dressed me in this garment took me before him on his horse and started home but my poor mother when she saw me leaving her for the last time ran after me took me down from the horse clasped me in her arms and wept loudly and bitterly over me My master seemed to pity her and endeavoured to soothe her distress by telling her that he would be a good master to me and that I should not want any thing She then still holding me in her arms walked along the road beside the horse as he moved slowly and earnestly and imploringly besought my master to buy her and the rest of her children and not permit them to be carried away by the negro buyers but whilst thus entreating him to save her and her family the slave-driver who had first bought her came running in pursuit of her with a raw hide in his hand When he overtook us he told her he was her master now and ordered her to give that little negro to its owner and come back with him My mother then turned to him and cried Oh master do not take me from my child Without making any reply he gave her two or three heavy blows on the shoulders with his raw hide snatched me from her arms handed me to my master and seizing her by one arm dragged her back towards the place of sale My master then quickened the pace of his horse and as we advanced the cries of my poor parent became more and more indistinct-- at length they died away in the distance and I never again heard the voice of my poor mother Young as I was the horrors of that day sank deeply into my heart and even at this time though half a century has elapsed the terrors of the scene return with painful vividness upon my memory Frightened at the sight of the cruelties inflicted upon my poor mother I forgot my own sorrows at parting from her and clung to my new master as an angel and a saviour when compared with the hardened fiend into whose power she had fallen She had been a kind and good mother to me had warmed in her bosom in the cold nights of winter and had often divided the scanty pittance of food allowed her by her mistress between my brothers and sisters and me and gone supperless to bed herself Whatever victuals she could obtain beyond the coarse food salt fish and corn-bread allowed to slaves on the Patuxent and Potomac rivers she carefully distributed among her children and treated us with all the tenderness which her own miserable condition would permit I have no doubt that she was chained and driven to Carolina and toiled out the residue of a forlorn and famished existence in the rice swamps or indigo fields of the south My father never recovered from the effects of the shock which this sudden and overwhelming ruin of his family gave him He had formerly been of a gay social temper and when he came to see us on a Saturday night he always brought us some little present such as the means of a poor slave would allow--apples melons sweet potatoes or if he could procure nothing else a little parched corn which tasted better in our cabin because he had brought it He spent the greater part of the time which his master permitted him to pass with us in relating such stories as he had learned from his companions or in singing the rude songs common amongst the slaves of Maryland and Virginia After this time I never heard him laugh heartily or sing a song He became gloomy and morose in his temper to all but me and sp nt nearly all his leisure time with my grandfather who claimed kindred with some royal family in Africa and had been a great warrior in his native country The master of my father was a hard penurious man and so exceedingly avaricious that he scarcely allowed himself the common conveniences of life A stranger to sensibility he was incapable of tracing the change in the temper and deportment of my father to its true cause but attributed it to a sullen discontent with his condition as a slave and a desire to abandon his service and seek his liberty by escaping to some of the free states To prevent the perpetration of this suspected crime of running away from slavery the old man resolved to sell my father to a southern slave-dealer and accordingly applied to one of those men who was at that time in Calvert to become the purchaser The price was agreed on but as my father was a very strong active and resolute man it was deemed unsafe for the Georgian to attempt to seize him even with the aid of others in the day-time when he was at work as it was known he carried upon his person a large knife It was therefore determined to secure him by stratagem and for this purpose a farmer in the neighbourhood who was made privy to the plan alleged that he had lost a pig which must have been stolen by some one and that he suspected my father to be the thief A constable was employed to arrest him but as he was afraid to undertake the business alone he called on his way at the house of the master of my grandfather to procure assistance from the overseer of the plantation When he arrived at the house the overseer was at the barn and thither he repaired to make his application At the end of the barn was the coach-house and as the day was cool to avoid the wind which was high the two walked to the side of the coach-house to talk over the matter and settle their plan of operations It so happened that my grandfather whose business it was to keep the coach in good condition was at work at this time rubbing the plated handles of the doors and brightening the other metallic parts of the vehicle Hearing the voice of the overseer without he suspended his work and listening attentively became a party to their councils They agreed that they would delay the execution of their project until the next day as it was then late The supposed they would have no difficulty in apprehending their intended victim as knowing himself innocent of the theft he would readily consent to go with the constable to a justice of the peace to have the charge examined That night however about midnight my grandfather silently repaired to the cabin of my father a distance of about three miles aroused him from his sleep made him acquainted with the extent of his danger gave him a bottle of cider and a small bag of parched corn and then praying to the God of his native country to protect his son enjoined him to fly from the destruction which awaited him In the morning the Georgian could not find his newly purchased slave who was never seen or heard of in Maryland from that day He probably had prudence enough to conceal himself in the day and travel only at night by this means making his way slowly up the country between the Patapsco and Patuxent until he was able to strike across to the north and reach Pennsylvania After the flight of my father my grandfather was the only person left in Maryland with whom I could claim kindred He was at that time an old man as he himself nearly eighty years of age and he manifested towards me all the fondness which a person so far advanced in life could be expected to feel for a child As he was too feeble to perform much hard labour his master did not require him either to live or to work with the common field hands who were employed the greater part of the year in cultivating tobacco and preparing it for market that being the staple crop of all the lower part of the western shore of Maryland at that time Indeed old Ben as my grandfather was called had always expressed great contempt for his fellow slaves they being as he a mean and vulgar race quite beneath his rank and the dignity of his former station He had during all the time that I knew him a small cabin of his own with about half an acre of ground attached to it which he cultivated on his own account and from which he drew a large portion of his subsistence He entertained strange and peculiar notions of religion and prayed every night though he he ought to pray oftener but that his God would excuse him for the non-performance of this duty in consideration of his being a slave and compelled to devote his whole time to the service of his master He never went to church or meeting and held that the religion of this country was altogether false and indeed no religion at all being the mere invention of priests and crafty men who hoped thereby to profit through the ignorance and credulity of the multitude In support of this opinion he maintained that there could only be one true standard of faith which was the case in his country where all the people worshipped together in the same assembly and believed in the same doctrines which had been of old time delivered by the true God to a holy man who was taken up into heaven for that purpose and after he had received the divine communication had returned to earth and spent a hundred years in preaching and imparting the truth which had been revealed to him to mankind This inspired man resided in some country at a great distance from that of my grandfather but had come there across a part of the sea in company with an angel and instructed the people in the mysteries of the true faith which had ever since been preserved in its utmost purity by the descendants of those who received it through a period of more than ten thousand years My grandfather that the tenets of this religion were so plain and self-evident that any one could understand them without any other instruction than the reading of a small book a copy of which was kept in every family and which contained all the rules both of faith and practice necessary for any one to know or exercise No one was permitted to expound or explain this book as it was known to be the oracle of the true God and it was held impious for any person to give a construction to his words different from that which was so palpably and manifestly expressed on the face of the book This book was likewise written in such plain and intelligible language that only one meaning could possibly be given to any one part of it and was withal so compendious and brief that people could with very little labour commit the whole of its precepts to memory The priests had at several times attempted to publish commentaries and glossaries upon this book but as often as this had been attempted the perpetrators had been tried found guilty of conspiring to corrupt the public morals and then banished from the country People who were disposed to worship publicly convened together in summer under the boughs of a large tree and the eldest person present read the inspired book from beginning to end which could be done in two hours at most Sometimes a priest was employed to read the book but he was never by any means allowed to add any observations of his own as it would have been considered absurd as well as very wicked for a mere man to attempt to add to alter amend or in any manner give a colouring to the revealed word of God In winter when it rained constantly the worshippers met under the roof of a house covered with the leaves of a certain tree which grew in great abundance on the margins of all the streams The law imposed no penalties on those who did not profess to believe the contents of the sacred book but those who did not live according to its rules were deemed had subjects and were compelled to become soldiers as being fit only for a life of bloodshed and cruelty The book inculcated no particular form of belief and left men free to profess what faith they pleased but its principles of morality were extremely rigid and uncompromising Love of country charity and social affection were the chief points of duty enjoined by it Lying and drunkenness were strictly prohibited and those guilty of these vices were severely punished Cruelty was placed in the same rank of crimes but the mode of punishment was left entirely to the civil law-giver The book required neither fastings penances nor pilgrimages but tenderness to wives and children was one of its most positive injunctions II The name of the man who purchased me at the vendue and became my master was John Cox but he was generally called Jack Cox He was a man of kindly feelings towards his family and treated his slaves of whom he had several besides me with humanity He permitted my grandfather to visit me as often as he pleased and allowed him sometimes to carry me to his own cabin which stood in a lonely place at the head of a deep hollow almost surrounded by a thicket of cedar trees which had grown up in a worn out and abandoned tobacco field My master gave me better clothes than the little slaves of my age generally received in Calvert and often told me that he intended to make me his waiter and that if I behaved well I should become his overseer in time These stations of waiter and overseer appeared to me to be the highest points of honour and greatness in the whole world and had not circumstances frustrated my master's plans as well as my own views I should probably have been living at this time in a cabin on the corner of some tobacco plantation Fortune had decreed otherwise When I was about twelve years old my master Jack Cox died of a disease which had long confined him to the house I was sorry for the death of my master who had always been kind to me and I soon discovered that I had good cause to regret his departure from this world He had several children at the time of his death who were all young the oldest being about my own age The father of my late master who was still living became administrator of his estate and took possession of his property and amongst the rest of myself This old gentleman treated me with the greatest severity and compelled me to work very hard on his plantation for several years until I suppose I must have been near or quite twenty years of age As I was always very obedient and ready to execute all his orders I did not receive much whipping but suffered greatly for want of sufficient and proper food My master allowed his slaves a peck of corn each per week throughout the year and this we had to grind into meal in a hand mill for ourselves We had a tolerable supply of meat for a short time about the month of December when he killed his hogs After that season we had meat once a week unless bacon became scarce which very often happened in which case we had no meat at all However as we fortunately lived near both the Patuxent river and the Chesapeake Bay we had abundance of fish in the spring and as long as the fishing season continued After that period each slave received in addition to his allowance of corn one salt herring every day My master gave me one pair of shoes one pair of stockings one hat one jacket of coarse cloth two coarse shirts and two pair of trousers yearly He allowed me no other clothes In the winter time I often suffered very much from the cold as I had to drive the team of oxen which hauled the tobacco to market and frequently did not get home until late at night the distance being considerable and my cattle travelling very slow One Saturday evening when I came home from the corn field my master told me that he had hired me out for a year at the city of Washington and that I would have to live at the navy-yard On the new-year's-day following which happened about two weeks afterwards my master set forward for Washington on horseback and ordered me to accompany him on foot It was night when we arrived at the navy-yard and every thing appeared very strange to me I was told by a gentleman who had epaulets on his shoulders that I must go on board a large ship which lay in the river He at the same time told a boy to show me the way This ship proved to be the Congress frigate and I was told that I had been brought there to cook for the people belonging to her In the course of a few days the duties of my station became quite familiar to me and in the enjoyment of a profusion of excellent provisions I felt very happy I strove by all means to please the officers and gentlemen who came on board and in this I soon found my account One gave me a half-worn coat another an old shirt and a third a cast off waistcoat and pantaloons Some presented me with small sums of money and in this way I soon found myself well clothed and with more than a dollar in my pocket My duties though constant were not burthensome and I was permitted to spend Sunday afternoon in my own way I generally went up into the city to see the new and splendid buildings often walked as far as Georgetown and made many new acquaintances amongst the slaves and frequently saw large numbers of people of my colour chained together in long trains and driven off towards the south At that time the Slave-trade was not regarded with so much indignation and disgust as it is now It was a rare thing to hear of a person of colour running away and escaping altogether from his master my father being the only one within my knowledge who had before this time obtained his liberty in this manner in Calvert county and as before stated I never heard what became of him after his flight I remained on board the Congress and about the navy-yard two years and was quite satisfied with my lot until about three months before the expiration of this period when it so happened that a schooner loaded with iron and other materials for the use of the yard arrived from Philadelphia She came and lay close by the Congress to discharge her cargo and amongst her crew I observed a black man with whom in the course of a day or two I became acquainted He told me he was free and lived in Philadelphia where he kept a house of entertainment for sailors which he was attended to in his absence by his wife His description of Philadelphia and of the liberty enjoyed there by the black people so charmed my imagination that I determined to devise some plan of escaping from the Congress and making my way to the north I communicated my designs to my new friend who promised to give me his aid We agreed that the night before the schooner should sail I was to be concealed in the hold amongst a parcel of loose tobacco which he the captain had undertaken to carry to Philadelphia The sailing of the schooner was delayed longer than we expected and finally her captain purchased a cargo of flour in Georgetown and sailed for the West Indies Whilst I was anxiously awaiting some other opportunity of making my way to Philadelphia the idea of crossing the country to the western part of Pennsylvania never entered my mind new-year's-day came and with it came my old master from Calvert accompanied by a gentleman named Gibson to whom he he had sold me and to whom he delivered me over in the navy-yard We all three set out that same evening for Calvert and reached the residence of my new master the next day Here I was informed that I had become the subject of a law-suit My new master claimed me under his purchase from old Mr Cox and another gentleman of the neighbourhood named Levin Ballard had bought me of the children of my former master Jack Cox This suit continued in the courts of Calvert county more than two years but was finally decided in favour of him who had bought me of the children I went home with my master Mr Gibson who was a farmer and with whom I lived three years Soon after I came to live with Mr Gibson I married a girl of colour named Judah the slave of a gentleman by the name of Symmes who resided in the same neighbourhood I was at the house of Mr Symmes every week and became as well acquainted with him and his family as I was with my master Mr Symmes also married a wife about the time I did The lady whom he married lived near Philadelphia and when she first came to Maryland she refused to be served by a black chambermaid but employed a white girl the daughter of a poor man who lived near The lady was reported to be very wealthy and brought a large trunk full of plate and other valuable articles This trunk was so heavy that I could scarcely carry it and it impressed my mind with the idea of great riches in the owner at that time After some time Mrs Symmes dismissed her white chambermaid and placed my wife in that situation which I regarded as a fortunate circumstance as it insured her good food and at least one good suit of clothes The Symmes' family was one of the most ancient in Maryland and had been a long time resident in Calvert county The grounds had been laid out and all the improvements projected about the family abode in a style of much magnificence according to the custom of the old aristocracy of Maryland and Virginia Appendant to the domicile and at no great distance from the house was a family vault built of brick in which reposed the occupants of the estate who had lived there for many previous generations This vault had not been opened or entered for fifteen years previous to the time of which I speak but it so happened that at this period a young man a distant relation of the family died having requested on his death-bed that he might be buried in this family resting place When I came on Saturday evening to see my wife and child Mr Symmes desired me as I was older than any of his black men to take an iron pick and go and open the vault which I accordingly did by cutting away the mortar and removing a few bricks from one side of the building but I could not remove more than three or four bricks before I was obliged by the horrid effluvia which issued at the aperture to retire It was the most deadly and sickening scent that I have ever smelled and I could not return to complete the work until after the sun had risen the next day when I pulled down so much of one of the side walls as to permit persons to walk in upright I then went in alone and examined this house of the dead and surely no picture could more strongly and vividly depict the emptiness of all earthly vanity and the nothingness of human pride Dispersed over the floor lay the fragments of more than twenty human skeletons each in the place where it had been deposited by the idle tenderness of surviving friends In some cases nothing remained but the hair and the larger bones whilst in several the form of the coffin was yet visible with all the bones resting in their proper places One coffin the sides of which were yet standing the lid only having decayed and partly fallen in so as to disclose the contents of this narrow cell presented a peculiarly moving spectacle Upon the centre of the lid was a large silver plate and the head and foot were adorned with silver stars The nails which had united the parts of the coffin had also silver heads Within lay the skeletons of a mother and her infant child in slumbers only to be broken by the peal of the last trumpet The bones of the infant lay upon the breast of the mother where the hands of affection had shrouded them The ribs of the parent had fallen down and rested on the back bone Many gold rings were about the bones of the fingers Brilliant ear-rings lay beneath where the ears had been and a glittering gold chain encircled the ghastly and haggard vertebrae of a once beautiful neck The shroud and flesh had disappeared but the hair of the mother appeared strong and fresh Even the silken locks of the infant were still preserved Behold the end of youth and beauty and of all that is lovely in life The coffin was so much decayed that it could not be removed A thick and dismal vapour hung embodied from the roof and walls of this charnal house in appearance somewhat like a mass of dark cobwebs but which was impalpable to the touch and when stirred by the hand vanished away On the second day we deposited with his kindred the corpse of the young man and at night I again carefully closed up the breach which I had made in the walls of this dwelling-place of the dead III Some short time after my wife became chambermaid to her mistress it was my misfortune to change masters once more Levin Ballard who as before stated had purchased me of the children of my former master Jack Cox was successful in his law suit with Mr Gibson the object of which was to determine the right of property in me and one day whilst I was at work in the corn-field Mr Ballard came and told me I was his property asking me at the same time if I was willing to go with him I told him I was not willing to go but that if I belonged to him I knew I must We then went to the house and Mr Gibson not being at home Mrs Gibson told me I must go with Mr Ballard I accordingly went with him determining to serve him obediently and faithfully I remained in his service almost three years and as he lived near the residence of my wife's master my former mode of life was not materially changed by this change of home Mrs Symmes spent much of her time in exchanging visits with the families of the other large planters both in Calvert and the neighbouring counties and through my wife I became acquainted with the private family history of many of the principal persons in Maryland There was a great proprietor who resided in another county who owned several hundred slaves and who permitted them to beg of travellers on the high-way This same gentleman had several daughters and according to the custom of the time kept what they called open house that is his house was free to all persons of genteel appearance who chose to visit it The young ladies were supposed to be the greatest fortunes in the country were reputed beautiful and consequently were greatly admired Two gentlemen who were lovers of these girls desirous of amusing their mistresses invited a young man whose standing in society they supposed to be beneath theirs to go with them to the manor as it was called When there they endeavoured to make him an object of ridicule in presence of the ladies but he so well acquitted himself and manifested such superior wit and talents that one of the young ladies fell in love with him and soon after wrote him a letter which led to their marriage His two pretended friends were never afterwards countenanced by the family as gentlemen of honour but the fortunate husband avenged himself of his heartless companions by inviting them to his wedding and exposing them to the observation of the vast assemblage of fashionable people who always attended a marriage in the family of a great planter The two gentlemen who had been thus made to fall into the pit that they had dug for another were so much chagrined at the issue of the adventure that one soon left Maryland and the other became a common drunkard and died a few years afterwards My change of masters realised all the evil apprehensions which I had entertained I found Mr Ballard sullen and crabbed in his temper and always prone to find fault with my conduct--no matter how hard I had laboured or how careful I was to fulfil all his orders and obey his most unreasonable commands Yet it so happened that he never beat me for which I was altogether indebted to the good character for inus try sobriety and humility which I had established in the neighbourhood I think he was ashamed to abuse me lest he should suffer in the good opinion of the public for he often fell into the most violent fits of anger against me and overwhelmed me with coarse and abusive language He did not give me clothes enough to keep me warm in winter and compelled me to work in the woods when there was deep snow on the ground by which I suffered very much I had determined at last to speak to him to sell me to some person in the neighbourbood so that I might still be near my wife and children--but a different fate awaited me My master kept a store at a small village on the bank of the Patuxent river called B---- although he resided at some distance on a farm One morning he rose early and ordered me to take a yoke of oxen and go to the village to bring home a cart which was there saying he would follow me He arrived at the village soon after I did and took his breakfast with his store-keeper He then told me to come into the house and get my breakfast Whilst I was eating in the kitchen I observed him talking earnestly but lowly to a stranger near the kitchen door I soon after went out and hitched my oxen to the cart and was about to drive off when several men came round about me and amongst them the stranger whom I had seen speaking with my master This man came up to me and seizing me by the collar shook me violently saying I was his property and must go with him to Georgia At the sound of these words the thoughts of my wife and children rushed across my mind and my heart died away within me I saw and knew that my case was hopeless and that resistance was vain as there were near twenty persons present all of whom were ready to assist the man by whom I was kidnapped I felt incapable of weeping or speaking and in my despair I laughed loudly My purchaser ordered me to cross my hands behind which were quickly bound with a strong cord and he then told me that we must set out that very day for the south I asked if I could not be allowed to go to see my wife and children or if this could not be permitted if they might not have leave to come to see me but was told that I would be able to get another wife in Georgia My new master whose name I did not hear took me that same day across the Patuxent where I joined fifty-one other slaves whom he had bought in Maryland Thirty-two of these were men and nineteen were women The women were merely tied together with a rope about the size of a bed cord which was tied like a halter round the neck of each but the men of whom I was the stoutest and strongest were very differently caparisoned A strong iron collar was closely fitted by means of a padlock round each of our necks A chain of iron about a hundred feet in length was passed through the hasp of each padlock except at the two ends where the hasps of the padlocks passed through a link of the chain In addition to this we were handcuffed in pairs with iron staples and bolts with a short chain about a foot long uniting the handcuffs and their wearers in pairs In this manner we were chained alternately by the right and left hand and the poor man to whom I was thus ironed wept like all infant when the blacksmith with his heavy hammer fastened the ends of the bolts that kept the staples from slipping from our arms For my own part I felt indifferent to my fate It appeared to me that the worst had come that could come and that no change of fortune could harm me After we were all chained and handcuffed together we sat down upon the ground and here reflecting upon the sad reverse of fortune that had so suddenly overtaken me and the dreadful suffering which awaited me I became weary of life and bitterly execrated the day I was born It seemed that I was destined by fate to drink the cup of sorrow to the very dregs and that I should find no respite from misery but in the grave I longed to die and escape from the hands of my tormentors but even the wretched privilege of destroying myself was denied me for I could not shake off my chains nor move a yard without the consent of my master Reflecting in silence upon my forlorn condition I at length concluded that as things could not become worse--and as the life of man is but a continued round of changes they must of necessity take a turn in my favour at some future day I found relief in this vague and indefinite hope and when we received orders to go on board the scow which was to transport us over the Patuxent I marched down to the water with a firmness of purpose of which I did not believe myself capable a few minutes before We were soon on the south side of the river and taking up our line of march we travelled about five miles that evening and stopped for the night at one of those miserable public houses so frequent in the lower parts of Maryland and Virginia called ordinaries Our master ordered a pot of mush to be made for our supper after despatching which we all lay down on the naked floor to steep in our handcuffs and chains The women my fellow-slaves lay on one side of the room and the men who were chained with me occupied the other I slept but little this night which I passed in thinking of my wife and little children whom I could not hope ever to see again I also thought of my grandfather and of the long nights I had passed with him listening to his narratives of the scenes through which he had passed in Africa I at length fell asleep but was distressed by painful dreams My wife and children appeared to be weeping and lamenting my calamity and beseeching and imploring my master on their knees not to carry me away from them My little boy came and begged me not to go and leave him and endeavoured as I thought with his little hands to break the fetters that bound me I awoke in agony and cursed my existence I could not pray for the measure of my woes seemed to be full and I felt as if there was no mercy in heaven nor compassion on earth for a man who was born a slave Day at length came and with the dawn we resumed our journey towards the Potomac As we passed along the road I saw the slaves at work in the corn and tobacco-fields I knew they toiled hard and lacked food but they were not like me dragged in chains from their wives children and friends Compared with me they were the happiest of mortals I almost envied them their blessed lot Before night we crossed the Potomac at Hoe's Ferry and bade farewell to Maryland At night we stopped at the house of a poor gentleman at least he appeared to wish my master to consider him a gentleman and he had no difficulty in establishing his claim to poverty He lived at the side of the road in a framed house which had never been plastered within--the weather-boards being the only wall He had about fifty acres of land enclosed by a fence the remains of a farm which had once covered two or three hundred acres but the cedar bushes had encroached upon all sides until the cultivation had been confined to its present limits The land was the very picture of sterility and there was neither barn nor stable on the place The owner was ragged and his wife and children were in a similar plight It was with difficulty that we obtained a bushel of corn which our master ordered us to parch at a fire made in the yard and to eat for our supper Even this miserable family possessed two slaves half-starved half-naked wretches whose appearance bespoke them familiar with hunger and victims of the lash but yet there was one pang which they had not known--they had not been chained and driven from their parents or children into hopeless exile We left this place early in the morning and directed our course toward the south-west our master riding beside us and hastening our march sometimes by words of encouragement and sometimes by threats of punishment The women took their place in the rear of our line We halted about nine o'clock for breakfast and received as much cornbread as we could eat together with a plate of broiled herrings and about three pounds of pork amongst us Before we left this place I was removed from near the middle of the chain and placed at the front end of it so that I now became the leader of the file and held this post of honour until our irons were taken from us near the town of Columbia in South Carolina We continued our route this day along the high road between the Potomac and Rappahannock and I several times saw each of those rivers before night Our master gave us no dinner to day but we halted a short time before sundown and got as much corn mush and sour milk as we could eat for supper It was now the beginning of the month of May and the weather in the fine climate of Virginia was very mild and pleasant so that our master was not obliged to provide us with fire at night From this time to the end of our journey southward we all slept promiscuously men and women on the floors of such houses as we chanced to stop at We had no clothes except those we wore and a few blankets the larger portion of our gang being in rags at the time we crossed the Potomac Two of the women were pregnant the one far advanced-- and she already complained of inability to keep pace with our march but her complaints were disregarded We crossed the Rappahannock at Port Royal and afterwards passed through the village of Bowling Green a place with which I became better acquainted in after times but which now presented the quiet so common to all the small towns in Virginia and indeed in all the southern states Time did not reconcile me to my chains but it made me familiar with them and in a few days the horrible sensations attendant upon my cruel separation from my wife and children in some measure subsided and I began to reflect upon my present hopeless and desperate situation with some degree of calmness hoping that I might be able to devise some means of escaping from the hands of my new master who seemed to place particular value on me as I could perceive from his conversation with such persons as we happened to meet at our resting places I heard him tell a tavern-keeper where we halted that if he had me in Georgia he could get five hundred dollars for me but he had bought me for his brother and he believed he would not sell me but in this he afterwards changed his opinion I examined every part of our long chain to see if there might not be some place in it at which it could be severed but found it so completely secured that with any means in my power its separation was impossible From this time I endeavoured to beguile my sorrows by examining the state of the country through which we were travelling and observing the condition of my fellow-slaves on the plantations along the high-road upon which we sojourned We all had as much corn bread as we could eat This was procured by our owner at the small dram shops or ordinaries at which we usually tarried all night In addition to this we generally received a salt herring though not every day On Sunday our master bought as much bacon as when divided amongst us gave about a quarter of a pound to each person in our gang In Calvert county where I was born the practice amongst slave-holders was to allow each slave one peck of corn weekly which was measured out every Monday morning at the same time each one receiving seven salt herrings This formed the week's provision and the master who did not give it was called a hard master whilst those who allowed their people any thing more were deemed kind and indulgent It often happened that the stock of salt herrings laid up by a master in the spring was not sufficient to enable him to continue this rate of distribution through the year and when the fish failed nothing more than the corn was dealt out On the other hand some planters who had large stocks of cattle and many cows kept the sour milk after all the cream had been skimmed from it and made a daily distribution of this amongst the working slaves Some who had large apple orchards gave their slaves a pint of cider each per day through the autumn It sometimes happened too in the lower counties of Maryland that there was an allowance of pork made to the slaves one day in each week though on some estates this did not take place more than once in a month This allowance of meat was disposed of in such a manner as to permit each slave to get a slice very often amounting to half a pound The slaves were also permitted to work for themselves at night and on Sunday If they chose to fish they had the privilege of selling whatever they caught Some expert fishermen caught and sold as many fish and oysters as enabled them to buy coffee sugar and other luxuries for their wives besides keeping themselves and their families in Sunday clothes for the masters in Maryland only allowed the men one wool hat one pair of shoes two shirts two pair of trousers-- one pair of tow cloth and one of woollen--and one woollen jacket in the year The women were furnished in proportion All other clothes they had to provide for themselves Children not able to work in the field were not provided with clothes at all by their masters It is however honourable to the Maryland slave-holders that they never permit women to go naked in the fields or about the house and if the men are industrious and employ themselves well on Sundays and holydays they can always keep themselves in comfortable clothes In Virginia it appeared to me that the slaves were more rigorously treated than they were in my native place It is easy to tell a man of colour who is poorly fed from one who is well supplied with food by his personal appearance A half-starved negro is a miserable looking creature His skin becomes dry and appears to be sprinkled over with whitish husks or scales the glossiness of his face vanishes his hair loses its colour becomes dry and when stricken with a rod the dust flies from it These signs of bad treatment I perceived to be very common in Virginia many young girls who would have been beautiful if they had been allowed enough to eat had lost all their prettiness through mere starvation their fine glossy hair had become of a reddish colour and stood out round their heads like long brown wool IV Our master at first expressed a determination to pass through the city of Richmond but for some reason which he did not make known to us he changed his mind and drove us up the country crossing the Matepony North Anna and South Anna rivers For several days we traversed a region which had been deserted by the occupants--being no longer worth culture--and immense thickets of young red cedars now occupied the fields in digging of which thousands of wretched slaves had worn out their lives in the service of merciless masters In some places these cedar thickets as they are called continued for three or four miles together without a house to enliven the scene and with scarcely an original forest tree to give variety to the landscape One day in the midst of a wilderness of cedars we came in view of a stately and venerable looking brick edifice which on nearer inspection I discovered to be a church On approaching it our driver ordered us to halt and dismounting from his horse tied him to a young cedar tree and sat himself down upon a flat tomb-stone near the west end of the church ordering us at the same time to sit down among the grass and rest ourselves The grave yard in which we were now encamped occupied about two acres of ground which was surrounded by a square brick wall much dilapidated and in many places broken down nearly to the ground The gates were decayed and gone but the gate-ways were yet distinct The whole enclosure was thickly strewed with graves many of which were surmounted by beautiful marble slabs others were designated by plain head and foot stones whilst far the larger number only betrayed the resting places of their sleeping tenant by the simple mounds of clay which still maintained their elevation above the level of the surrounding earth From the appearance of this burial place I suppose no one had been interred there for thirty years Several hollies planted by the hands of friendship grew amongst the hillocks and numerous flowering shrubs and bushes now in bloom gave fragrance to the air of the place The cedars which covered the surrounding plain with a forest impervious to the eye had respected this lonely dwelling of the dead and not one was to be seen within the walls Though it was now the meridian of day in spring the stillness of midnight pervaded the environs of this deserted and forsaken temple the pulpit pews and gallery of which were still standing as I could perceive through the broken door-way and maintained a freshness and newness of appearance little according with the time-worn aspect of the exterior scenery It was manifest that this earthly dwelling of the Most High now so desolate and ruinous was once the resort of a congregation of people gay fashionable and proud who had disappeared from the land leaving only this fallen edifice and these grassy tombs as the mementos of their existence They had passed away even as did the wandering red men who roamed through the lofty oak forests which once shaded the ground where we now lay As I sat musing upon the desolation that surrounded me my mind turned to the cause which had converted a former rich and populous country into the solitude of a deserted wilderness The ground over which we had travelled since we crossed the Potomac had generally been a strong reddish clay with an admixture of sand and was of the same quality with the soil of the counties of Chester Montgomery and Bucks in Pennsylvania It had originally been highly fertile and productive and had it been properly treated would doubtlessly have continued to yield abundant and prolific crops but the gentlemen who became the early proprietors of this fine region supplied themselves with slaves from Africa cleared large plantations of many thousands of acres--cultivated tobacco--and became suddenly wealthy built spacious houses and numerous churches such as this but regardless of their true interest they valued their lands less than their slaves exhausted the kindly soil by unremitting crops of tobacco declined in their circumstances and finally grew poor upon the very fields that had formerly made their possessors rich abandoned one portion after another as not worth planting any longer and pinched by necessity at last sold their slaves to Georgian planters to procure a subsistence and when all was gone took refuge in the wilds of Kentucky again to act the same melancholy drama leaving their native land to desolation and poverty The churches then followed the fate of their builders The revolutionary war deprived the parsons of their legal support and they fled from the altar which no longer maintained them Virginia has become poor by the folly and wickedness of slavery and dearly has she paid for the anguish and sufferings she has inflicted upon our injured degraded and fallen race After remaining about two hours in this place we again resumed our march and wretched as I was I felt relieved when we departed from this abode of the spirit of ruin We continued our course up the country westward for two or three days moving at a slow pace and at length turning south crossed James river at a place about thirty miles above Richmond as I understood at the time We continued our journey from day to day in a course and by roads which appeared to me to bear generally about south-west for more than four weeks in which time we entered South Carolina and in this state near Camden I first saw a field of cotton in bloom I had endeavoured through the whole journey from the time we crossed the Rappahannock river to make such observations upon the country the roads we travelled and the towns we passed through as would enable me at some future period to find my way back to Maryland I was particularly careful to note the names of the towns and villages through which we passed and to fix on my memory not only the names of all the rivers but also the position and bearing of the ferries over those streams After leaving James river I assumed an air of cheerfulness and even gaiety--I often told stories to my master of the manners and customs of the Maryland planters and asked him if the same usages prevailed in Georgia whither we were destined By repeatedly naming the rivers that we came to and in the order which we had reached them I was able at my arrival in Georgia to repeat the name of every considerable stream from the Potomac to the Savannah and to tell at what ferries we had crossed them I afterwards found this knowledge of great service to me indeed without it I should never have been able to extricate myself from slavery After leaving James river our road led us southwest through that region of country which in Virginia and the Carolinas they call the upper country It lies between the head of the tides in the great rivers and the lower ranges of the Alleghany Mountains I had at that time never seen a country cultivated by the labour of freemen and consequently was not able to institute any comparison between the southern plantations and the farms in Pennsylvania the fields of which are ploughed and reaped by the hands of their owners but my recollection of the general aspect of upper Virginia and Carolina is still vivid When contrasted with the exhausted and depopulated portion of Virginia lying below the head of the tide much of which I had seen the lands traversed by us in the month of May and early part of June were indeed fertile and beautiful but when compared with what the same plantations would have been in the hands of such farmers as I have seen in Pennsylvania divided into farms of the proper size the cause of the general poverty and weakness of the slave-holding states is at once seen The plantations are large in the south often including a thousand acres or more the population is consequently thin as only one white family beside the overseer ever resides on one plantation As I advanced southward even in Virginia I perceived that the state of cultivation became progressively worse Here as in Maryland the practice of the best farmers who cultivate grain of planting the land every alternate year in corn and sowing it in wheat or rye in the autumn of the same year in which the corn is planted and whilst the corn is yet standing in the field so as to get a crop from the same ground every year without allowing it time to rest or recover exhausts the finest soil in a few years and in one or two generations reduces the proprietors to poverty Some who are supposed to be very superior farmers only plant the land in corn once in three years sowing it in wheat or rye as in the former case however without any covering of clover or other grass to protect it from the rays of the sun The culture of tobacco prevails over a large portion of Virginia especially south of James river to the exclusion of almost every other crop except corn This destructive crop ruins the best land in a short time and in all the lower parts of Maryland and Virginia the traveller will see large old family mansions of weather-beaten and neglected appearance standing in the middle of vast fields of many hundred acres the fences of which have rotted away and have been replaced by a wattled work in place of a fence composed of short cedar stakes driven into the ground about two feet apart and standing about three feet above the earth the intervals being filled up by branches cut from the cedar trees and worked into the stakes horizontally after the manner of splits in a basket Many of these fields have been abandoned altogether and are overgrown by cedars which spring up in infinite numbers almost as soon as a field ceases to be ploughed and furnish materials for fencing such parts of the ancient plantation as are still kept enclosed In many places the enclosed fields are only partially cultivated all the hills and poorest parts being given up to the cedars and chinquopin bushes These estates the seats of families that were once powerful wealthy and proud are universally destitute of the appearance of a barn such as is known among the farmers of Pennsylvania The out houses stables gardens and offices have fallen to decay and the dwelling-house is occupied by the descendants of those who erected it still pertinaciously adhering to the halls of their ancestry with a half dozen or ten slaves the remains of the two or three hundred who toiled upon these grounds in former days The residue of the stock has been distributed in marriage portions to the daughters of the family gone to a distance--have been removed to the west by emigrating sons or have been sold to the southern traders from time to time to procure money to support the dignity of the house as the land grew poorer and the tobacco crop shorter from year to year Industry enterprise and ambition have fled from these abodes and sought refuge from sterility and barrenness in the vales of Kentucky or the plains of Alabama whilst the present occupants vain of their ancestral monuments and proud of an obscure name contend with all the ills that poverty brings upon fallen greatness and pass their lives in a contest between mimic state and actual penury--too ignorant of agriculture to know how to restore fertility to a once prolific and still substantial soil and too spiritless to sell their effects and search a new home under other skies The sedge grass every where takes possession of the worn out fields until it is supplanted by the chinquopin and the cedar This grass grows in thick set bunches or stools and no land is too poor for it It rises to the height of two or three feet and grows in many places in great profusion--is utterly worthless either for hay or pasturage but affords shelter to numerous rabbits and countless flocks of partridges and at a short distance has a beautiful appearance as its elastic blue tops wave in the breeze In Maryland and Virginia although the slaves are treated with so much rigour and oftentimes with so much cruelty I have seen instances of the greatest tenderness of feeling on the part of their owners I myself had three masters in Maryland and I cannot say now even after having resided so many years in a state where slavery is not tolerated that either of them except the last who sold me to the Georgians and was an unfeeling man used me worse than they had a moral right to do regarding me merely as an article of property and not entitled to any rights as a man political or civil My mistresses in Maryland were all good women and the mistress of my wife in whose kitchen I spent my Sundays and many of my nights for several years was a lady of most benevolent and kindly feelings She was a true friend to me and I shall always venerate her memory It is now my opinion after all I have seen that there are no better-hearted women in the world than the ladies of the ancient families as they are called in old Virginia or the country below the mountains and the same observations will apply to the ladies of Maryland The stock of slaves has belonged to the family for several generations and there is a kind of family pride in being the proprietors of so many human beings which in many instances borders on affection for people of colour If the proprietors of the soil in Maryland and Virginia were skilful cultivators--had their lands in good condition--and kept no more slaves on each estate than would be sufficient to work the soil in a proper manner and keep up the repairs of the place--the condition of the coloured people would not be by any means a comparatively unhappy one I am convinced that in nine cases in ten the hardships and sufferings of the coloured population of lower Virginia is attributable to the poverty and distress of its owners In many instances an estate scarcely yields enough to feed and clothe the slaves in a comfortable manner without allowing any thing for the support of the master and family but it is obvious that the family must first be supported and the slaves must be content with the surplus-- and this on a poor old worn out tobacco plantation is often very small and wholly inadequate to the comfortable sustenance of the hands as they are called There in many places nothing is allowed to the poor negro but his peck of corn per week without the sauce of a salt herring or even a little salt itself Wretched as may be the state of the negroes in the quarter that of the master and his wife and daughters is in many instances not much more enviable in the old apartments of the great house The sons and daughters of the family are gentlemen and ladies by birthright--and were the former to be seen at the plough or the latter at the churn or the wash tub the honour of the family would be stained and the dignity of the house degraded People must and will be employed about something and if they cannot be usefully occupied they will most surely engage in some pursuit wholly unprofitable So it happens in Virginia--the young men spend their time in riding about the country whilst they ought to be ploughing or harrowing in the cornfield and the young women are engaged in reading silly books or visiting their neighbours' houses instead of attending to the dairy or manufacturing cloth for themselves and their brothers During all this the father is too often defending himself against attorneys or making such terms as he can with the sheriff for debts in which he has been involved by the vicious idleness of his children and his own want of virtue and courage to break through the evil tyranny of old customs and compel his offspring to learn in early life to procure their subsistence by honest and honourable industry In this state of things there is not enough for all Pride forbids the sale of the slaves as long as it is possible to avoid it and their meagre allowance of corn is stinted rather than it shall be the master was obliged to sell them Somebody must suffer and self-preservation is the first law of nature says the proverb-- hunger must invade either the great house or the quarter and it is but reasonable to suppose that so unwelcome an intruder would be expelled to the last moment from the former In this conflict of pride and folly against industry and wisdom the slave-holders have been unhappily engaged for more than fifty years They are attempting to perform impossibilities-- to draw the means of supporting a life of idleness luxury and splendour from a once generous but long since worn out and exhausted soil--a soil which carefully used would at this day have richly repaid the toils of the husbandman by a noble abundance of all the comforts of life but which tortured into barrenness by the double curse of slavery and tobacco stands--and until its proprietors are regenerated and learn the difference between a land of slaves and a nation of freemen--must continue to stand a monument of the poverty and punishment which Providence has decreed as the reward of idleness and tyranny The general features of slavery are the same everywhere but the utmost rigour of the system is only to be met with on the cotton plantations of Carolina and Georgia or in the rice fields which skirt the deep swamps and morasses of the southern rivers In the tobacco fields of Maryland and Virginia great cruelties are practised-- not so frequently by the owners as by the overseers of the slaves but yet the tasks are not so excessive as in the cotton region nor is the press of labour so incessant throughout the year It is true that from the period when the tobacco plants are set in the field there is no resting time until it is housed but it is planted out about the first of May and must be cut and taken out of the field before the frost comes After it is hung and dried the labour of stripping and preparing it for the hogshead in leaf or of manufacturing it into twist is comparatively a work of leisure and ease Besides on almost every plantation the hands are able to complete the work of preparing the tobacco by January and sometimes earlier so that the winter months form some sort of respite from the toils of the year The people are obliged it is true to occupy themselves in cutting wood for the house making rails and repairing fences and in clearing new land to raise the tobacco plants for the next year but as there is usually time enough and to spare for the completion of all this work before the season arrives for setting the plants in the field the men are seldom flogged much unless they are very lazy or negligent and the women are allowed to remain in the house in very cold snowy or rainy weather I who am intimately acquainted with the slavery both of Maryland and Virginia and know that there is no material difference between the two aver that a description of one is a description of both and that the coloured people here have many advantages over those of the cotton region There are seldom more than one hundred of all ages and conditions kept on one tobacco plantation though there are sometimes many more but this is not frequent whilst on the cotton estates I have seen four or five hundred working together in the same vast field In Maryland the owners of the estates generally reside at home throughout the year and the mistress of the mansion is seldom absent more than a few weeks in the winter when she visits Baltimore or Washington-- the same is the case in Virginia Her constant residence on the estate makes her acquainted personally with all the slaves and she frequently interests herself in their welfare often interceding with the master her husband to prevent the overseer from beating them unmercifully The young ladies of the family also if there be any after they have left school are generally at home until they are married Each of them universally claims a young black girl as her own and takes her under her protection This enables the girl to extend the protection and friendship of her young mistress to her father mother brothers and sisters The sons of the family likewise have their favourites among the black boys and have many disputes with the overseer if he abuses them All these advantages accrue to the black people from the circumstance of the master and his family living at home In Maryland I never knew a mistress or a young mistress who would not listen to the complaints of the slaves It is true we were always obliged to approach the door of the mansion in the most humble and supplicating manner with our hats in our hands and the most subdued and beseeching language in our mouths--but in return we generally received words of kindness and very often a redress of our grievances though I have known very great ladies who would never grant any request from the plantation hands but always referred them and their petitions to their master under a pretence that they could not meddle with things that did not belong to the house The mistresses of the great families generally gave mild language to the slaves though they sometimes sent for the overseer and had them severely flogged but I have never heard any mistress in either Maryland or Virginia indulge in the low vulgar and profane vituperations of which I was myself the object in Georgia for several years whenever I came into the presence of my mistress Flogging--though often severe and excruciating in Maryland is not practised with the order regularity and system to which it is reduced in the south On the Potomac if a slave gives offence he is generally chastised on the spot in the field where he is at work as the overseer always carries a whip-- sometimes a twisted cow-hide sometimes a kind of horsewhip and very often a simple hickory switch or gad cut in the adjoining woods For stealing meat or other provisions or for any of the higher offences the slaves are stripped tied up by the hands--sometimes by the thumbs--and whipped at the quarter-- but many times on a large tobacco plantation there is not more than one of these regular whippings in a week--though on others where the master happens to be a bad man or a drunkard the back of the unhappy Maryland slave is seamed with scars from his neck to his hips It was my fortune whilst I was a slave in Maryland always to have comparatively mild masters and as I uniformly endeavoured to do whatever was held to be the duty of a good slave according to the customs of the country I was never tied up to be flogged there and never received a blow from my master after I was fifteen years old I was never under the control of an overseer in Maryland or it is very likely that I should not have been able to give this account of myself It is the custom of all the tobacco planters in Maryland and Virginia to plant a certain portion of their land in corn every year so much as they suppose will be sufficient to produce bread as they term it for the negroes By bread is understood a peck of corn per week for each of their slaves After my return from the navy-yard at Washington I was generally employed in the culture of tobacco but my attention was necessarily divided between the tobacco and the corn The corn crop is however only a matter of secondary consideration as no grain of any kind is grown for sale by the planters and if they raised as much in my time as supplied the wants of the people and the horses of the stable it was considered good farming The sale of the tobacco was regarded as the only means of obtaining money or any commodity which did not grow on the plantation It is unfortunate for the slaves that in a tobacco or cotton growing country no attention whatever is paid to the rearing of sheep--consequently there is no wool to make winter clothes for the people and oftentimes they suffer excessively from the cold whereas if their masters kept a good flock of sheep to supply them with wool they could easily spin and weave in their cabins a sufficiency of cloth to clothe them comfortably As many persons may be unacquainted with the process of cultivating tobacco a short account of the growth of this plant may not be uninteresting The operation is to be commenced in the month of February by clearing a piece of new land and burning the timber cut from it on the ground so as to form a coat of ashes over the whole space if possible This ground is then to be dug up with a hoe and the sticks and roots are to be carefully removed from it In this bed the tobacco seeds are sown about the beginning of March not in hills or in rows but by broad cast as in sowing turnips The seeds do not spring soon but generally the young plant appears early in April If the weather at the time the tobacco comes up as it is called is yet frosty a covering of pine tops or red cedar branches is thickly spread over the whole patch which consists of from one to four or five acres according to the dimensions of the plantation to be provided with plants As soon as the weather becomes fine and the young tobacco begins to grow the covering of the branches is removed and the bed is exposed to the rays of the sun From this time the patch must be carefully attended and kept clear of all grass and weeds In the months of March and April the people are busily employed in ploughing the fields in which the tobacco is to be planted in May Immediately after the corn is planted every one man woman and child able to work with a hoe or carry a tobacco plant is engaged in working up the whole plantation already ploughed a second time into hills about four feet apart laid out in regular rows across the field by the course of the furrows These hills are formed into squares or diamonds at equal distance both ways and into these are transplanted the tobacco plants from the beds in which the seeds were sown This transplantation must be done when the earth is wet with rain and it is best to do it if possible just before or at the time the rain falls as cabbages are transplanted in a kitchen garden but as the planting a field of one or two hundred acres with tobacco is not the work of an hour as soon as it is deemed certain that there will be a sufficient fall of rain to answer the purpose of planting out tobacco all hands are called to the tobacco field and no matter how fast it may rain or how violent the storm may be the removal of the plants from the bed and fixing them in the hills where they are to grow in the field goes on until the crop is planted out or the rain ceases and the sun begins to shine Nothing but the darkness of night and the short respite required by the scanty meal of the slaves produce any cessation in the labour of tobacco planting until the work is done or the rain ceases and the clouds disappear Some plants die under the operation of removal and their places are to be supplied from those left in the bed at the fall of the next rain Sometimes the tobacco worm appears amongst the plants before their removal from the bed and from the moment this loathsome reptile is seen the plants are to be carefully examined every day for the purpose of destroying any worms that may be found It is however not until the plants have been set in the field and have begun to grow and flourish that the worms come forth in their fall strength If unmolested they would totally destroy the largest field of tobacco in the months of June and July At this season of the year every slave that is able to kill a tobacco worm is kept in the field from morning until night Those who are able to work with hoes are engaged in weeding the tobacco and at the same time destroying all the worms they find The children do nothing but search for and destroy the worms All this labour and vigilance however would not suffice to keep the worms under were it not for the aid of turkeys and ducks On some large estates they raise from one to two hundred turkeys and as many ducks--not for the purpose of sale but for the destruction of tobacco worms The ducks live in the tobacco field day and night except when they go to water and as they are great gormandizers they take from the plants and destroy an infinite number of worms They are fond of them as an article of food and require no watching to keep them in their place but it is otherwise with the turkeys These require very peculiar treatment They must be kept all night in a large coop spacious enough to contain the whole flock with poles for them to roost on As soon as it is light in the morning the coop is opened the flock turned out and driven to the tobacco field Two hundred turkeys should be followed by four or five active lads or young men to keep them together and at their duty One turkey will destroy as many worms as five men could do in the same period of time but it seems that tobacco worm are not the natural food of turkeys and they are prone to break out of the field and escape to the woods or pastures in search of grasshoppers which they greatly prefer to tobacco worms for breakfast However if kept amongst the tobacco they commit terrible ravages amongst the worms and will eat until they are filled up to the throat When they cease eating worms they are to be driven back to the coop and shut up where they must have plenty of water and a peck of corn to a hundred turkeys If they get no corn and are forced to live on tobacco worms only they droop become sickly and would doubtlessly die In the evening they are again driven to the field and treated again in the same manner as in the morning The tobacco worm is of a bright green colour with a series of rings or circles round its body I have seen them as large as a man's longest finger I was never able to discover in what manner they originate They certainly do not change into a butterfly as some other worms do and I could never perceive that they deposite eggs anywhere I am of opinion that there is something in the very nature of the tobacco plant which produces these nauseous reptiles for they are too large when at full growth to be ranked with insects In the month of August the tobacco crop is laid by as it is termed which means that they cease working in the fields for the purpose of destroying the weeds and grass the plants having now become so large as not to be injured by the under vegetation Still however the worms continue their ravages and it is necessary to employ all hands in destroying them In this month also the tobacco is to be topped if it has not been done before When the plants have reached the height of two or three feet according to the goodness of the soil and the vigour of the growth the top is to be cut off to prevent it from going to seed This topping causes all the powers of the plant which would be exhausted in the formation of flowers and seeds to expand in leaves fit for use After the tobacco is fully grown which in some plants happens early in August it is to be carefully watched to see when it is ripe or fit for cutting The state of the plant is known by its colour and by certain pale spots which appear on the leaves It does not all arrive at maturity at the same time and although some plants ripen early in August others are not ripe before the middle of September When the plants are cut down they are laid on the ground for a short time then taken up and the stalks split open to facilitate the drying of the leaves In this condition it is removed to the drying house and there hung up under sheds until it is fully dry From thence it is removed into the tobacco house and laid up in bulk ready for stripping and manufacturing V It is time to resume the narrative of my journey southward At the period of which I now write tobacco was universally cultivated in those parts of Virginia through which I travelled and that with the corn crops constituted nearly the whole objects of agricultural labour The quantity of wheat and rye which I saw on my journey was very small A little oats was growing on the estates of some gentlemen who were fond of breeding fine horses I did not perceive any material difference in the condition of the country as I passed south until after crossing the Roanoke river Near this stream we passed a very large estate on which there appeared to me to be nearly a thousand acres of tobacco growing Our master was informed by a gentleman whom we met here that this property belonged to Mr Randolph a member of Congress and one of the largest planters in Virginia The land appeared to me not to be any better than the tobacco lands in Maryland though a little more sandy The mansion house was low and of ordinary appearance The fields were badly fenced and the whole place was in poor condition We passed close by a gang of near a hundred hands--men and women at work with hoes in a tobacco field I had not in all Virginia seen any slaves more destitute of clothes Many of the men and some of the young women were without shirts and several young lads had only a few rags about their loins Their skins looked dry and husky which proved that they were not well fed They were followed by an overseer who carried in his hand a kind of whip which I had never before seen though I afterward became familiar with this terrible weapon South of the Roanoke the land became more sandy and pine timber generally prevailed--in many places to the exclusion of all other trees In North Carolina the same course of culture is pursued as that which I have noted in Virginia and the same disastrous consequences result from it though as the country has not been settled so long as the northern part of Virginia and Maryland so great a portion of the land has not been worn out and abandoned in the former as in the latter Here also the red cedar is seldom seen as the pitch-pine takes possession of all waste and deserted fields In this state the houses are not so well built as they are further north there are fewer carriages and the number of good horses judging from those I saw on the road must be much less The inhabitants of the country are plainer in their dress and they have fewer people of fashion than are to be met in Virginia The plantations here were not so large as those I saw on the north of the Roanoke but larger tracts of country are covered with wood than any I had heretofore seen The condition of the slaves is not worse here than it is in Virginia nor is there any wheat in Carolina worth speaking of As we approached the Yadkin river the tobacco disappeared from the fields and the cotton plant took its place as an article of general culture We passed the Yadkin by a ferry on Sunday morning and on the Wednesday following in the evening our master told us we were in the state of South Carolina We staid this night in a small town called Lancaster and I shall never forget the sensations which I experienced this evening on finding myself in chains in the state of South Carolina From my earliest recollections the name of South Carolina had been little less terrible to me than that of the bottomless pit In Maryland it had always been the practice of masters and mistresses who wished to terrify their slaves to threaten to sell them to South Carolina where it was represented that their condition would be a hundred fold worse than it was in Maryland I had regarded such a sale of myself as the greatest of evils that could befall me and had striven to demean myself in such manner to my owners as to preclude them from all excuse for transporting me to so horrid a place At length I found myself without having committed any crime or even the slightest transgression in the place and condition of which I had through life entertained the greatest dread I slept but little this night and for the first time felt weary of life It appeared to me that the cup of my misery was full-- that there was no hope of release from my present chains unless it might be to exchange them for the long lash of the ov rseers of the cotton plantations in each of whose hands I observed such a whip as I saw in possession of Mr Randolph's slave driver in Virginia I seriously meditated on self-destruction and had I been at liberty to get a rope I believe I should have hanged myself at Lancaster It appeared to me that such an act done by a man in my situation could not be a violation of the precepts of religion nor of the laws of God I had now no hope of ever again seeing my wife and children or of revisiting the scenes of my youth I apprehended that I should if I lived suffer the most excruciating pangs that extreme and long continued hunger could inflict for I had often heard that in South Carolina the slaves were compelled in times of scarcity to live on cotton seeds From the dreadful apprehensions of future evil which harrassed and harrowed my mind that night I do not marvel that the slaves who are driven to the south often destroy themselves Self-destruction is much more frequent among the slaves in the cotton region than is generally supposed When a negro kills himself the master is unwilling to let it be known lest the deed should be attributed to his own cruelty A certain degree of disgrace falls upon the master whose slave has committed suicide--and the same man who would stand by and see his overseer give his slave a hundred lashes with the long whip on his bare back without manifesting the least pity for the sufferings of the poor tortured wretch will express very profound regret if the same slave terminates his own life to avoid a repetition of the horrid flogging Suicide amongst the slaves is regarded as a matter of dangerous example and one which it is the business and the interest of all proprietors to discountenance and prevent All the arguments which can be devised against it are used to deter the negroes from the perpetration of it and such as take this dreadful means of freeing themselves from their miseries are always branded in reputation after death as the worst of criminals and their bodies are not allowed the small portion of Christian rites which are awarded to the corpses of other slaves Surely if any thing can justify a man in taking his life into his own hands and terminating his existence no one can attach blame to the slaves on many of the cotton plantations of the south when they cut short their breath and the agonies of the present being by a single stroke What is life worth amidst hunger nakedness and excessive toil under the continually uplifted lash It was long after midnight before I fell asleep but the most pleasant dreams succeeded to these sorrowful forebodings I thought I had by some means escaped from my master and through infinite and unparalleled dangers and sufferings had made my way back to Maryland and was again in the cabin of my wife with two of my little children on my lap whilst their mother was busy in preparing for me a supper of fried fish such as she often dressed when I was at home and had taken to her the fish I had caught in the Patuxent river Every object was so vividly impressed upon my imagination in this dream that when I awoke a firm conviction settled upon my mind that by some means at present incomprehensible to me I should yet again embrace my wife and caress my children in their humble dwelling Early in the morning our master called us up and distributed to each of the party a cake made of corn meal and a small piece of bacon On our journey we had only eaten twice a day and had not received breakfast until about nine o'clock but he this morning meal was given to welcome us to South Carolina He then addressed us all and told us we might now give up all hope of ever returning to the places of our nativity as it would be impossible for us to pass through the states of North Carolina and Virginia without being taken up and sent back He further advised us to make ourselves contented as he would take us to Georgia a far better country than any we had seen and where we would be able to live in the greatest abundance About sunrise we took up our march on the road to Columbia as we were told Hitherto our master had not offered to sell any of us and had even refused to stop to talk to any one on the subject of our sale although he had several times been addressed on this point before we reached Lancaster but soon after we departed from this village we were overtaken on the road by a man on horseback who accosted our driver by asking him if his niggers were for sale The latter replied that he believed he would not sell any yet as he was on his way to Georgia and cotton being now much in demand he expected to obtain high prices for us from persons who were going to settle in the new purchase He however contrary to his custom ordered us to stop and told the stranger he might look at us and that he would find us as fine a lot of hands as were ever imported into the country--that we were all prime property and he had no doubt would command his own prices in Georgia The stranger who was a thin weather-beaten sun-burned figure then he wanted a couple of breeding-wenches and would give as much for them as they would bring in Georgia--that he had lately heard from Augusta and that niggers were not higher there than in Columbia and as he had been in Columbia the week before he knew what niggers were worth He then walked along our line as we stood chained together and looked at the whole of us--then turning to the women asked the prices of the two pregnant ones Our master replied that these were two of the best breeding-wenches in all Maryland--that one was twenty-two and the other only nineteen--that the first was already the mother of seven children and the other of four--that he had himself seen the children at the time he bought their mothers--and that such wenches would be cheap at a thousand dollars each but as they were not able to keep up with the gang he would take twelve hundred dollars for the two The purchaser this was too much but that he would give nine hundred dollars for the pair This price was promptly refused but our master after some consideration he was willing to sell a bargain in these wenches and would take eleven hundred dollars for them which was objected to on the other side and many faults and failings were pointed out in the merchandise After much bargaining and many gross jests on the part of the stranger he offered a thousand dollars for the two and he would give no more He then mounted his horse and moved off but after he had gone about one hundred yards he was called back and our master if he would go with him to the next blacksmith's shop on the road to Columbia and pay for taking the irons off the rest of us he might have the two women This proposal was agreed to and as it was now about nine o'clock we were ordered to hasten on to the next house where we were told we must stop for breakfast At this place we were informed that it was ten miles to the next smith's shop and our new acquaintance was obliged by the terms of his contract to accompany us thither We received for breakfast about a pint of boiled rice to each person and after this was despatched we again took to the road eager to reach the blacksmith's shop at which we expected to be relieved of the iron rings and chains which had so long galled and worried us About two o'clock we arrived at the longed-for residence of the smith but on inquiry our master was informed that he was not at home and would not return before evening Here a controversy arose whether we should all remain here until the smith returned or the stranger should go on with us to the next smithery which was to be only five miles distant This was a point not easily settled between two such spirits as our master and the stranger both of whom had been overseers in their time and both of whom had risen to the rank of proprietors of slaves The matter had already produced angry words and much vaunting on the part of the stranger-- that a freeman of South Carolina was not to be imposed upon that by the constitution of the state his rights were sacred and he was not to be deprived of his liberty at the arbitrary will of a man just from amongst the Yankees and who had brought with him to the south as many Yankee tricks as he had niggers and he believed many more He then swore that all the niggers in the drove were Yankee niggers When I overseed for Colonel Polk he on his rice plantation he had two Yankee niggers that he brought from Maryland and they were running away every day I gave them a hundred lashes more than a dozen times but they never quit running away till I chained them together with iron collars round their necks and chained them to spades and made them do nothing but dig ditches to drain the rice swamps They could not run away then unless they went together and carried their chains and spades with them I kept them in this way two years and better niggers I never had One of them died one night and the other was never good for any thing after he lost his mate He never ran away afterwards but he died too after a while He then addressed himself to the two women whose master he had become and told them that if ever they ran away he would treat them in the same way Wretched as I was myself my heart bled for these poor creatures who had fallen into the hands of a tiger in human form The dispute between the two masters was still raging when unexpectedly the blacksmith rode up to his house on a thin bony-looking horse and dismounting asked his wife what these gentlemen were making such a frolick about I did not hear her answer but both the disputants turned and addressed themselves to the smith--the one to know what price he would demand to take the irons off all these niggers and the other to know how long it would take him to perform the work It is here proper for me to observe that there are many phrases of language in common use in Carolina and Georgia which are applied in a way that would not be understood by persons from one of the northern states For instance when several persons are quarrelling brawling making a great noise or even fighting they say the gentlemen are frolicking I heard many other terms equally strange whilst I resided in the southern country amongst such white people as I became acquainted with though my acquaintance was confined in a great measure to overseers and such people as did not associate with the rich planters and great families The smith at length agreed to take the irons from the whole of us for two dollars and fifty cents and immediately set about it with the air of indifference that he would have manifested in tearing a pair of old shoes from the hoofs of a wagon-horse It was four weeks and five days from the time my irons had been riveted upon me until they were removed and great as had been my sufferings whilst chained to my fellow-slaves I cannot say that I felt any pleasure in being released from my long confinement for I knew that my liberation was only preparatory to my final and as I feared perpetual subjugation to the power of some such monster as the one then before me who was preparing to drive away the two unfortunate women whom he had purchased and whose life's-blood he had acquired the power of shedding at pleasure for the sum of a thousand dollars After we were released from our chains our master sold the whole lot of irons which we had borne from Maryland to the blacksmith for seven dollars The smith then procured a bottle of rum and treated his two new acquaintances to a part of its contents--wishing them both good luck with their niggers After these civilities were over the two women were ordered to follow their new master who shaped his course across the country by a road leading westward At parting from us they both wept aloud and wrung their hands in despair We all went to them and bade them a last farewell Their road led into a wood which they soon entered and I never saw them nor heard of them again These women had both been driven from Calvert county as well as myself and the fate of the younger of the two was peculiarly severe She had been brought up as the waiting-maid of a young lady the daughter of a gentleman whose wife and family often visited the mistress of my own wife I had frequently seen this woman when she was a young girl in attendance upon her young mistress and riding in the same carriage with her The father of the young lady died and soon after she married a gentleman who resided a few miles off The husband received a considerable fortune with his bride and amongst other things her waiting-maid who was reputed a great beauty among people of colour He had been addicted to the fashionable sports of the country before marriage such as horse-racing fox-hunting c and I had heard the black people say he drank too freely but it was supposed that he would correct all these irregularities after marriage more especially as his wife was a great belle and withal very handsome The reverse however turned out to be the fact Instead of growing better he became worse and in the course of a few years was known all over the country as a drunkard and a gambler His wife it was died of grief and soon after her death his effects were seized by his creditors and sold by the sheriff The former waiting-maid now the mother of several children was purchased by our present master for three hundred dollars at the sheriff's sale and this poor wretch whose employment in early life had been to take care of her young mistress and attend her in her chamber and at her toilet after being torn from her husband and her children had now gone to toil out a horrible existence beneath the scorching sun of a South Carolina cotton field under the dominion of a master as void of the manners of a gentleman as he was of the language of humanity It was now late in the afternoon but as we had made little progress to-day and were now divested of the burden of our chains as well as freed from the two women who had hitherto much retarded our march our master ordered us to hasten on our way as we had ten miles to go that evening I had been so long oppressed by the weight of my chains and the iron collar about my neck that for some time after I commenced walking at my natural liberty I felt a kind of giddiness or lightness of the head Most of my companions complained of the same sensation and we did not recover our proper feelings until after we had slept one night It was after dark when we arrived at our lodging-place which proved to be the house of a small cotton-planter who it appeared kept a sort of a house of entertainment for travellers contrary to what I afterwards discovered to be the usual custom of cotton-planters This man and my master had known each other before and seemed to be well acquainted He was the first person that we had met since leaving Maryland who was known to my master and as they kept up a very free conversation through the course of the evening and the house in which they were was only separated from the kitchen in which we were lodged by a space of a few feet I had an opportunity of hearing much that was highly interesting to me The landlord after supper came with our master to look at us and to see us receive our allowance of boiled rice from the hands of a couple of black women who had prepared it in a large iron kettle Whilst viewing us the former asked the latter what he intended to do with his drove but no reply was made to this inquiry--and as our master had through our whole journey maintained a studied silence on this subject I felt a great curiosity to know what disposition he intended to make of the whole gang and of myself in particular On their return to the house I advanced to a small window in the kitchen which brought me within a few yards of the place where they sat and from which I was able to hear all they although they spoke in a low tone of voice I here learned that so many of us as could be sold for a good price were to be disposed of in Columbia on our arrival at that place and that the residue would be driven to Augusta and sold there The landlord assured my master that at this time slaves were much in demand both in Columbia and Augusta that purchasers were numerous and prices good and that the best plan of effecting good sales would be to put up each nigger separately at auction after giving a few days' notice by an advertisement in the neighbouring country Cotton he had not been higher for many years and as a great many persons especially young men were moving off to the new purchase in Georgia prime hands were in high demand for the purpose of clearing the land in the new country--that the boys and girls under twenty would bring almost any price at present in Columbia for the purpose of picking the growing crop of cotton which promised to be very heavy and as most persons had planted more than their hands would be able to pick young niggers who would soon learn to pick cotton were prime articles in the market As to those more advanced in life he seemed to think the prospect of selling them at an unusual price not so good as they could not so readily become expert cotton-pickers-- he further that from some cause which he could not comprehend the price of rice had not been so good this year as usual and that he had found it cheaper to purchase rice to feed his own niggers than to provide them with corn which had to be brought from the upper country He therefore advised my master not to drive us towards the rice plantation of the low country My master he would follow his advice at least so far as to sell a portion of us in Carolina but seemed to be of opinion that his prime hands would bring him more money in Georgia and named me in particular as one who would be worth at least a thousand dollars to a man who was about making a settlement and clearing a plantation in the new purchase I therefore concluded that in the course of events I was likely to become the property of a Georgian which turned out in the end to be the case though not so soon as I at this time apprehended I slept but little this night feeling a restlessness when no longer in chains and pondering over the future lot of my life which appeared fraught only with evil and misfortune Day at length dawned and with its first light we were ordered to betake ourselves to the road which we were told would lead us to Columbia the place of intended sale of some if not all of us For several days past I had observed that in the country through which we travelled little attention was paid to the cultivation of any thing but cotton Now this plant was almost the sole possessor of the fields It covered the plantations adjacent to the road as far as I could see both before and behind me and looked not unlike buckwheat before it blossoms I saw some small fields of corn and lots of sweet potatoes amongst which the young vines of the water-melon were frequently visible The improvements on the plantations were not good There were no barns but only stables and sheds to put the cotton under as it was brought from the field Hay seemed to be unknown in the country for I saw neither hay-stacks nor meadows and the few fields that were lying fallow had but small numbers of cattle in them and these were thin and meagre We had met with no flocks of sheep of late and the hogs that we saw on the road-side were in bad condition The horses and mules that I saw at work in the cotton-fields were poor and badly harnessed and the half-naked condition of the negroes who drove them or followed with the hoe together with their wan complexions proved to me that they had too much work or not enough food We passed a cotton-gin this morning the first that I ever saw but they were not at work with it We also met a party of ladies and gentlemen on a journey of pleasure riding in two very handsome carriages drawn by sleek and spirited horses very different in appearance from the moving skeletons that I had noticed drawing the ploughs in the fields The black drivers of the coaches were neatly clad in gay-coloured clothes and contrasted well with their half-naked brethren a gang of whom were hoeing cotton by the road-side near them attended by an overseer in a white linen shirt and pantaloons with one of the long negro whips in his hand I observed that these poor people did not raise their heads to look either at the fine coaches and horses then passing or at us but kept their faces steadily bent towards the cotton-plants from among which they were removing the weeds I almost shuddered at the sight knowing that I myself was doomed to a state of servitude equally cruel and debasing unless by some unforeseen occurrence I might fail into the hands of a master of less inhumanity of temper than the one who had possession of the miserable creatures before me VI It was manifest that I was now in a country where the life of a black man was no more regarded than that of an ox except as far as the man was worth the more money in the market On all the plantations that we passed there was a want of live stock of every description except slaves and they wore deplorably abundant The fields were destitute of every thing that deserved the name of grass and not a spear of clover was anywhere visible The few cattle that existed were browsing on the boughs of the trees in the woods Every thing betrayed a scarcity of the means of supplying the slaves who cultivated the vast cotton-fields with a sufficiency of food We travelled this day more than thirty miles and crossed the Catawba river in the afternoon on the bottoms of which I saw for the first time fields of rice growing in swamps covered with water Causeways were raised through the low-lands in which the rice grew and on these the road was formed on which we travelled These rice-fields or rather swamps had in my eyes a beautiful appearance The rice was nearly two feet in height above the water and of a vivid green colour covering a large space of at least a hundred acres Had it not been for the water which appeared stagnant and sickly and swarmed with frogs and thousands of snakes it would have been as fine a sight as one need wish to took upon After leaving the low grounds along the river we again entered plantations of cotton which lined the roads on both sides relieved here and there by corn-fields and potato-patches We stopped for the night at a small tavern and our master we were within a day's journey of Columbia We here again received boiled rice for supper without salt or any kind of seasoning a pint was allotted to each person which we greedily devoured having had no dinner to-day save an allowance of corn-cakes with the fat of about five pounds of bacon extracted by frying in which we dipped our bread I slept soundly after this day's march the fatigues of the body having for once overcome the agitations of the mind The next day which was if my recollection is accurate the ninth of June was the last of our journey before our company separated and we were on the road before the stars had disappeared from the sky Our breakfast this morning consisted of bacon soup a dish composed of corn meal boiled in water with a small piece of bacon to give the soup a taste of meat For dinner we had boiled Indian peas with a small allowance of bacon This was the first time that we had received two rations of meat in the same day on the whole journey and some of our party were much surprised at the kindness of our master but I had no doubt that his object was to make us look fat and hearty to enable him to obtain better prices for us at Columbia At supper this night we had corn mush in large wooden trays with melted lard to dip the mush in before eating it We might have reached Columbia this day if we had continued our march but we stopped at least an hour before sun-set about three miles from town at the house of a man who supported the double character of planter and keeper of a house of entertainment for I learned from his slaves that their master considered it disreputable to be called a tavern-keeper and would not put up a sign although he received pay of such persons as lodged with him His house was a frame building weather-boarded with pine boards but had no plastering within The furniture corresponded with the house which contained it and was both scanty and mean consisting of pine tables and wooden chairs with bottoms made of corn husks The house was only one story high and all the rooms six or seven in number parlour bed-rooms and kitchen were on the first floor As the weather was warm and the windows open I had an opportunity of looking into the sleeping rooms of the family as I walked round the house which I was permitted freely to do The beds and their furniture answered well to the chairs and tables yet in the large front room I observed on an old fashioned side-board a great quantity of glass ware of various descriptions with two or three dozen silver spoons a silver tea urn and several knives and forks with silver handles In the corner of this room stood a bed with gaudy red curtains with figures of lions elephants naked negroes and other representations of African scenery The master of the house was not at home when we arrived but came in from the field shortly afterwards He met my master with the cordiality of an old friend though he had never seen him before he was happy to see him at his house and that the greatest pleasure he enjoyed was derived from the entertainment of such gentlemen as thought proper to visit his house that he was always glad to see strangers and more especially gentlemen who were adding so much to the wealth and population of Carolina as those merchants who imported servants from the north He then observed that he had never seen a finer lot of property pass his house than we were and that any gentleman who brought such a stock of hands into the country was a public benefactor and entitled to the respect and gratitude of every friend of the south He assured my master that he was happy to see him at his house and that if he thought proper to remain a few days with him it would be his chief business to introduce him to the gentlemen of the neighbourhood who would all be glad to become acquainted with a merchant of his respectability In the state of Maryland my master had been called a negro buyer or Georgia trader sometimes a negro driver but here I found that he was elevated to the rank of merchant and a merchant of the first order too for it was very clear that in the opinion of the landlord no branch of trade was more honourable than the traffic in us poor slaves Our master observed that he had a mind to remain here a short time and try what kind of market Columbia would present for the sale of his lot of servants and that he would make this house his home until he had ascertained what could be done in town and what demand there was in the neighbourhood for servants We were not called slaves by these men who talked of selling us and of the price we would bring with as little compunction of conscience as they would have talked of the sale of so many mules It is the custom throughout all the slave-holding states amongst people of fashion never to speak of their negroes as slaves but always as servants but I had never before met with the keeper of a public house in the country who had arrived at this degree of refinement I had been accustomed to hear this order of men and indeed the greater number of white people speak of the people of colour as niggers We remained at this place more than two weeks I presume because my master found it cheaper to keep us here than in town or perhaps because he supposed we might recover from the hardships of our journey more speedily in the country As it was here that my real acquaintance with South Carolina commenced I have noted with more particularity the incidents that occurred than I otherwise should have done This family was composed of the husband wife three daughters all young women and two sons one of whom appeared to be about twenty and the other perhaps seventeen years old They had nine slaves in all one very old man quite crooked with years and labour--two men of middle age--one lad perhaps sixteen--one woman with three children the oldest about seven--and a young girl of twelve or fourteen The farm or plantation they lived on contained about one hundred and fifty acres of cleared land sandy and the greater part of it poor as was proved by the stinted growth of the cotton At the time of our arrival at this house I saw no persons about it except the four ladies--the mother and her three daughters--the husband being in the field as noticed above According to the orders of my master I had taken the saddle from his horse and put him in a stable and it was not until after the first salutations of the new landlord to my master were over that he seemed to think of asking him whether he had come on foot on horse-back or in a coach He at length however turned suddenly and asked him with an air of surprise where he had left his horses and carriage My master he had no carriage that he travelled on horseback and that his horse was in the stable The landlord then apologized for the trouble he must have had in having his horse put away himself and that at this season of the year the planters were so hurried by their crops and found so much difficulty in keeping down the grass that they were generally obliged to keep all their servants in the field that for his part he had been compelled to put his coachman and even the waiting-maids of his daughters into the cotton fields and that at this time his family were without servants a circumstance that had never happened before For my part he I have always prided myself on bringing up my family well and can say that although I do not live in so fine a house as some of the other planters of Carolina yet my children are as great ladies and gentlemen as any in the state Not one of them has ever had to do a day's work yet and as long as I live never shall I sent two of my daughters to Charleston last summer and they were there three months and I intend to send the youngest there this summer They have all learned to dance here in Columbia where I sent them two quarters to a Frenchman and he made me pay pretty well for it They went to the same dancing school with the daughters of Wade Hampton and Colonel Fitzhugh I am determined that they shall never marry any but gentlemen of the first character and I know they will always follow my advice in matters of this kind They are prudent and sensible girls and are not going to do as Major Pollack's daughter did this spring who ran away with a Georgia cracker who brought a drove of cattle for sale from the Indian country and who had not a nigger in the world He staid with me sometime and wished to have something to say to my second daughter but the thing would not do Here he stopped short in his narrative and seeming to muse a moment to his guest I presume as you travel alone you have no family No replied my master I am a single man I thought so by your appearance the loquacious landlord and I shall be glad to introduce you to my family this evening My sons are two as fine fellows as there are in all Carolina My oldest boy is lieutenant in the militia and in the same company that marched with Gen Marion in the war He was on the point of fighting a duel last winter with young M'Corkle in Columbia but the matter was settled between them You will see him this evening when he returns from the coit-party A coit-party of young bucks meets once every week about two miles from this and as I wish my sons to keep the best company they both attend it There is to be a cock-fight there this afternoon and my youngest son Edmund has the finest cock in this country He is of the true game blood--the real Dominica game breed and I sent to Charleston for his gaffs There is a bet of ten dollars a side between my son's cock and one belonging to young Blainey the son of Major Blainey Young Blainey is a hot-headed young blood and has been concerned in three duels though I believe he never fought but one but I know Edmund will not take a word from him and it will be well if he and his cock do not both get well licked Here the conversation was arrested by the sound of horses' feet on the road and in the next instant two young men rode up at a gallop mounted on lean looking horses one of the riders carrying a pole on his shoulder with a game cock in a net bag tied to one end of it On perceiving them the landlord exclaimed with an oath There's two lads of spirit stranger--and if you will allow me the liberty of asking you your name I will introduce you to them At the suggestion of his name my master seemed to hesitate a little but after a moment's pause They call me M'Giffin sir My name is Hulig sir replied the landlord and I am very happy to be acquainted with you Mr M'Giffin at the same time shaking him by the hand and introducing his two sons who were by this time at the door This was the first time I had ever heard the name of my master although I had been with him five weeks I had never seen him before the day on which he seized and bound me in Maryland and as he took me away immediately I did not hear his name at the time The people who assisted to fetter me either from accident or design omitted to name him and after we commenced our journey he had maintained so much distant reserve and austerity of manner towards us all that no one ventured to ask him his name We had called him nothing but master and the various persons at whose houses we had stopped on our way knew as little of his name as we did We had frequently been asked the name of our master and perhaps had not always obtained credence when we we did not know it Throughout the whole journey until after we were released from our irons he had forbidden us to converse together beyond a few words in relation to our temporary condition and wants and as he was with us all day and never slept out of hearing of us at night he rigidly enforced his edict of silence I presume that the reason of this prohibition of all conversation was to prevent us from devising plans of escape but he had imposed as rigid a silence on himself as was enforced upon us and after having passed from Maryland to South Carolina in his company I knew no more of my master than that he knew how to keep his secrets guard his slaves and make a close bargain I had never heard him speak of his home or family and therefore had concluded that he was an unmarried man and an adventurer who felt no more attachment for one place than another and whose residence was not very well settled but from the large sums of money which he must have been able to command and carry with him to the north to enable him to purchase so large a number of slaves I had no doubt that he was a man of consequence and consideration in the place from whence he came In Maryland I had always observed that men who were the owners of large stocks of negroes were not averse to having publicity given to their names and that the possession of this species of property even there gave its owner more vanity and egotism than fell to the lot of the holders of any other kind of estate and in truth my subsequent experience proved that without the possession of slaves no man could ever arrive at or hope to rise to any honourable station in society--yet my master seemed to take no pride in having at his disposal the lives of so many human beings He never spoke to us in words of either pity or hatred and never spoke of us except to order us to be fed or watered as he would have directed the same offices to be performed for so many horses or to inquire where the best prices could be obtained for us He regarded us only as objects of traffic and the materials of his commerce and although he had lived several years in Carolina and Georgia and had there exercised the profession of an overseer he regarded the southern planters as no less the subjects of trade and speculation than the slaves he sold to them as will appear in the sequal It was to this man that the landlord introduced his two sons and upon whom he was endeavouring to impose a belief that he was the head of a family which took rank with those of the first planters of the district The ladies of the household though I had seen them in the kitchen when I walked round the house had not yet presented themselves to my master nor indeed were they in a condition to be seen anywhere but in the apartment they occupied at the time The young gentlemen gave a very gasconading account of the coit-party and cock-fight from which they had just returned and according to their version of the affair it might have been an assemblage of at least half the military officers of the state for all the persons of whom they spoke were captains majors and colonels The eldest he had won two bowls of punch at coits and the youngest whose cock had been victor in the battle on which ten dollars were staked vaunted much of the qualities of his bird and supported his veracity by numerous oaths and reiterated appeals to his brother for the truth of his assertions Both these young men were so much intoxicated that they with difficulty maintained an erect posture in walking By this time the sun was going down and I observed two female slaves a woman and girl approaching the house on the side of the kitchen from the cotton field They were coming home to prepare supper for the family the ladies whom I had seen in the kitchen not having been there for the purpose of performing the duties appropriate to that station but having sought it as a place of refuge from the sight of my master who had approached the front of their dwelling silently and so suddenly as not to permit them to gain the foot of the stairway in the large front room without being seen by him to whose view they by no means wished to expose themselves before they had visited their toilets About dark the supper was ready in the large room and as it had two fronts one of which looked into the yard where my companions and I had been permitted to seat ourselves and had an opportunity of seeing by the light of the candle all that was done within and of hearing all that was The ladies four in number had entered the room before the gentlemen and when the latter came in my master was introduced by the landlord to his wife and daughters by the name and title of Colonel M'Giffin which at that time impressed me with a belief that he was really an officer and that he had disclosed this circumstance without my knowledge but I afterwards perceived that in the south it is deemed respectful to address a stranger by the title of Colonel or Major or General if his appearance will warrant the association of so high a rank with his name My master had declared his intention of becoming the inmate of this family for some time and no pains seemed to be spared on their part to impress upon his mind the high opinion that they entertained of the dignity of the owner of fifty slaves the possession of so large a number of human creatures being in Carolina a certificate of character which entitles its bearer to enter whatever society he may choose to select without any thing more being known of his birth his life or reputation The man who owns fifty servants must needs be a gentleman amongst the higher ranks and the owner of half a hundred niggers is a sort of nobleman amongst the low the ignorant and the vulgar The mother and three daughters whose appearance when I saw them in the kitchen would have warranted the conclusion that they had just risen from bed without having time to adjust their dress were now gaily if not neatly attired and the two female slaves who had come from the field at sundown to cook the supper now waited at the table The landlord talked much of his crops his plantation and slaves and of the distinguished families who exchanged visits with his own but my master took very little part in the conversation of the evening and appeared disposed to maintain the air of mystery which had hitherto invested his character After it was quite dark the slaves came in from the cotton-field and taking little notice of us went into the kitchen and each taking thence a pint of corn proceeded to a little mill which was nailed to a post in the yard and there commenced the operation of grinding meal for their suppers which were afterwards to be prepared by baking the meal into cakes at the fire The woman who was the mother of the three small children was permitted to grind her allowance of corn first and after her came the old man and the others in succession After the corn was converted into meal each one kneaded it up with cold water into a thick dough and raking away the ashes from a small space on the kitchen hearth placed the dough rolled up in green leaves in the hollow and covering it with hot embers left it to be baked into bread which was done in about half an hour These loaves constituted the only supper of the slaves belonging to this family for I observed that the two women who had waited at the table after the supper of the white people was disposed of also came with their corn to the mill on the post and ground their allowance like the others They had not been permitted to taste even the fragments of the meal that they had cooked for their masters and mistresses It was eleven o'clock before these people had finished their supper of cakes and several of them especially the younger of the two lads were so overpowered with toil and sleep that they had to be roused from their slumbers when their cakes were done to devour them We had for our supper to-night a pint of boiled rice to each person and a small quantity of stale and very rancid butter from the bottom of an old keg or firkin which contained about two pounds the remnant of that which once filled it We boiled the rice ourselves in a large iron kettle and as our master now informed us that we were to remain here some time many of us determined to avail ourselves of this season of respite from our toils to wash our clothes and free our persons from the vermin which had appeared amongst our party several weeks before and now begun to be extremely tormenting As we were not allowed any soap we were obliged to resort to the use of a very fine and unctuous kind of clay resembling fullers' earth but of a yellow colour which was found on the margin of a small swamp near the house This was the first time that I had ever heard of clay being used for the purpose of washing clothes but I often availed myself of this resource afterwards whilst I was a slave in the south We wet our clothes then rubbed this clay all over the garments and by scouring it out in warm water with our hands the cloth whether of woollen cotton or linen texture was left entirely clean We subjected our persons to the same process and in this way freed our camp from the host of enemies that had been generated in the course of our journey This washing consumed the whole of the first day of our residence on the plantation of Mr Hulig We all lay the first night in a shed or summer kitchen standing behind the house and a few yards from it a place in which the slaves of the plantation washed their clothes and passed their Sundays in warm weather when they did not work but as this place was quite too small to accommodate our party or indeed to contain us without crowding us together in such a manner as to endanger our health we were removed the morning after our arrival to an old decayed frame building about one hundred yards from the house which had been erected as I learned for a cotton-gin but into which its possessor for want of means I presume had never introduced the machinery of the gin This building was near forty feet square was without any other floor than the earth and had neither doors nor windows to close the openings which had been left for the admission of those who entered it We were told that in this place the cotton of the plantation was deposited in the picking season as it was brought from the field until it could be removed to a neighbouring plantation where there was a gin to divest it of its seeds Here we took our temporary abode--men and women promiscuously Our provisions whilst we remained here were regularly distributed to us and the daily allowance to each person consisted of a pint of corn a pint of rice and about three or four pounds of butter such as we had received on the night of our arrival divided amongst us in small pieces from the point of a table knife The rice we boiled in the iron kettle--we ground our corn at the little mill on the post in the kitchen and converted the meal into bread in the manner we had been accustomed to at home--sometimes on the hearth and sometimes before the fire on a hoe The butter was given us as an extraordinary ration to strengthen and recruit us after our long march and give us a healthy and expert appearance at the time of our future sale We had no beds of any kind to sleep on but each one was provided with a blanket which had been the companion of our travels We were left entirely at liberty to go out or in when we pleased and no watch was kept over us either by night or day Our master had removed us so far from our native country that he supposed it impossible for any of us ever to escape from him and surmount all the obstacles that lay between us and our former homes He went away immediately after we were established in our new lodgings and remained absent until the second evening about sundown when he returned came into our shed sat down on a block of wood in the midst of us and asked if any one had been sick if we had got our clothes clean and if we had been supplied with an allowance of rice corn and butter After satisfying himself upon these points he told us that we were now at liberty to run away if we chose to do so but if we made the attempt we should most certainly be re-taken and subjected to the most terrible punishment I never flog he My practice is to cat-haul and if you run away and I catch you again--as I surely shall do--and give you one cat-hauling you will never run away again nor attempt it I did not then understand the import of cat-hauling but in after times became well acquainted with its signification We remained in this place nearly two weeks during which time our allowance of food was not varied and was regularly given to us We were not required to do any work and I had liberty and leisure to walk about the plantation and make such observations as I could upon the new state of things around me Gentlemen and ladies came every day to look at us with a view of becoming our purchasers and we were examined with minute care as to our ages former occupations and capacity of performing labour Our persons were inspected and more especially the hands were scrutinized to see if all the fingers were perfect and capable of the quick motions necessary in picking cotton Our master only visited us once a day and sometimes he remained absent two days so that he seldom met any of those who came to see us but whenever it so happened that he did meet them he laid aside his silence and became very talkative and even animated in his conversation extolling our good qualities and averring that he had purchased some of us of one colonel and others of another general in Virginia that he could by no means have procured us had it not been that in some instances our masters had ruined themselves and were obliged to sell us to save their families from ruin and in others that our owners were dead their estates deeply in debt and we had been sold at public sale by which means he had become possessed of us He our habits were unexceptionable our characters good and that there was not one amongst us all who had ever been known to run away or steal any thing from our former masters I observed that running away and stealing from his master were regarded as the highest crimes of which a slave could be guilty but I heard no questions asked concerning our propensity to steal from other people besides our masters and I afterwards learned that this was not always regarded as a very high crime by the owner of a slave provided he would perpetrate the theft so adroitly as not to be detected in it We were severally asked by our visiters if we would be willing to live with them if they would purchase us to which we generally replied in the affirmative but our owner declined all the offers that were made for us upon the ground that we were too poor--looked too bad to be sold at present--and that in our condition he could not expect to get a fair value for us One evening when our master was with us a thin sallow-looking man rode up to the house and alighting from his horse came to us and told him that he had come to buy a boy that he wished to get a good field hand and would pay a good price for him I never saw a human countenance that expressed more of the evil passions of the heart than did that of this man and his conversation corresponded with his physiognomy Every sentence of his language was accompanied with an oath of the most vulgar profanity and his eyes appeared to me to be the index of a soul as cruel as his visage was disgusting and repulsive After looking at us for some time this wretch singled me out as the object of his choice and coming up to me asked me how I would like him for a master In my heart I detested him but a slave is often afraid to speak the truth and divulge all he feels so with myself in this instance as it was doubtful whether I might not fall into his hands and be subject to the violence of his temper I told him that if he was a good master as every gentleman ought to be I should be willing to live with him He appeared satisfied with my answer and turning to my master he would give a high price for me I can he by going to Charleston buy as many Guinea negroes as I please for two hundred dollars each but as I like this fellow I will give you four hundred for him This offer struck terror into my very heart for I knew it was as much as was generally given for the best and ablest slaves and I expected that it would immediately be accepted as my price and that I should be at once consigned to the hands of this man of whom I had formed so abhorrent an opinion To my surprise and satisfaction however my master made no reply to the proposition but stood for a moment with one hand raised to his face and his fore-finger on his nose and then turning suddenly to me Charles go into the house I shall not sell you to-day It was my business to obey the order of departure and as I went beyond the sound of their voices I could not understand the purport of the conversation which followed between these two traffickers in human blood but after a parley of about a quarter of an hour the hated stranger started abruptly away and going to the road mounted his horse and rode off at a gallop banishing himself and my fears together I did not see my master again this evening and when I came out of our barracks in the morning although it was scarcely daylight I saw him standing near one corner of the building with his head inclined towards the wall evidently listening to catch any sounds within He ordered me to go and feed his horse and have him saddled for him by sunrise About an hour afterwards he came to the stable in his riding dress and told me that he should remove us all to Columbia in a few days He then rode away and did not return until the third day afterwards VII IT was now about the middle of June the weather excessively warm and from eleven o'clock A M until late in the afternoon the sand about our residence was so hot that we could not stand on it with our bare feet in one posture more than one or two minutes The whole country so far as I could see appeared to be a dead plain without the least variety of either hill or dale The pine was so far the predominating timber of the forest that at a little distance the entire woods appeared to be composed of this tree I had become weary of being confined to the immediate vicinity of our lodgings and determined to venture out into the fields of the plantation and see the manner of cultivating cotton Accordingly after I had made my morning meal upon corn cakes I sallied out in the direction which I had seen the slaves of the plantation take at the time they left the house at daylight and following a path through a small field of corn which was so tall as to prevent me from seeing beyond it I soon arrived at the field in which the people were at work with hoes amongst the cotton which was about two feet and a half high and had formed such long branches that they could no longer plough in it without breaking it Expecting to pass the remainder of my life in this kind of labour I felt anxious to know the evils if any attending it and more especially the manner in which the slaves wore treated or the cotton estates The people now before me were all diligently and laboriously weeding and hilling the cotton with hoes and when I approached them they scarcely took time to speak to me but continued their labour as if I had not been present As there did not appear to be any overseer with them I thought I would go amongst them and enter into conversation with them but upon addressing myself to one of the men and telling him if it was not disagreeable to him I should be glad to become acquainted with him he he should be glad to be acquainted with me but master Tom did not allow him to talk much to people when he was at work I asked him where his master Tom was but before he had time to reply some one called--Mind your work there you rascals Looking in the direction of the sound I saw master Tom sitting under the shade of a sassafras tree at the distance of about a hundred yards from us Deeming it unsafe to continue in the field without the permission of its lord I approached the sassafras tree with my hat in my hand and in a very humble manner asked leave to help the people work awhile as I was tired of staying about the house and doing nothing He he did not care I might go and work with th m awhile but I must take care not to talk too much and keep his hands from their work Now having authority on my side I returned and taking a hoe from the hands of a small girl told her to pull up weeds and I would take her row for her When we arrived at the end of the rows which we were then hilling master Tom who still held his post under the sassafras tree called his people to come to breakfast Although I had already broken my fast I went with the rest for the purpose of seeing what their breakfast was composed of At the tree I saw a keg which contained about five gallons with water in it and a gourd lying by it near this was a basket made of splits large enough to hold more than a peck It contained the breakfast of the people covered by some green leaves of the magnolia or great bay tree of the south When the leaves were removed I found that the supply of provisions consisted of one cake of corn meal weighing about half a pound for each person This bread had no sort of seasoning not even salt and constituted the only breakfast of these poor people who had been toiling from early dawn until about eight o'clock There was no cake for me and master Tom did not say any thing to me on the state of my stomach but the young girl whose hoe I had taken in the field offered me a part of her cake which I refused After the breakfast was despatched we again returned to our work but the master ordered the girl whose hoe I had to go and get another hoe which lay at some distance in the field and take her row again I continued in the field until dinner which took place about one o'clock and was the same in all respects as the breakfast had been Master Tom was the younger of the two brothers who returned from the cook-fight on the evening of our arrival at this place--he left the field about ten o'clock and was succeeded by his elder brother as overseer for the remainder of the day After this change of superintendents my companions became more loquacious and in the course of an hour or two I had become familiar with the condition of my fellow-labourers who told me that the elder of their young masters was much less tyrannical than his younger brother and that whilst the former remained in the field they would be at liberty to talk as much as they pleased provided they did not neglect their work One of the men who appeared to be about forty years of age and who was the foreman of the field told me that he had been born in South Carolina and had always lived there though he had only belonged to his present master about ten years I asked him if his master allowed him no meat nor any kind of provisions except bread to which he replied that they never had any meat except at Christmas when each hand on the place received about three pounds of pork that from September when the sweet potatoes were at the maturity of their growth they had an allowance of potatoes as long as the crop held out which was generally until about March but that for the rest of the year they had nothing but a peck of corn a week with such weeds and other vegetables as they could gather from the fields for greens--that their master did not allow them any salt and that the only means they had of procuring this luxury was by work ng on Sundays for the neigbouring planters who paid them in money at the rate of fifty cents per day with which they purchased salt and some other articles of convenience This man told me that his master furnished him with two shirts of tow linen and two pair of trousers one of woollen and the other of linen cloth one woollen jacket and one blanket every year That he received the woollen clothes at Christmas and the linen at Easter and all the other clothes if he had any he was obliged to provide for himself by working on Sunday He that for several years past he had not been able to provide any clothes for himself as he had a wife with several small children on an adjoining plantation whose master gave only one suit of clothes in the year to the mother and none of any kind to the children which had compelled him to lay out all his savings in providing clothes for his family and such little necessaries as were called for by his wife from time to time He had not had a shoe on his foot for several years but in winter made a kind of moccasin for himself of the bark of a tree which he was abundant in the swamps and could be so manufactured as to make good ropes and tolerable moccasins sufficient at least to defend the feet from the frost though not to keep them dry The old man whom I have alluded to before was in the field with the others though he was not able to keep up his row He had no clothes on him except the remains of an old shirt which hung in tatters from his neck and arms the two young girls had nothing on them but petticoats made of coarse tow cloth and the woman who was the mother of the children wore the remains of a tow linen shift the front part of which was entirely gone but a piece of old cotton bagging tied round her loins served the purposes of an apron The younger of the two boys was entirely naked The man who was foreman of the field was a person of good sense for the condition of life in which fortune had placed him and spoke to me freely of his hard lot I observed that under his shirt which was very ragged he wore a piece of fine linen cloth apparently part of an old shirt wrapped closely round his back and confined in front by strings tied down his breast I asked him why be wore that piece of gentleman's linen under his shirt and shall give his reply in his own words as well as I can recollect them at a distance of near thirty years I have always been a hard working man and have suffered a great deal from hunger in my time It is not possible for a man to work hard every day for several months and get nothing but a peck of corn a week to eat and not feel hungry When a man is hungry you know if you have ever been hungry he must eat whatever he can get I have not tasted meat since last Christmas and we have had to work uncommonly hard this summer Master has a flock of sheep that run in the woods and they come every night to sleep in the lane near the house Two weeks ago last Saturday when we quit work at night I was very hungry and as we went to the house we passed along the lane where the sheep lay There were nearly fifty of them and some were very fat The temptation was more than I could bear I caught one of them cut its head off with the hoe that I carried on my shoulder and threw it under the fence About midnight when all was still about the house I went out with a knife took the sheep into the woods and dressed it by the light of the moon The carcass I took home and after cutting it up placed it in the great kettle over a good fire intending to boil it and divide it when cooked between my fellow-slaves whom I knew to be as hungry as I was and myself Unfortunately for me master Tom who had been out amongst his friends that day had not returned at bed-time and about one o'clock in the morning at the time when I had a blazing fire under the kettle I heard the sound of the feet of a horse coming along the lane The kitchen walls were open so that the light of my fire could not be concealed and in a moment I heard the horse blowing at the front of the house Conscious of my danger I stripped my shirt from my back and pushed it into the boiling kettle so as wholly to conceal the flesh of the sheep I had scarcely completed this act of precaution when master Tom burst into the kitchen and with a terrible oath asked me what I was doing so late at night with a great fire in the kitchen I replied 'I am going to wash my shirt master and am boiling it to get it clean' 'Washing your shirt at this time of night' he 'I will let you know that you are not to sit up all night and be lazy and good for nothing all day There shall be no boiling of shirts here on Sunday morning' and thrusting his cane into the kettle he raised my shirt out and threw it on the kitchen floor He did not at first observe the mutton which rose to the surface of the water as soon as the shirt was removed but after giving the shirt a kick towards the door he again turned his face to the fire and seeing a leg standing several inches out of the pot he demanded of me what I had in there and where I had got this meat Finding that I was detected and that the whole matter must be discovered I --'Master I am hungry and am cooking my supper' 'What is it you have in here' 'A sheep' I and as the words were uttered he knocked me down with his cane and after beating me severely ordered me to cross my hands until he bound me fast with a rope that hung in the kitchen and answered the double purpose of a clothes' line and a cord to tie us with when we were to be whipped He put out the fire under the kettle drew me into the yard tied me fast to the mill-post and leaving me there for the night went and called one of the negro boys to put his horse in the stable and went to his bed The cord was bound so tightly round my wrists that before morning the blood had burst out under my finger nails but I suppose my master slept soundly for all that I was afraid to call any one to come and release me from my torment lest a still more terrible punishment might overtake me I was permitted to remain in this situation until long after sunrise the next morning which being Sunday was quiet and still my fellow-slaves being permitted to take their rest after the severe toil of the past week and my old master and two young ones having no occasion to rise to call the hands to the field did not think of interrupting their morning slumbers to release me from my painful confinement However when the sun was risen about an hour I heard the noise of persons moving in the great house and soon after a loud and boisterous conversation which I well knew portended no good to me At length they all three came into the yard where I lay lashed to the post and approaching me my old master asked me if I had any accomplices in stealing the sheep I told them none--that it was entirely my own act--and that none of my fellow-slaves had any hand in it This was the truth but if any of my companions had been concerned with me I should not have betrayed them for such an act of treachery could not have alleviated the dreadful punishment which I knew awaited me and would only have involved them in the same misery They called me a thief loaded me with oaths and imprecations and each one proposed the punishment which he deemed the most appropriate to the enormity of the crime that I had committed Master Tom was of opinion that I should be lashed to the post at the foot of which I lay and that each of my fellow slaves should be compelled to give me a dozen lashes in turn with a roasted and greased hickory gad until I had received in the whole two hundred and fifty lashes on my bare back and that he would stand by with the whip in his hand and compel them not to spare me but after a short debate this was given up as it would probably render me unable to work in the field again for several weeks My master Ned was in favour of giving me a dozen lashes every morning for a month with the whip but my old master this would be attended with too much trouble and besides it would keep me from my work at least half an hour every morning and proposed in his turn that I should not be whipped at all but that the carcass of the sheep should be taken from the kettle in its half-boiled condition and hung up in the kitchen loft without salt and that I should be compelled to subsist on this putrid mutton without any other food until it should be consumed This suggestion met the approbation of my young masters and would have been adopted had not mistress at this moment come into the yard and hearing the intended punishment loudly objected to it because the mutton would in a day or two create such an offensive stench that she and my young mistresses would not be able to remain in the house My mistress swore dreadfully and cursed me for an ungrateful sheep thief who after all her kindness in giving me soup and warm bread when I was sick last winter was always stealing every thing I could get hold of She then to my master that such villany ought not to be passed over in a slight manner and that as crimes such as this concerned the whole country my punishment ought to be public for the purpose of example and advised him to have me whipped that same afternoon at five o'clock first giving notice to the planters of the neighbourhood to come and see the spectacle and to bring with them their slaves that they might be witnesses to the consequences of stealing sheep They then returned to the house to breakfast but as the pain in my hands and arms produced by the ligatures of the cord with which I was bound was greater than I could bear I now felt exceedingly sick and lost all knowledge of my situation They told me I fainted and when I recovered my faculties I found myself lying in the shade of the house with my hands free and all the white persons in my master's family standing around me As soon as I was able to stand the rope was tied round my neck and the other end again fastened to the mill post My mistress I had only pretended to faint and master Tom I would have something worth fainting for before night He was faithful to his promise but for the present I was suffered to sit on the grass in the shade of the house As soon as breakfast was over my two young masters had their horses saddled and set out to give notice to their friends of what had happened and to invite them to come and see me punished for the crime I had committed My mistress gave me no breakfast and when I begged one of the black boys whom I saw looking at me through the pales to bring me some water in a gourd to drink she ordered him to bring it from a puddle in the lane My mistress had always been very cruel to all her black people I remained in this situation until about eleven o'clock when one of my young mistresses came to me and gave me a piece of jonny-cake about the size of my hand perhaps larger than my hand telling me at the same time that my fellow-slaves had been permitted to re-boil the mutton that I had left in the kettle and make their breakfast of it but that her mother would not allow her to give me any part of it It was well for them that I had parboiled it with my shirt and so defiled it that it was unfit for the table of my master otherwise no portion of it would have fallen to the black people--as it was they had as much meat as they could consume in two days for which I had to suffer About twelve o'clock one of my young masters returned and soon afterwards the other came home I heard them tell my old master that they had been round to give notice of my offence to the neighbouring planters and that several of them would attend to see me flogged and would bring with them some of their slaves who m be able to report to their companions what had been done to me for stealing It was late in the afternoon before any of the gentlemen came but before five o'clock there were more than twenty white people and at least fifty black ones present the latter of whom had been compelled by their masters to come and see me punished Amongst others an overseer from a neighbouring estate attended and to him was awarded the office of executioner I was stripped of my shirt and the waist-band of my trousers was drawn closely round me below my hips so as to expose the whole of my back in its entire length It seems that it had been determined to beat me with thongs of raw cow-hide for the overseer had two of these in his hands each about four feet long but one of the gentlemen present this might bruise my back so badly that I could not work for some time perhaps not for a week or two and as I could not be spared from the field without great disadvantage to my master's crop he suggested a different plan by which in his opinion the greatest degree of pain could be inflicted on me with the least danger of rendering me unable to work As he was a large planter and had more than fifty slaves all were disposed to be guided by his counsels and my master he would submit the matter entirely to him as a man of judgment and experience in such cases He then desired my master to have a dozen pods of red pepper boiled in half a gallon of water and desired the overseer to lay aside his thongs of raw hide and put a new cracker of silk to the lash of his negro whip Whilst these preparations were being made each of my thumbs was lashed closely to the end of a stick about three feet long and a chair being placed beside the mill post I was compelled to raise my hands and place the stick to which my thumbs were bound over the top of the post which is about eighteen inches square the chair was then taken from under me and I was left hanging by the thumbs with my face towards the post and my feet about a foot from the ground My two great toes were then tied together and drawn down the post as far as my joints could be stretched the cord was passed round the post two or three times and securely fastened In this posture I had no power of motion except in my neck and could only move that at the expense of beating my face against the side of the post The pepper tea was now brought and poured into a basin to cool and the overseer was desired to give me a dozen lashes just above the waist-band and not to cover a space of more than four inches on my back from the waist-band upwards He obeyed the injunction faithfully but slowly and each crack of the whip was followed by a sensation as painful as if a red hot iron had been drawn across my back When the twelve strokes had been given the operation was suspended and a black man one of the slaves present was compelled to wash the gashes in my skin with the scalding pepper tea which was yet so hot that he could not hold his hand in it This doubly-burning liquid was thrown into my raw and bleeding wounds and produced a tormenting smart beyond the description of language After a delay of ten minutes by the watch I received another dozen lashes on the part of my back which was immediately above the bleeding and burning gashes of the former whipping and again the biting stinging pepper tea was applied to my lacerated and trembling muscles This operation was continued at regular intervals until I had received ninety-six lashes and my back was cut and scalded from end to end Every stroke of the whip had drawn blood many of the gashes were three inches long my back burned as if it had been covered by a coat of hot embers mixed with living coals and I felt my flesh quiver like that of animals that I slaughtered by the butcher and are flayed whilst yet half alive My face was bruised and my nose bled profusely for in the madness of my agony I had not been able to refrain from beating my head violently against the post Vainly did I beg and implore for mercy I was kept bound to the post with my whole weight hanging upon my thumbs an hour and a half but it appeared to me that I had entered upon eternity and that my sufferings would never end At length however my feet were unbound and afterwards my hands but when released from the cords I was so far exhausted as not to be able to stand and my thumbs were stiff and motionless I was carried into the kitchen and laid on a blanket where my ss came to see me and after looking at my lacerated back and telling me that my wounds were only skin deep I had come off well after what I had done and that I ought to be thankful that it was not worse with me She then bade me not to groan so loud nor make so much noise and left me to myself I lay in this condition until it was quite dark by which time the burning of my back had much abated and was succeeded by an aching soreness which rendered me unable to turn over or bend my spine in the slightest manner My mistress again visited me and brought with her about half a pound of fat bacon which she made one of the black women roast before the fire on a fork until the oil ran freely from it and then rub it warm over my back This was repeated until I was greased from the neck to the hips effectually An old blanket was then thrown over me and I was left to pass the night alone Such was the terror stricken into my fellow-slaves by the example made of me that although they loved and pitied me not one of them dared to approach me during this night My strength was gone and I at length fell asleep from which I did not awake until the horn was blown the next morning to call the people to the corn crib to receive their weekly allowance of a peck of corn I did not rise nor attempt to join the other people and shortly afterwards my master entered the kitchen and in a soft and gentle tone of voice asked me if I was dead I answered him that I was not dead and making some effort found I was able to get upon my feet My master had become frightened when he missed me at the corn crib and being suddenly seized with an apprehension that I was dead his heart had become softened not with compassion for my sufferings but with the fear of losing his best field hand but when he saw me stand before him erect and upright the recollection of the lost sheep revived in his mind and with it all his feelings of revenge against the author of its death 'So you are not dead yet you thieving rascal' he and cursing me with many bitter oaths ordered me to go along to the crib and get my corn and go to work with the rest of the hands I was forced to obey and taking my basket of corn from the door of the crib placed it in the kitchen loft and went to the field with the other people Weak and exhausted as I was I was compelled to do the work of an able hand but was not permitted to taste the mutton which was all given to the others who were carefully guarded whilst they were eating lest they should give me some of it This man's back was not yet well Many of the gashes made by the lash were yet sore and those that were healed had left long white stripes across his body He had no notion of leaving the service of his tyrannical master and his spirit was so broken and subdued that he was ready to suffer and to bear all his hardships not indeed without complaining but without attempting to resist his oppressors or to escape from their power I saw him often whilst I remained at this place and ventured to tell him once that if I had a master who would abuse me as his had abused him I would run away Where could I run or in what place could I conceal myself he I have known many slaves who ran away but they were always caught and treated worse afterwards than they had been before I have heard that there is a place called Philadelphia where the black people are all free but I do not know which way it lies nor what road I should take to go there and if I knew the way how could I hope to get there would not the patrol be sure to catch me I pitied this unfortunate creature and was at the same time fearful that in a short time I should be equally the object of pity myself How well my fears were justified the sequel of my narrative will show VIII We had been stationed in the old cotton-gin house about twenty days had recovered from the fatigues of our journey and were greatly improved our strength and appearance when our master returned one evening after an absence of two days and told us that we must go to Columbia the next day and must for this purpose have our breakfast ready by sunrise On the following morning he called us at daylight and we made all despatch in preparing our morning repast the last that we were to take in our present residence As our equipments consisted of the few clothes we had on our persons and a solitary blanket to each individual our baggage was easily adjusted and we were on the road before the sun was up half an hour and in less than an hour we were in Columbia drawn up in a long line in the street opposite the court-house The town which was small and mean looking was full of people and I believe that more than a thousand gentlemen came to look at us within the course of this day We were kept in the street about an hour and were then taken into the jail-yard and permitted to sit down but were not shut up in the jail The court was sitting in Columbia at this time and either this circumstance or the intelligence of our arrival in the country or both had drawn together a very great crowd of people We were supplied with victuals by the jailer and had a small allowance of salt pork for dinner We slept in the jail at night and as none of us had been sold on the day of our arrival in Columbia and we had not heard any of the persons who came to look at us make proposals to our master for our purchase I supposed it might be his intention to drive us still farther south before he offered us for sale but I discovered my error on the second day which was Tuesday This day the crowd in town was much greater than it had been on Monday and about ten o'clock our master came into the yard in company with the jailer and after looking at us some time the latter addressed us in a short speech which continued perhaps five minutes In this harangue he told us we had come to live in the finest country in the world that South Carolina was the richest and best part of the United States and that he was going to sell us to gentlemen who would make us all very happy and would require us to do no hard work but only raise cotton and pick it He then ordered a handsome young lad about eighteen years of age to follow him into the street where we observed a great concourse of persons collected Here the jailer made another harangue to the multitude in which he assured them that he was just about to sell the most valuable lot of slaves that had ever been offered in Columbia That we were all young in excellent health of good habits having been all purchased in Virginia from the estates of tobacco planters and that there was not one in the whole lot who had lost the use of a single finger or was blind of an eye He then cried the poor lad for sale and the first bid he received was two hundred dollars Others quickly succeeded and the boy who was a remarkably handsome youth was striken off in a few minutes to a young man who appeared not much older than himself at three hundred and fifty dollars The purchaser paid down his price to our master on a table in the jail and the lad after bidding us farewell followed his new master with tears running down his cheeks He next sold a young girl about fifteen or sixteen years old for two hundred and fifty dollars to a lady who attended the sales in her carriage and made her bids out of the window In this manner the sales were continued for about two hours and a half when they were adjourned until three o'clock In the afternoon they were again resumed and kept open until about five o'clock when they were closed for the day As my companions were sold they were taken from amongst us and we saw them no more The next morning before day I was awakened from my sleep by the sound of several heavy fires of cannon which were discharged as it seemed to me within a few yards of the place where I lay These were succeeded by fifes and drums and all the noise with which I had formerly heard the fourth of July ushered in at the navy-yard in Washington Since I had left Maryland I had carefully kept the reckoning of the days of the week but had not been careful to note the dates of the month yet as soon as daylight appeared and the door of our apartment was opened I inquired and learned that this was as I had supposed it to be the day of universal rejoicing I understood that the court did not sit this day but a great crowd of people gathered and remained around the jail all the morning many of whom were intoxicated and sang and shouted in honour of free government and the rights of man About eleven o'clock a long table was spread under a row of trees which grew in the street not far from the jail and which appeared to me to be of the kind called in Pennsylvania the pride of China At this table several hundred persons sat down to dinner soon after noon and continued to eat and drink and sing songs in honour of liberty for more than two hours At the end of the dinner a gentleman rose and stood upon his chair near one end of the table and begged the company to hear him for a few minutes He informed them that he was a candidate for some office--but what office it was I do not recollect--and that as it was an acknowledged principle of our free government that all men were born free and equal he presumed it would not be deemed an act of arrogance in him to call upon them for their votes at the coming election This first speaker was succeeded by another who addressed his audience in nearly the same language and after he had concluded the company broke up I heard a black man that belonged to the jailer or who was at least in his service say that there had been a great meeting that morning in the court house at which several gentlemen had made speeches When I lived at the navy-yard the officers sometimes permitted me to go up town with them on the fourth of July and listen to the fine speeches that were made there on such occasions About five o'clock the jailer came and stood at the front door of the jail and proclaimed in a very loud voice that a sale of most valuable slaves would immediately take place that he had sold many fine hands yesterday but they were only the refuse and most worthless part of the whole lot--that those who wished to get great bargains and prime property had better attend now as it was certain that such negroes had never been offered for sale in Columbia before In a few minutes the whole assembly that had composed the dinner party and hundreds of others were convened around the jail door and the jailer again proceeded with his auction Several of the stoutest men and handsomest women in the whole company had been reserved for this day and I perceived that the very best of us were kept back for the last We went off at rather better prices than had been obtained on the former day and I perceived much eagerness amongst the bidders many of whom were not sober Within less than three hours only three of us remained in the jail and we were ordered to come and stand at the door in front of the crier who made a most extravagant eulogium upon our good qualities and capacity to perform labour He These three fellows are as strong as horses and as patient as mules one of them can do as much work as two common men and they are perfectly honest Mr M'Giffin says he was assured by their former masters that they were never known to steal or run away They must bring good prices gentlemen or they will not be sold Their master is determined that if they do not bring six hundred dollars he will not sell them but will take them to Georgia next summer and sell them to some of the new settlers These boys can do any thing This one referring to me can cut five cords of wood in a day and put it up He is a rough carpenter and a first rate field hand This one laying his hand on the shoulder of one of my companions is a blacksmith and can lay a ploughshare put new steel upon an axe or mend a broken chain The other he recommended as a good shoemaker and well acquainted with the process of tanning leather We were all nearly of the same age and very stout healthy robust young men in full possession of our corporal powers and if we had been shut up in a room with ten of the strongest of those who had assembled to purchase us and our liberty had depended on tying them fast to each other I have no doubt that we should have been free if ropes had been provided for us After a few minutes of hesitancy amongst the purchasers and a closer examination of our persons than had been made in the jail-yard an elderly gentleman he would take the carpenter and the blacksmith and shoemaker were immediately taken by others at the required price It was now sundown The heat of the day had been very oppressive and I was glad to be released from the confined air of the jail and the hot atmosphere in which so many hundreds were breathing My new master asked me my name and ordered me to follow him We proceeded to a tavern where a great number of persons were assembled at a short distance from the jail My master entered the house and joined in the conversation of the party in which the utmost hilarity prevailed They were drinking toasts in honour of liberty and independence over glasses of toddy a liquor composed of a mixture of rum water sugar and nutmeg It was ten o'clock at night before my master and his companions had finished their toasts and toddy and all this time I had been standing before the door or sitting on a log of wood that lay in front of the house At one time I took a seat on a bench at the side of the house but was soon driven from this position by a gentleman in military clothes with a large gilt epaulet on each shoulder and a profusion of glittering buttons on his coat who passing near me in the dark and happening to cast his eye on me demanded of me in an imperious tone how I dared to sit on that seat I told him I was a stranger and did not know that it was wrong to sit there He then ordered me with an oath to begone from there and if he caught me on that bench again he would cut my head off Did you not see white people sit upon that bench you saucy rascal he I assured him I had not seen any white gentleman sit on the bench as it was near night when I came to the house that I had not intended to be saucy or misbehave myself and that I hoped he would not be angry with me as my master had left me at the door and had not told me where I was to sit I remained on the log until the termination of the festival in honour of liberty and equality when my master came to the door and observed in my hearing to some of his friends that they had celebrated the day in a handsome manner No person except the military gentleman had spoken to me since I came to the house in the evening with my master who seemed to have forgotten me for he remained at the door warmly engaged in conversation on various political subjects a full hour after he rose from the toast party At length however I heard him say--I bought a negro this evening--I wonder where he is Rising immediately from the log on which I had been so long seated I presented myself before him and Here master He then ordered me to go to the kitchen of the inn and go to sleep but nothing to me about supper I retired to the kitchen where I found a large number of servants who belonged to the house and amongst them two young girls who had been purchased by a gentleman who lived near Augusta and who they told me intended to set out for his plantation the next morning and take them with him These girls had been sold out of our company on the first day and had been living in the tavern kitchen since that time They appeared quite contented and evinced no repugnance to setting out the next morning for their master's plantation They were of that order of people who never look beyond the present day and so long as they had plenty of victuals in this kitchen they did not trouble themselves with reflections upon the cotton field One of the servants gave me some cold meat and a piece of wheaten bread which was the first I had tasted since I left Maryland and indeed it was the last that I tasted until I reached Maryland again I here met with a man who was born and brought up in the Northern Neck of Virginia on the banks of the Potomac and within a few miles of my native place We soon formed an acquaintance and sat up nearly all night He was the chief hostler in the stable of this tavern and told me that he had often thought of attempting to escape and return to Virginia He he had little doubt of being able to reach the Potomac but having no knowledge of the country beyond that river he was afraid that he should not be able to make his way to Philadelphia which he regarded as the only place in which he could be safe from the pursuit of his master I was myself then young and my knowledge of the country north of Baltimore was very vague and undefined I however told him that I had heard that if a black man could reach any part of Pennsylvania he would be beyond the reach of his pursuers He he could not justly complain of want of food but the services required of him were so unreasonable and the punishment frequently inflicted upon him so severe that he was determined to set out for the north as soon as the corn was so far ripe as to be fit to be roasted He felt confident that by lying in the woods and unfrequented places all day and travelling only by night he could escape the vigilance of all pursuit and gain the Northern Neck before the corn would be gathered from the fields He had no fear of wanting food as be could live well on roasting ears as long as the corn was in the milk and afterwards on parched corn as long as the grain remained in the field I advised him as well as I could as to the best means of reaching the state of Pennsylvania but was not able to give him any very definite instructions This man possessed a very sound understanding and having been five years in Carolina was well acquainted with the country He gave me such an account of the sufferings of the slaves on the cotton and indigo plantations--of whom I now regarded myself as one--that I was unable to sleep any this night From the resolute manner in which he spoke of his intended elopement and the regularity with which he had connected the various combinations of the enterprise I have no doubt that he undertook that which he intended to perform Whether he was successful or not in the enterprise I cannot say as I never saw him nor heard of him after the next morning This man certainly communicated to me the outlines of the plan which I afterwards put in execution and by which I gained my liberty at the expense of sufferings which none can appreciate except those who have borne all that the stoutest human constitution can bear of cold and hunger toil and pain The conversation of this slave aroused in my breast so many recollections of the past and fears of the future that I did not lie down but sat on an old chair until daylight From the people of the kitchen I again received some cold victuals for my breakfast but I did not see my master until about nine o'clock the toddy of the last evening causing him to sleep late this morning At length a female slave gave me notice that my master wished to see me in the dining room whither I repaired without a moment's delay When I entered the room he was sitting near the window smoking a pipe with a very long handle--I believe more than two feet in length He asked no questions but addressing me by the title of boy ordered me to go with the hostler of the inn and get his horse and chaise ready As soon as this order could be executed I informed him that his chaise was at the door and we immediately commenced our journey to the plantation of my master which he told me lay at the distance of twenty miles from Columbia He I must keep up with him and as he drove at the rate of five or six miles an hour I was obliged to run nearly half the time but I was then young and could easily travel fifty or sixty miles in a day It was with great anxiety that I looked for the place which was in future to be my home but this did not prevent me from making such observations upon the state of the country through which we travelled as the rapidity of our march permitted This whole region had originally been one vast wilderness of pine forest except the low grounds and river bottoms here called swamps in which all the varieties of trees shrubs vines and plants peculiar to such places in southern latitudes vegetated in unrestrained luxuriance Nor is pine the only timber that grows on the uplands in this part of Carolina although it is the predominant tree and in some places prevails to the exclusion of every other--oak hickory sassafras and many others are found Here also I first observed groves of the most beautiful of all the trees of the wood--the great Southern Magnolia or Green Bay No adequate conception can be formed of the appearance or the fragrance of this most magnificent tree by any one who has not seen it or scented the air when tainted by the perfume of its flowers It rises in a right line to the height of seventy or eighty feet the stem is of a delicate taper form and casts off numerous branches in nearly right angles with itself the extremities of which decline gently towards the ground and become shorter and shorter in the ascent until at the apex of the tree they are scarcely a foot in length whilst below they are many times found twenty feet long The immense cones formed by these trees are as perfect as those diminutive forms which nature exhibits in the bur of the pine tree The leaf of the magnolia is smooth of an oblong taper form about six inches in length and half as broad Its colour is the deepest and purest green The foliage of the Bay tree is as impervious as a brick wall to the rays of the sun and its coolness in the heat of a summer day affords one of the greatest luxuries of a cotton plantation It blooms in May and bears great numbers of broad expanded white flowers the odour of which is exceedingly grateful and so abundant that I have no doubt that a grove of these trees in full bloom may be smelled at a distance of fifteen or twenty miles I have heard it asserted in the south that their scent has been perceived by persons fifty or sixty miles from them This tree is one of nature's most splendid and in the climate where she has placed it one of her most agreeable productions It is peculiar to the southern temperate latitudes and cannot bear the rigours of a northern winter though I have heard that groves of the Bay are found on Fishing Creek in Western Virginia not far from Wheeling and near the Ohio river Could this tree be naturalized in Pennsylvania it would form an ornament to her towns cities and country seats at once the most tasteful and the most delicious A forest of these trees in the month of May resembles a wood enveloped in an untimely fall of snow at midsummer glowing in the rays of a morning sun We passed this day through cotton fields and pine woods alternately but the scene was sometimes enlivened by the appearance of lots of corn and sweet potatoes which I observed were generally planted near the houses I afterwards learned that this custom of planting the corn and potatoes near the house of the planter is general over all Carolina The object is to prevent the slaves from stealing and thus procuring more food than by the laws of the plantation they are entitled to In passing through a lane I this day saw a field which appeared to me to contain about fifty acres in which people were at work with hoes amongst a sort of plants that I had never seen before I asked my master what this was and he told me it was indigo I shall have occasion to say more of this plant hereafter We at length arrived at the residence of my master who descended from his chaise and leaving me in charge of the horse at the gate proceeded to the house across a long court yard In a few minutes two young ladies and a young gentleman came out of the house and walked to the gate near which I was with the horse One of the ladies they had come to look at me and see what kind of a boy her pa had brought home with him The other one I was a very smart looking boy and this compliment flattered me greatly they being the first kind words that had been addressed to me since I left Maryland The young gentleman asked me if I could run fast and if I had ever picked cotton His manner did not impress me so much in his favour as the address of his sister had done for her These three young persons were the son and daughters of my master After looking at me a short time my young master for so I must now call him ordered me to take the harness from the horse give him water at a well which was near and come into the kitchen where some boiled rice was given me for my dinner I was not required to go to work this first day of my abode in my new residence but after I had eaten my rice my young master told me I might rest myself or walk out and see the plantation but that I must be ready to go with the overseer the next morning IX By the laws of the United States I am still a slave and though I am now growing old I might even yet be deemed of sufficient value to be worth pursuing as far as my present residence if those to whom the law gives the right of dominion over my person and life knew where to find me For these reasons I have been advised by those whom I believe to be my friends not to disclose the true names of any of those families in which I was a slave in Carolina or Georgia lest this narrative should meet their eyes and in some way lead them to a discovery of my retreat I was now the slave of one of the most wealthy planters in Carolina who planted cotton rice indigo corn and potatoes and was the master of two hundred and sixty slaves The description of one great cotton plantation will give a correct idea of all others and I shall here present an outline of that of my master He lived about two miles from Caugaree river which bordered his estate on one side and in the swamps of which were his rice fields The country hereabout is very flat the banks of the river are low and in wet seasons large tracts of country are flooded by the superabundant water of the river There are no springs and the only means of procuring water on the plantations is from wells which must be sunk in general about twenty feet deep before a constant supply of water can be obtained My master had two of these wells on his plantation one at the mansion house and one at the quarter My master's house was of brick brick houses are by no means common amongst the planters whose residences are generally built of frame work weather boarded with pine boards and covered with shingles of the white cedar or juniper cypress and contained two large parlours and a spacious hall or entry on the ground floor The main building was two stories high and attached to this was a smaller building one story and a half high with a large room where the family generally took breakfast with a kitchen at the farther extremity from the main building There was a spacious garden behind the house containing I believe about five acres well cultivated and handsomely laid out In this garden grew a great variety of vegetables some of which I have never seen in the market of Philadelphia It contained a profusion of flowers three different shrubberies a vast number of ornamental and small fruit trees and several small hot houses with glass roofs There was a head gardener who did nothing but attend to this garden through the year and during the summer he generally had two men and two boys to assist him In the months of April and May this garden was one of the sweetest and most pleasant places that I ever was in At one end of the main building was a small house called the library in which my master kept his books and papers and where he spent much of his time At some distance from the mansion was a pigeon house and near the kitchen was a large wooden building called the kitchen quarter in which the house servants slept and where they generally took their meals Here also the washing of the family was done and all the rough or unpleasant work of the kitchen department--such as cleaning and salting fish putting up pork c was assigned to this place There was no barn on this plantation according to the acceptation of the word barn in Pennsylvania but there was a wooden building about forty feet long called the coach-house in one end of which the family carriage and the chaise in which my master rode were kept Under the same roof was a stable sufficiently capacious to contain ten or twelve horses In one end of the building the corn intended for the horses was kept and the whole of the loft or upper story was occupied by the fodder or blades and tops of the corn About a quarter of a mile from the dwelling-house were the huts or cabins of the plantation slaves or field hands standing in rows much like the Indian villages which I have seen in the country of the Cherokees These cabins were thirty-eight in number generally about fifteen or sixteen feet square built of hewn logs covered with shingles and provided with floors of pine boards These houses were all dry and comfortable and were provided with chimnies so that the people when in them were well sheltered from the inclemencies of the weather In this practice of keeping their slaves well sheltered at night the southern planters are pretty uniform for they know that upon this circumstance more than any other in that climate depends the health of the slave and consequently his value In these thirty-eight cabins were lodged two hundred and fifty people of all ages sexes and sizes Ten or twelve were generally employed in the garden and about the house At a distance of about one hundred yards from the lines of cabins stood the house of the overseer a small two-story log building with a yard and garden attached to it of proportionate dimensions This small house was the abode of a despot more absolute and more cruel than were any of those we read of in the Bible who so grievously oppressed the children of Israel In one corner of the overseer's garden stood the corn crib also a log building in which was stored up the corn constituting the yearly provisions of the coloured people In another corner of the same garden was a large vault covered with sods very like some ice-houses that I have seen This was the potato-house and in it were deposited the sweet potatoes also intended to supply the people At a short distance beyond the garden of the overseer stood a large building constituting the principal feature in the landscape of every great cotton plantation This was the house containing the cotton-gin and the sheds to contain the cotton when brought from the field in the seed and also the bales after being pressed and prepared for market As I shall be obliged to make frequent references to the cotton-gin it may perhaps be well to describe it Formerly there was no way of separating the cotton from the seed but by pulling it of with the fingers--a very tedious and troublesome process-- but a person from the north by the name of Whitney at length discovered the gin which is a very simple though very powerful machine It is composed of a wooden cylinder about six or eight feet in length surrounded at very short intervals with small circular saws in such a manner that as the cylinder is turned rapidly round by a leather strap on the end similar to a turner's lathe the teeth of the saws in turning over continually cut downwards in front of the cylinder which is placed close to a long hopper extending the whole length of the cylinder and so close to it that the seeds of the cotton cannot pass between them This cylinder revolves with almost inconceivable rapidity and great caution is necessary in working with the gin not to touch the saws One end of the cylinder and hopper being slightly elevated the seeds as they are stripped of the wool are gradually but certainly moved toward the lower end where they drop down into a heap after being as perfectly divested of the cotton as they could be by the most careful picking with the fingers The rapid evolutions of the cylinder are procured by the aid of cogs and wheels similar to those used in small grist mills It is necessary to be very careful in working about a cotton-gin more especially in removing the seeds from before the saws for if they do but touch the hand the injury is very great I knew a black man who had all the sinews of the inner part of his right hand torn out--some of them measuring more than a foot in length--and the flesh of his palm cut into tatters by carelessly putting his hand too near the saws when they were in motion for the idle purpose of feeling the strength of the current of air created by the motions of the cylinder A good gin will clean several thousand pounds of cotton in the seed in a day To work the gin two horses are necessary though one is often compelled to perform the labour There was no smoke-house nor any other place for curing or preserving meat attached to the quarter and whilst I was on this plantation no pork was ever salted for the use of the slaves After remaining in the kitchen some time I went into the garden and remained with the gardener assisting him to work until after sundown when my old master came to the gate and called one of the garden boys to him The boy soon returned and told me I must go with him to the quarter as his master had told him to take me to the overseer When we arrived at the overseer's house he had not yet returned from the field but in a few minutes we saw him coming at some distance through a cotton field followed by a great number of black people As he approached us the boy that was with me handed him a small piece of paper which he carried in his hand and without saying a word ran back toward the house leaving me to become acquainted with the overseer in the best way I could But I found this to be no difficult task for he had no sooner glanced his eye over the piece of paper than turning to me he asked me my name and calling to a middle-aged man who was passing us at some distance told him he must take me to live with him and that my supper should be sent to me from his own house I followed my new friend to his cabin which I found to be the habitation of himself his wife and five children The only furniture in this cabin consisted of a few blocks of wood for seats a short bench made of a pine board which served as a table and a small bed in one corner composed of a mat made of common rushes spread upon some corn husks pulled and split into fine pieces and kept together by a narrow slip of wood confined to the floor by wooden pins There was a common iron pot standing beside the chimney and several wooden spoons and dishes hung against the wall Several blankets also hung against the wall upon wooden pins An old box made of pine boards without either lock or binges occupied one corner At the time I entered this humble abode the mistress was not at home She had not yet returned from the field having been sent as the husband informed me with some other people late in the evening to do some work in a field about two miles distant I found a child about a year old lying on the mat-bed and a little girl about four years old beside it These children were entirely naked and when we came to the door the elder rose front its place and ran to its father and clasping him round one of his knees Now we shall get good supper The father laid his hand upon the head of his naked child and stood silently looking in its face--which was turned upwards toward his own for a moment-- and then turning to me Did you leave any children at home The scene before me--the question propounded--and the manner of this poor man and his child caused my heart to swell until my breast seemed too small to contain it My soul fled back upon the wings of fancy to my wife's lowly dwelling in Maryland where I had been so often met on a Saturday evening when I paid them my weekly visit by my own little ones who clung to my knees for protection and support even as the poor little wretch now before me seized upon the weary limb of its hapless and destitute father hoping that naked as he was for he too was naked save only the tattered remains of a pair of old trousers he would bring with his return at evening its customary scanty supper I was unable to reply but stood motionless leaning against the walls of the cabin My children seemed to flit by the door in the dusky twilight and the twittering of a swallow which that moment fluttered over my head sounded in my ear as the infantile tittering of my own little boy but on a moment's reflection I knew that we were separated without the hope of ever again meeting that they no more heard the welcome tread of my feet and could never again receive the little gifts with which poor as I was I was accustomed to present them I was far from the place of my nativity in a land of strangers with no one to care for me beyond the care that a master bestows upon his ox with all my future life one long waste barren desert of cheerless hopeless lifeless slavery to be varied only by the pangs of hunger and the stings of the lash My revery was at length broken by the appearance of the mother of the family with her three eldest children The mother wore an old ragged shift but the children the eldest of whom appeared to be about twelve and the youngest six years old were quite naked When she came in the husband told her that the overseer had sent me to live with them and she and her oldest child who was a boy immediately set about preparing their supper by boiling some of the leaves of the weed called lamb's-quarter in the pot This together with some cakes of cold corn bread formed their supper My supper was brought to me from the house of the overseer by a small girl his daughter It was about half a pound of bread cut from a loaf made of corn meal My companions gave me a part of their boiled greens and we all sat down together to my first meal in my new habitation I had no other bed than the blanket which I had brought with me from Maryland and I went to sleep in the loft of the cabin which was assigned to me as my sleeping room and in which I continued to lodge as long as I remained on this plantation The next morning I was waked at the break of day by the sound of a horn which was blown very loudly Perceiving that it was growing light I came down and went out immediately in front of the house of the overseer who was standing near his own gate blowing the horn In a few minutes the whole of the working people from all the cabins were assembled and as it was now light enough for me distinctly to see such objects as were about me I at once perceived the nature of the servitude to which I was in future to be subject As I have before stated there were altogether on this plantation two hundred and sixty slaves but the number was seldom stationary for a single week Births were numerous and frequent and deaths were not uncommon When I joined them I believe we counted in all two hundred and sixty-three but of these only one hundred and seventy went to the field to work The others were children too small to be of any service as labourers old and blind persons or incurably diseased Ten or twelve were kept about the mansion-house and garden chosen from the most handsome and sprightly of the gang I think about one hundred and sixty-eight assembled this morning at the sound of the horn--two or three being sick sent word to the overseer that they could not come The overseer wrote something on a piece of paper and gave it to his little son This I was told was a note to be sent to our master to inform him that some of the hands were sick--it not being any part of the duty of the overseer to attend to a sick negro The overseer then led off to the field with his horn in one hand and his whip in the other we following--men women and children promiscuously-- and a wretched looking troop we were There was not an entire garment amongst us More than half of the gang were entirely naked Several young girls who had arrived at puberty wearing only the livery with which nature had ornamented them and a great number of lads of an equal or superior age appeared in the same costume There was neither bonnet cap nor head dress of any king amongst us except the old straw hat that I wore and which my wife had made for me in Maryland This I soon laid aside to avoid the appearance of singularity and as owing to the severe treatment I had endured whilst travelling in chains and being compelled to sleep on the naked floor without undressing myself my clothes were quite worn out I did not make a much better figure than my companions though still I preserved the semblance of clothing so far that it could be seen that my shirt and trousers had once been distinct and separate garments Not one of the others had on even the remains of two pieces of apparel Some of the men had old shirts and some ragged trousers but no one wore both Amongst the women several wore petticoats and many had shifts Not one of the whole number wore both of these vestments We walked nearly a mile through one vast cotton field before we arrived at the place of our intended day's labour At last the overseer stopped at the side of the field and calling to several of the men by name ordered them to call their companies and turn into their rows The work we had to do today was to hoe and weed cotton for the last time and the men whose names had been called and who were I believe eleven in number were designated as captains each of whom had under his command a certain number of the other bands The captain was the foreman of his company and those under his command had to keep up with him Each of the men and women had to take one row and two and in some cases where they were very small three of the children had one The first captain whose name was Simon took the first row-- and the other captains were compelled to keep up with him By this means the overseer had nothing to do but to keep Simon hard at work and he was certain that all the others must work equally hard Simon was a stout strong man apparently about thirty-five years of age and for some reason unknown to me I was ordered to take the row next to his The overseer with his whip in his hand walked about the field after us to see that our work was well done As we worked with hoes I had no difficulty in learning how the work was to be performed The fields of cotton at this season of the year are very beautiful The plants amongst which we worked this day were about three feet high and in full bloom with branches so numerous that they nearly covered the whole ground--leaving scarcely space enough between them to permit us to move about and work with our hoes About seven o'clock in the morning the overseer sounded his horn and we all repaired to the shade of some perscimmon trees which grew in a corner of the field to get our breakfast I here saw a cart drawn by a yoke of oxen driven by an old black man nearly blind The cart contained three barrels filled with water and several large baskets full of corn bread that had been baked in the ashes The water was for us to drink and the bread was our breakfast The little son of the overseer was also in the cart and had brought with him the breakfast of his father in a small wooden bucket The overseer had bread butter cold ham and coffee for his breakfast Ours was composed of a corn cake weighing about three quarters of a pound to each person with as much water as was desired I at first supposed that this bread was dealt out to the people as their allowance but on further inquiry I found this not to be the case Simon by whose side I was now at work and who seemed much pleased with my agility and diligence in my duty told me that here as well as every where in this country each person received a peck of corn at the crib door every Sunday evening and that in ordinary times every one had to grind this corn and bake it for him or herself making such use of it as the owner thought proper but that for some time past the overseer for the purpose of saving the time which had been lost in baking the bread had made it the duty of an old woman who was not capable of doing much work in the field to stay at the quarter and bake the bread of the whole gang When baked it was brought to the field in a cart as I saw and dealt out in loaves They still had to grind their own corn after night and as there were only three hand-mills on the plantation he they experienced much difficulty in converting their corn into meal We worked in this field all day and at the end of every hour or hour and a quarter we had permission to go to the cart which was moved about the field so as to be near us and get water Our dinner was the same in all respects as our breakfast except that in addition to the bread we had a little salt and a radish for each person We were not allowed to rest at either breakfast or dinner longer than while we were eating and we worked in the evening as long as we could distinguish the weeds from the cotton plants Simon informed me that formerly when they baked their own bread they had left their work soon after sundown to go home and bake for the next day but the overseer had adopted the new policy for the purpose of keeping them at work until dark When we could no longer see to work the horn was again sounded and we returned home I had now lived through one of the days--a succession of which make up the life of a slave--on a cotton plantation As we went out in the morning I observed several women who carried their young children in their arms to the field These mothers laid their children at the side of the fence or under the shade of the cotton plants whilst they were at work and when the rest of us went to get water they would go to give suck to their children requesting some one to bring them water in gourds which they were careful to carry to the field with them One young woman did not like the others leave her child at the end of the row but had contrived a sort of rude knapsack made of a piece of coarse linen cloth in which she fastened her child which was very young upon her back and in this way carried it all day and performed her task at the hoe with the other people I pitied this woman and as we were going home at night I came near her and spoke to her Perceiving as soon as she spoke that she had not been brought up amongst the slaves of this plantation-- for her language was different from theirs--I asked her why she did not do as the other women did and leave her child at the end of the row in the shade Indeed she I cannot leave my child in the weeds amongst the snakes What would be my feelings if I should leave it there and a scorpion were to bite it Besides my child cries so piteously when I leave it alone in the field that I cannot bear to hear it Poor thing I wish we were both in the grave where all sorrow is forgotten I asked this woman who did not appear to be more than twenty years old how long she had been here and where she came from I have been here she almost two years and came from the Eastern Shore I once lived as well as any lady in Maryland I was born a slave in the family of a gentleman whose name was Le Compt My master was a man of property lived on his estate and entertained much company My mistress who was very kind to me made me her nurse when I was about ten years old and put me to live with her own children I grew up amongst her daughters not as their equal and companion but as a favoured and indulged servant I was always well dressed and received a portion of all the delicacies of their table I wanted nothing and had not the trouble of providing even for myself I believe there was not a happier being in the world than I was At present none can be more wretched When I was yet a child my master had given me to his oldest daughter who was about one year older than I was To her I had always looked as my future mistress and expected that whenever she became a wife I should follow her person and cease to be a member of the family of her father When I was almost seventeen my young mistress married a gentleman of the Eastern Shore of Virginia who had been addressing her more than a year Soon after the wedding was over my new master removed his wife to his own residence and took me and a black boy of my own age that the lady's father had given her with him He had caused it to be reported in Maryland that he was very wealthy and was the owner of a plantation with a large stock of slaves and other property It was supposed at the time of the marriage that my young mistress was making a very good match and all her friends were pleased with it When her lover came to visit her he always rode in a handsome gig accompanied by a black man on horseback as his servant This man told us in the kitchen that his master was one of the most fashionable men in Virginia was a man of large fortune and that all the young ladies in the county he lived in had their eyes upon him These stories I repeated carefully to my young mistress and added every persuasion that I could think of to induce her to accept her lover as her husband My feelings had become deeply interested in the issue of this matter for whilst the master was striving to win the heart of my young mistress the servant had already conquered mine It was more than a hundred miles from the residence of my old master to that of my young one and when we arrived at the latter place my mistress and I soon found that we had been equally credulous and were equally deceived We were taken to an old dilapidated mansion which was quite in keeping with every thing on the estate to which it was attached The house was almost without furniture and there were no servants in it except myself and my companion The black man who had so effectually practiced upon me belonged to one of my new master's companions--and had a wife and three children in the neighbourhood My mistress soon discovered that her husband's companions were gamblers and horse racers who frequently convened at her house to concert or mature some scheme the object of which was to cheat some one My old master was a member of the church and was very scrupulous in the observance of his moral duties His precepts had been deeply implanted in the mind of my young mistress and the society of these sportsmen as the friends of my young master denominated themselves became so revolting to her feelings that after she had been married nearly a year and had exhausted all her patience and all her fortitude in endeavouring to reclaim her husband from the vile associations and pursuits by which his time and his affections were engaged she determined at last to return to her father for a time and to take me with her for the purpose of ascertaining whether this would not bring him to reflect upon the wrong he had done her as well as himself She communicated to me her designs and we were waiting for an opportunity of carrying them into effect when one evening near sundown my master came to me in the kitchen and told me he wished me to go to the house of a gentleman who lived about a mile distant and deliver a letter for him without letting my mistress know any thing of the matter I immediately set out expecting to return in half an hour As I left the house I saw my mistress in the garden and I never saw her again Between the house of my master and that to which he had sent me was a grove of young pine trees that had grown up in a field that had formerly been cultivated but which had been neglected on account of its poverty for many years Through this thicket the path which I had to travel led and when near the middle of the wood I saw a white man step into the path only a few yards before me with a rope in his hand Sometime before this my mistress had told me that she wished to get me back to her father's house in Maryland because she was afraid that my master would sell me to the negro buyers and the moment I saw the man with the rope in my path the words of my mistress were recollected I screamed and turned to fly towards home but at the first step was met by the coloured man who had attended my master as his servant when he visited Maryland at the time he was courting my mistress--and who had made so deep an impression on my heart This was the first time I had seen him since I came to live in Virginia and base as I knew he must be from his former conduct to me yet at sight of him my former affection for a moment revived and I rushed into his arms which were extended towards me hoping that he would save me from the danger I so much dreaded from behind He saw that I was frightened and had fled to him for protection and only 'Come with me' I followed him more by instinct than by reason and holding to his arm ran as fast as I could-- I knew not whither I did not observe whether we were on the path or not I do not know how far we had run when he stopped and --'We must remain here for some time' In a few minutes the white man whom I had seen in the path came up with us and seizing me by the hands he and my pretended protector bound them together at my back and to suppress my cries tied a large handkerchief round my head and over my mouth It was now becoming dark and they hurried out of the wood and across the fields to a small creek the water of which fell into the Chesapeake Bay Here was a boat and another white man in it They forced me on board and the white men taking the oars whilst the black managed the rudder we were quickly out in the bay and in less than an hour I was on board a small schooner lying at anchor where I found eleven others who like myself had been dragged from their homes and their friends to be sold to the southern traders I have no doubt that my master had sold me without the knowledge of my mistress and that he endeavoured to persuade her that I had run away perhaps he was successful in this endeavour I heard no more of my mistress for whom I was very sorry for I knew she would be greatly distressed at losing me The vessel remained at anchor where we found her that night and the next day until evening when she made sail and beat up the bay all night against a head wind When she approached the western shore she hoisted a red handkerchief at her mast head and a boat came off from the land large enough to carry us all and we were removed to a house on the bank of York river where I found about thirty men and women all imprisoned in the cellar of a small tavern The men were in irons but the women were not bound with any thing The cords and handkerchief had been taken from me whilst on board the vessel We remained at York river more than a week and whilst there twenty-five or thirty persons were brought in and shut up with us When we commenced our journey for the south we were about sixty in number The men were chained together but the women were all left quite at liberty At the end of three weeks we reached Savannah river opposite the town of Augusta where we were sold out by our owner Our present master was there and purchased me and another woman who has been at work in the field to-day Soon after I was brought home the overseer compelled me to be married to a man I did not like He is a native of Africa and still retains the manners and religion of his country He has not been with us to day as he is sick and under the care of the doctor I must hasten home to get my supper and go to rest and glad I should be if I were never to rise again I have several times been whipped unmercifully because I was not strong enough to do as much work with the hoe as the other women who have lived all their lives on this plantation and have been accustomed from their infancy to work in the field For a long time after I was brought here I thought it would be impossible for me to live on the coarse and scanty food with which we are supplied When I contrast my former happiness with my present misery I pray for death to deliver me from my sufferings I was deeply affected by the narrative of this woman and as we had loitered on our way it was already dark whilst we were at some distance from the quarter but the sound of the overseer's horn here interrupted our conversation--at hearing which she exclaimed We are too late let us run or we shall be whipped and setting off as fast as she could carry her child she left me alone A moment's reflection however convinced me that I too had better quicken my pace--I quickly passed the woman encumbered with her infant and arrived in the crowd of the people some time perhaps a minute before her X AT the time I joined the company the overseer was calling over the names of the whole from a little book and the first name that I heard was that of my companion whom I had just left which was Lydia--called by him Lyd As she did not answer I Master Lydia the woman that carries the baby on her back will be here in a minute-- I left her just behind The overseer took no notice of what I but went on with his roll-call As the people answered to their names they passed off to the cabins except three--two women and a man who when their names were called were ordered to go into the yard in front of the overseer's house My name was the last on the list and when it was called I was ordered into the yard with the three others Just as we had entered Lydia came up out of breath with the child in her arms and following us into the yard dropped on her knees before the overseer and begged him to forgive her Where have you been he Poor Lydia now burst into tears and I only stopped to talk awhile to this man pointing to me but indeed master overseer I will never do so again Lie down was his reply Lydia immediately fell prostrate upon the ground and in this position he compelled her to remove her old tow linen shift the only garment she wore so as to expose her hips when he gave her ten lashes with his long whip every touch of which brought blood and a shriek from the sufferer He then ordered her to go and get her supper with an injunction never to stay behind again The other three culprits were then put upon their trial The first was a middle aged woman who had as her overseer left several hills of cotton in the course of the day without cleaning and hilling them in a proper manner She received twelve lashes The other two were charged in general terms with having been lazy and of having neglected their work that day Each of these received twelve lashes These people all received punishment in the same manner that it had been inflicted upon Lydia and when they were all gone the overseer turned to me and --Boy you are a stranger here yet but I called you in to let you see how things are done here and to give you a little advice When I get a new negro under my command I never whip at first I always give him a few days to learn his duty unless he is an outrageous villain in which case I anoint him a little at the beginning I call over the names of all the hands twice every week on Wednesday and Saturday evenings and settle with them according to their general conduct for the last three days I call the names of my captains every morning and it is their business to see that they have all their hands in their proper places You ought not to have staid behind to-night with Lyd but as this is your first offence I shall overlook it and you may go and get your supper I made a low bow and thanked master overseer for his kindness to me and left him This night for supper we had corn bread and cucumbers but we had neither salt vinegar nor pepper with the cucumbers I had never before seen people flogged in the way our overseer flogged his people This plan of making the person who is to be whipped lie down upon the ground was new to me though it is much practised in the south and I have since seen men and women too cut nearly in pieces by this mode of punishment It has one advantage over tying people up by the hands as it prevents all accidents from sprains in the thumbs or wrists I have known people to hurt their joints very much by struggling when tied up by the thumbs or wrists to undergo a severe whipping The method of ground whipping as it is called is in my opinion very indecent as it compels females to expose themselves in a very shameful manner The whip used by the overseers on the cotton plantations is different from all other whips that I have ever seen The staff is about twenty or twenty-two inches in length with a large and heavy head which is often loaded with a quarter or half a pound of lead wrapped in cat-gut and securely fastened on so that nothing but the greatest violence can separate it from the staff The lash is ten feet long made of small strips of buckskin tanned so as to be dry and hard and plaited carefully and closely together of the thickness in the largest part of a man's little finger but quite small at each extremity At the farthest end of this thong is attached a cracker nine inches in length made of strong sewing silk twisted and knotted until it feels as firm as the hardest twine This whip in an unpractised hand is a very awkward and inefficient weapon but the best qualification of the overseer of a cotton plantation is the ability of using this whip with adroitness and when wielded by an experienced arm it is one of the keenest instruments of torture ever invented by the ingenuity of man The cat-o'-nine tails used in the British military service is but a clumsy instrument beside this whip which has superseded the cow-hide the hickory and every other species of lash on the cotton plantations The cow-hide and hickory bruise and mangle the flesh of the sufferer but this whip cuts when expertly applied almost as keen as a knife and never bruises the flesh nor injures the bones It was now Saturday night and I wished very much for Sunday morning to come that I might see the manner of spending the Sabbath on a great cotton plantation I expected that as these people had been compelled to work so hard and fare so poorly all the week they would be inclined to repose themselves on Sunday and that the morning of this day would be passed in quietness if not in sleep by the inhabitants of our quarter No horn was blown by the overseer to awaken us this morning and I slept in my little loft until it was quite day but when I came down I found our small community a scene of universal bustle and agitation Here it is necessary to make my readers acquainted with the rules of polity which governed us on Sunday for I now speak of myself as one of the slaves on this plantation and with the causes which gave rise to these rules All over the south the slaves are discouraged as much as possible and by all possible means from going to any place of religious worship on Sunday This is to prevent them from associating together from different estates and distant parts of the country and plotting conspiracies and insurrections On some estates the overseers are required to prohibit the people from going to meeting off the plantation at any time under the severest penalties While preachers cannot come upon the plantations to preach to the people without first obtaining permission of the master and afterwards procuring the sanction of the overseer No slave dare leave the plantation to which he belongs a single mile without a written pass from the overseer or master but by exposing himself to the danger of being taken up and flogged Any white man who meets a slave off the plantation without a pass has a right to take him up and flog him at his discretion All these causes combined operate powerfully to keep the slave at home But in addition to those principles of restraint it is a rule on every plantation that no overseer ever departs from to flog every slave male or female that leaves the estate for a single hour by night or by day--Sunday not excepted-- without a written pass The overseer who should permit the people under his charge to go about the neighbourhood without a pass would soon lose his character and no one would employ him nor would his reputation less certainly suffer in the estimation of the planters were he to fall into the practice of granting passes except on the most urgent occasions and for purposes generally to be specified in the pass A cotton planter has no more idea of permitting his slaves to go at will about the neighbourhood on Sunday than a farmer in Pennsylvania has of letting his horses out of his field on that day Nor would the neighbours be less inclined to complain of the annoyance in the former than in the latter case There has always been a strong repugnance amongst the planters against their slaves becoming members of any religious society Not as I believe because they are so maliciously disposed towards their people as to wish to deprive them of the comforts of religion--provided the principles of religion did not militate against the principles of slavery-- but they fear that the slaves by attending meetings and listening to the preachers may imbibe with the morality they teach the notions of equality and liberty contained in the gospel This I have no doubt is the ground of all the dissatisfaction that the planters express with the itinerant preachers who have from time to time sought opportunities of instructing the slaves in their religious duties The cotton planters have always since I knew any thing of them been most careful to prevent the slaves from learning to read and such is the gross ignorance that prevails that many of them could not name the four cardinal points At the time I first went to Carolina there were a great many African slaves in the country and they continued to come in for several years afterwards I became intimately acquainted with some of these men Many of them believed there were several gods some of whom were good and others evil and they prayed as much to the latter as to the former I knew several who must have been from what I have since learned Mohamedans though at that time I had never heard of the religion of Mohamed There was one man on this plantation who prayed five times every day always turning his face to the east when in the performance of his devotion There is in general very little sense of religious obligation or duty amongst the slaves on the cotton plantations and Christianity cannot be with propriety called the religion of these people They are universally subject to the grossest and most abject superstition and uniformly believe in witchcraft conjuration and the agency of evil spirits in the affairs of human life Far the greater part of them are either natives of Africa or the descendants of those who have always from generation to generation lived in the south since their ancestors were landed on this continent and their superstition for it does not deserve the name of religion is no better nor is it less ferocious than that which oppresses the inhabitants of the wildest regions of Negro-land They have not the slightest religious regard for the Sabbath-day and their masters make no efforts to impress them with the least respect for this sacred institution My first Sunday on this plantation was but a prelude to all that followed and I shall here give an account of it At the time I rose this morning it wanted only about fifteen or twenty minutes of sunrise and a large number of the men as well as some of the women had already quitted the quarter and gone about the business of the day That is they had gone to work for wages for themselves--in this manner our overseer had about two miles off a field of near twenty acres planted in cotton on his own account He was the owner of this land but as he had no slaves he was obliged to hire people to work it for him or let it lie waste He had procured this field to be cleared as I was told partly by letting white men make tar and turpentine from the pine wood grew on it and partly by hiring slaves to work upon it on Sunday About twenty of our people went to work for him to-day for which he gave them fifty cents each Several of the others perhaps forty in all went out through the neighbourhood to work for other planters On every plantation with which I ever had any acquaintance the people are allowed to make patches as they are called--that is gardens in some remote and unprofitable part of the estate generally in the woods in which they plant corn potatoes pumpkins melons c for themselves These patches they must cultivate on Sunday or let them go uncultivated I think that on this estate there were about thirty of these patches cleared in the woods and fenced--some with rails and others with brush--the property of the various families The vegetables that grow in these patches were always consumed in the families of the owners and the money that was earned by hiring out was spent in various ways sometimes for clothes sometimes for better food than was allowed by the overseer and sometimes for rum but those who drank rum had to do it by stealth By the time the sun was up an hour this morning our quarter was nearly as quiet and clear of inhabitants as it had been at the same period on the previous day As I had nothing to do for myself I went with Lydia whose husband was still sick to help her to work in her patch which was about a mile and a half from our dwelling We took with us some bread and a large bucket of water and worked all day She had onions cabbages cucumbers melons and many other things in her garden In the evening as we returned home we were joined by the man who prayed five times a day and at the going down of the sun he stopped and prayed aloud in our hearing in a language I did not understand This man told me he formerly lived on the confines of a country which had no trees nor grass upon it and that in some places no water was to be found for several days' journey That this barren country was nevertheless inhabited by a race of men who had many camels and goats and some horses They had no settled place of residence but removed from one part of the country to another in quest of places Where green herbage was to be found--their chief food being the milk of their camels and goats but that they also ate the flesh of these animals sometimes The hair of those people was not short and woolly like that of the negroes nor were they of a shining black They were continually at war with some of the neighbouring people and very often with his own countrymen He was himself once taken prisoner by them when a lad in a great battle fought between them and his own people in which his party were defeated The victors kept him in their possession more than two years compelling him to attend to their camels and goats Whilst he was with these people they travelled a great way towards the rising sun and came to a river running through a country inhabited by yellow people where the land was very rich and produced great quantities of rice such as grows here-- and many other kinds of grain The people who had taken him prisoner professed the same religion that he did and it was forbidden by its precepts for one an to sell another into slavery who held the same faith with himself otherwise he should have been sold to these yellow people In the river of this country be saw alligators in great abundance like those that he had seen in Carolina and the musquitos were in some places so numerous that it was difficult to breathe without inhaling them When we turned the camels out to graze we used tie their fore-feet together with a rope made of the hair of this animal spun upon small sticks and twisted into a rope Sometimes they broke these ropes and slipped their feet out of its coils and it was then very difficult to retake them They would sometimes strike off at a trot across the open country and we would be obliged to mount other camels and follow them for a day or two before we could retake them I had been with these people so long and being of the same religion with themselves had become so familiar with their customs and manner of life that they seemed almost to regard me as one of their own nation and frequently sent me alone in pursuit of the stray camels giving me instructions how to direct my course so as to rejoin them for they never waited for me to return to them at the place where I left them if the beasts had consumed the bushes and green herbage growing there before I came back When I had been a captive with them fully two years we came one evening and encamped at a little well the mouth of which was about a yard over and the water in which was very sweet and good This well seemed to have been scooped out of the hard and flinty sand with men's hands and was scarcely more than four feet deep though it contained an abundant supply of water We encamped by this fountain all night and I remembered that we had been at the same place soon after I was made a prisoner and that when we had formerly come to it we travelled with our backs to the mid-day sun There was no herbage hereabout except a few stunted and thorny bushes and in wandering abroad in quest of something to eat one of the best and fleetest camels entangled the rope which bound his fore-feet amongst these bushes and broke it I found part of the rope fast to a bush in the morning but the camel was at a great distance from us towards the setting sun The chief of our party ordered me to mount another camel and go with a long rope in pursuit of the stray and told me that they should travel towards the south that day and encamp at a place where there was much grass I went in pursuit of the lost camel but when I came near him he took off at a great trot over the country--and I pursued him until noon without ever being able to overtake him or even to change the line of his march His course was towards the south-west and when I found it impossible to overtake him as his speed was superior to that of the beast I rode I resolved to strive to accomplish that by stratagem which force could not effect I knew the beasts were both hungry and that having received as much water as they could drink the night before they would devour with the utmost avidity the first green herbage that they might meet with I slackened the speed of my camel and followed at a leisure gait after the one I pursued suffering him to leave me behind him at a considerable distance He still however kept on in the same direction and with nearly the same speed with which he had advanced all the morning so that it became necessary for me to quicken my pace to prevent him from passing out of my sight and escaping from me altogether About five o'clock in the afternoon I came in sight of trees the tops of which were only visible across the open plain The camel I rode was now as desirous to advance rapidly as his leader had been throughout the day I was carried forward as quickly as the swiftest horse could trot and awhile before sundown I approached a small grove of tall straight trees which are greatly valued in Africa and which bear large quantities of nuts of a very good quality Under and about these trees was a small tract of ground covered with long green grass and here my stray camel stopped I have no doubt that he had scented the odour of this grass soon after I first gave chase to him in the morning though the distance at which he was from it was so great that the best horse could not have travelled it in one day When I came up to the trees I dismounted from the camel I rode and tying its feet together with a short rope preserved my long one for the purpose of taking the runaway I gathered as many nuts as I could eat and after satisfying my hunger lay down to sleep This was the first time that I had ever attempted to pass a night alone in this open country and after I had made my bed in the grass I became fearful that some wild beast might fall in with me before morning as I had often heard lions and other creatures of prey breaking the stillness of night in those desolate regions by their yells and roaring I therefore ascended a tree and placed myself amongst some spreading limbs in such a position as to be in no danger of falling even if I should be overtaken by sleep The moon was now full and in that country where there are no clouds and where there is seldom any dew objects can be distinguished at the distance of several miles over the plains by moonlight When I had been in the tree about an hour I heard at a great distance a loud sullen noise between a growl and a roar which I knew to proceed from a lion for I was well acquainted with the habits and noise of this animal having frequently assisted in hunting him in my own country I was greatly terrified by this circumstance not for my own safety for I knew that no beast of prey could reach me in the tree but I feared that my camels might be devoured and I be left to perish in the desert My fears were in part well founded for keeping my eye steadily directed towards the point from which the sound had proceeded it was not long before I saw some object moving over the naked plain The runaway camel now joined his tethered companion and both quitting the herbage came and stood at the root of the tree upon the branches of which I was I still kept my eye steadily fixed upon the moving body which was evidently advancing nearer to me over the plain I had no longer any doubt that it was coming to the grove of trees which were only twelve or fifteen in number and so bare of branches that I could distinctly see in every direction around me In a few minutes the animal approached me It was a monstrous lion of the black maned species It was now within one hundred paces of me and the poor camels raised their heads as high as they could towards me and crouched close to the trunk of the tree apparently so stupified by fear as to be incapable of attempting to fly The lion approached with a kind of motion and at length dropping on its belly glided along the ground until within about ten yards of the tree when uttering a terrific roar which shook the stillness of the night for many a league around he sprang upon and seized the unbound camel by the neck Finding that I afforded no protection the animal after striving in vain to shake off his assailant rushed out upon the open plain carrying on his back the lion which I could perceive had already fastened upon the throat of his victim which did not go more than a stone's cast from the trees before he fell and after a short struggle ceased to move his limbs The lion held the poor beast by the throat for some time after he was dead and until I suppose the blood had ceased to flow from his veins--then quitting the neck he turned to the side of the slain and tearing a hole into the cavity of the body extracted the intestines and devoured the liver and heart before he began to gorge himself with the flesh The moon was now high in the heavens and shone with such exceeding brilliancy that I could see distinctly for many miles round me In that country the smooth and glittering surface of the hard and baked sandy plains reflects the light of the moon as strongly as a sheet of snow in winter does in this and the atmosphere being free from all humidity is so clear and transparent that I could perceive the quivering motion of the camel's lips in his last agony as well as the tongue of the lion when he licked the blood from his paws As soon my fright had a little subsided I looked for my surviving camel which to my terror I could not see either at the foot of the tree on which I was and where I had last seen it or any where in the grove I now concluded that in the alarm caused by the lion and the destruction of his companion my surviving beast had broken the cord which bound its feet and had taken to flight leaving me alone and without any means of escaping from the desert for I had no hope of being able to reach on foot either the people with whom I had so long lived or the inhabitants of the woody countries lying far to the south of me No condition can be more miserable than that to which I was now reduced My late masters were distant from me at least one day's journey on a swift camel and were removing farther from me every day as fast as their beasts could carry them and I had no knowledge of the various watering places and spots of herbage which lie scattered over the wide expanse of those unfrequented regions in the midst of which I then was I had not seen any water at this place since I came to it and had not the poor consolation of knowing that I could remain here and live on the fruit of the trees until some chance should bring hither some of the wandering tribes that roam over those solitudes After a lapse of two or three hours not being able to discover my living camel anywhere although the moon had now passed her meridian and shone with a splendour which enabled me to distinguish small pebbles at some distance I gave him up for lost and again turned my attention to the lion which still continued at intervals to utter deep and sullen growls over his prey I expected that at the approach of day the lion would leave the dead carcass and retire to his lair in some distant place and I determined to await the period of his departure to descend the tree and search for water amongst the grass which rose in some places to the height of my shoulders I slept none this night--but from my couch in the boughs watched the motions of the lion which after swallowing at least one third of the camel stretched himself at full length on his belly about twenty paces from it and laying his head between his fore-feet prepared to guard his spoil against all the intruders of the night In this position he remained until the sun was up in the morning and began to dart his rays across the naked and parched plain upon which he lay--when rising and stretching himself he walked slowly towards the grove-- passed under me--went to the other side of the trees and entered some very tall herbage where I heard him lap water I now knew that I was in no danger of dying from thirst provided I could escape wild beasts on my way to and from the fountain The trees afforded me both food and shelter but I quickly found myself deprived of lasting water at the present--for the lion after slaking his thirst returned by the same way that he had gone to the water and coming to the tree in the boughs of which I lay rubbed himself against its trunk raising his tail and exposing his sides alternately to the friction of the rough bark After continuing this exercise for some time he rested his weight on his hind-feet licked his breast fore-legs and paws and then lying down on his side in the shade appeared to fall into a deep sleep Great as my anxiety was to leave my present lodgings I dared not attempt to pass the sentinel that kept guard at the root of the tree even though he slept on his post for whenever I made the least rustling it the branches I perceived that he moved his ears and opened his eyes but closed the latter again when the noise ceased The lion lay all day under the tree only removing so as to place himself in the shade in the afternoon but soon after the sun descended below the horizon in the evening he aroused himself and resting upon his hind-feet as he had done in the morning uttered a roar that shook all the leaves about my head and caused a tremulous motion in the branches upon which I rested This horrid noise together with the sight of the great beast that uttered it so agitated my whole frame that I was near leaping from my seat and falling to the ground I was so overcome with fear that all prudence and self-possession forsook me and I uttered a loud shout as if in defiance of the monster below me The moment the lion heard my voice he raised his head looked directly at me with his fiery eyes and crouched down in the attitude of springing but perceiving me to be quite out of the reach of his longest leap he walked slowly off and lay down about half way between me and the dead camel with his head towards my tree I had no doubt that his object was to watch me until my descent from the tree that he might make his supper of me this night as he had of my camel the night before I had now been without water two days--my thirst was tormenting and I had no prospect before me but of remaining in this tree until driven to delirium for water I should voluntarily descend and deliver myself into the jaws of my enemy The moon did not rise this night until long after the disappearance of daylight but in the country where I then was the stars shed such abundant light that objects of magnitude can be seen at a great distance by their rays without the aid of the moon The lion moved frequently from place to place but I could perceive that his attention was still fixed upon me at last however be started away across the plain and went farther and farther from me until at length I lost sight of him in the distance and all remained as quiet and noiseless in the immense expanse around me as the land of the dead I now thought of descending to go in quest of water but whilst I deliberated upon this subject the moon rose and cast her broad and glorious light upon these wide fields of desolation As I could now see every thing I resolved to descend but before doing this thought it prudent to cast a look about me to see if there might not be some other beast of prey near This thought saved my life for on turning my eyes in a direction quite different from that in which the lion had departed I saw him returning within two or three stone's cast creeping along the ground I watched him and he came and placed himself between me and the water All was again silent and I remained in the tree burning with thirst until the moon was elevated high in the heavens when the silence was interrupted by the roaring of a lion at a great distance which was again repeated after a short interval At the end of half an hour I again heard the same lion apparently not far off Casting my eye in the direction of the sound I saw the beast advancing rapidly as I thought towards me and began to apprehend that a whole den of lions were lying in wait for me The stranger soon undeceived me for he was coming to partake of the dead camel whose flesh or blood he had doubtlessly smelled though it was not putrid for in this dry atmosphere flesh is preserved a long time free from taint and is sometimes dried in the sun in a state of perfect soundness I knew the nature of the lion too well to suppose that the stranger was going to get his supper free of cost and before he had reached the carcass my jailer quitted his post and set off to defend his acquisition of the last night The new comer arrived first and fell upon the dead camel with the fury of a hungry lion--as he was but he had scarcely swallowed a second morsel when the rightful owner uttering a roar yet more dreadful than any that had preceded it leaped upon the intruder and brought him to the ground For a moment I heard nothing but the gnashing of teeth the clashing of talons and the sounds caused by the laceration of the flesh and hides of the combatants but anon they rolled along the ground and filled the whole canopy of heaven with their yells of rage--then the roaring would cease and only the rending of the flesh of these lords of the waste could be heard--then the roaring would again burst forth with renewed energy This battle lasted more than an hour but at length both appearing to be exhausted they lay for some minutes on their sides each with the other wrapped in his fierce embrace In the end I perceived that one of them rose and walked away leaving the other upon the ground The victor which I could perceive was the stranger for his mane was not black returned to the remnant of the camel and lay down panting beside it After he had taken time to breathe he recommenced his attack and consumed far the larger part of the carcass Having eaten to fulness he took up the bones and remaining flesh of the camel and set out across the desert--I followed him with my eye for more than an hour Parched as my throat was but still afraid to descend from my place of safety I remained on the tree until the light of the next morning when I examined carefully around to see that there was no beast of prey lurking about the place where I knew the water to be Perceiving no danger I descended before the sun was up and going to the water knelt down and drank as long and as much as I thought I could with safety I then proceeded to make a more minute examination of this place and saw numerous tracks of wild goats and of other animals that had come here as well to drink as to eat the grass I also saw the tracks of lions and other beasts of prey which satisfied me that these had come to lie in wait for other animals coming to drink it also convinced me that it was not safe for me to remain in this grove alone but I knew of no means by which I could escape from it It now occurred to my mind that if my living camel had not escaped from me I might have made my way to my own country for on my camel I had two leather bottles which I had neglected to fill with water the morning I left the company of my former masters By replenishing these from the fountain giving my camel as much as he could drink and filling two small sacks attached to my saddle with the nuts from these trees I should have been equipped for a journey of ten days within which period I had no doubt I should have been able to reach my own people but my camel was gone and reflections served only to aggravate the bitterness of my anguish I walked out upon the desert and prayed to be delivered from the perils that environed me At the distance of two or three miles from me I now observed small sand hill rising to the height of eight or ten feet easily perceived when looking along the level surface of the ground but which had escaped my observation from my elevated post in the tree Such sand hills are often found in those deserts and sometimes contain the bones of men and animals that have been buried in them In my situation I could not remain idle and urged forward by restlessness bordering on despair resolved to go to the little hill before me without having any definite object in view I soon approached the hill and having reached its foot walked along its base for some distance I then turned to go back to the trees but after advancing a few steps was seized with a sudden impulse which urged me to go to the top of the sand hill I again turned and walked slowly to the summit beyond which I saw only the same dreary expanse that I was so well used to look upon Advancing along the top of this sand hill which had been blown up by the wind in a long narrow ridge I saw a recess or hollow place on the side opposite to that by which I had ascended it and on coming to this spot beheld my camel crouched down close to the ground with his neck extended at full length My joy was unbounded--I leaped with delight and was wild for some minutes with a delirium of gladness My camel had fled from the grove at the time his companion was killed by the lion and reaching this place had here taken refuge and had not moved since I hastened to loose his feet from the cords with which I had bound them mounted upon his back and was quickly at the watering place I filled my two water skins with water and gathering any nuts as my sacks would contain caused my camel to take a full draught and fill his stomach with grass and then directed my course to the south with a quick pace It was now noon when I left this watering place and I travelled hard all that day and the succeeding night until the moon rose I then alighted and causing my camel to lie down crept close to his side and betook myself to sleep I rested well this night and recommencing my journey at the dawn of day I pursued my route without any thing worthy of relating happening to me until the eighth day when I discovered trees and all the appearance of a woody country before me Soon after entering the forest I came to a small stream of water Descending this stream a few miles I found some people who were cutting grass for the purpose of making mats to sleep on These people spoke my own language and told me that one of them had been in my native village lately They took me and my camel to their village and treated me very kindly promising me that after I had recovered from my fatigue they would go with me to my friends My protectors were at war with a nation whose religion was different from ours and about a month after I came to the village we were alarmed one morning just at break of day by the horrible uproar caused by mingled shouts of men and blows given with heavy sticks upon large wooden drums The village was surrounded by enemies who attacked us with clubs long wooden spears and bows and arrows After fighting for more than an hour those who were not fortunate enough to run away were made prisoners It was not the object of our enemies to kill they wished to take us alive and sell us as slaves I was knocked down by a heavy blow of a club and when I recovered from the stupor that followed I found myself tied fast with the long rope that I had brought from the desert and in which I had formerly led the camels of my masters We were immediately led away from this village through the forest and were compelled to travel all day as fast as we could walk We had nothing to eat on this journey but a small quantity of grain taken with ourselves This grain we were compelled to carry on our backs and roast by the fires which we kindled at nights to frighten away the wild beasts We travelled three weeks in the woods--sometimes without any path at all and arrived one day at a large river with a rapid current Here we were forced to help our conquerors to roll a great number of dead trees into the water from a vast pile that had been thrown together by high floods These trees being dry and light floated high out of the water and when several of the were fastened together with the tough branches of young trees formed a raft upon which we all placed ourselves and descended the river for three days when we came in sight of what appeared to me the most wonderful object in the world this was a large ship at anchor in the river When our raft came near the ship the white people--for such they were on board--assisted to take us on deck and the logs were suffered to float down the river I had never seen white people before and they appeared to me the ugliest creatures in the world The persons who brought us down the river received payment for us of the people in the ship in various articles of which I remember that a keg of liquor and some yards of blue and red cotton cloth were the principal At the time we came into this ship she was full of black people who were all confined in a dark and low place in irons The women were in irons as well as the men About twenty persons were seized in our village at the time I was and amongst these were three children so young that they were not able to walk or to eat any hard substance The mothers of these children had brought them all the way with them and had them in their arms when we were taken on board this ship When they put us in irons to be sent to our place of confinement in the ship the men who the irons on these others took the children out of their hands and threw the over the side of the ship into the water When this was done two of the women leaped overboard after the children-- the third was already confined by a chain to another woman and could not get into the water but in struggling to disengage herself she broke her arm and died a few days after of a fever One of the two women who were in the river was carried down by the weight of her irons before she could be rescued but the other was taken up by some men in a boat and brought on board This woman threw herself overboard one night when we were at sea The weather was very hot whilst we lay in the river and many of us died every day but the number brought on board greatly exceeded those who died and at the end of two weeks the place in which we were confined was so full that no one could lie down and we were obliged to sit all the time for the room was not high enough for us to stand When our prison would hold no more the ship sailed down the river and on the night of the second day after she sailed I heard the roaring of the ocean as it dashed against her sides After we had been at sea some days the irons were removed from the women and they were permitted to go upon deck but whenever the wind blew high they were driven down amongst us We had nothing to eat but yams which were thrown amongst us at random--and of these we had scarcely enough to support life More than one-third of us died on the passage and when we arrived at Charleston I was not able to stand It was more than a week after I left the ship before I could straighten my limbs I was bought by a trader with several others brought up the country and sold to our present master I have been here five years IX It was dusky twilight when this narrative was ended and we hastened home to the quarter When we arrived the overseer had not yet come He had been at his cotton field with the people he had hired in the morning to work for him but he soon made his appearance and going into his house came out with a small bag of money and paid each one the price he had a right to receive In this transaction the overseer acted with entire fairness to the people who worked for him and with the exception of the moral turpitude of violating the Sabbath in this shameful manner the business was conducted with propriety I must here observe that when the slaves go out to work for wages on Sunday their employers never flog them and so far as I know never give them abusive language I have often hired myself to work on Sunday and have been employed in this way by more than twenty different persons not one of whom ever insulted or maltreated me in any way They seldom took the trouble of coming to look at me until towards evening and sometimes not them I worked faithfully because I knew that if I did not I could not expect payment and those who hired me knew that if I did not work well they need not employ me The practice of working on Sunday is so universal amongst the slaves on the cotton plantations that the immorality of the matter is never spoken of We retired to test this evening at the usual hour and no one could have known by either our appearance or our manners that this was Sunday evening There were no clean clothes amongst us for few of our people were acquainted with the luxury of a suit of clean vestments and those who could afford a clean garment reserved it for Monday morning Sunday is the customary wash-day on cotton plantations It is here proper to observe that it is usual on the cotton estates to deal out the weekly allowance of corn to the slaves on Sunday evening but our overseer at this period had changed this business from Sunday to Monday morning for the reason I believe that he wished to keep the hired people at work in his own cotton field until night He however soon afterwards resumed the practice of distributing the allowance on Sunday evening and continued it as long as I remained on the estate The business was conducted in the same manner when performed on Sunday as when attended to on Monday only the time was changed On Monday morning I heard the sound of the horn at the usual hour and repairing to the front of the overseer's house found that he had already gone to the corn crib for the purpose of distributing corn amongst the people for the bread of the week or rather for the week's subsistence for this corn was all the provision that our master or his overseer usually made for us--I say usually for whatever was given to us beyond the corn which we received on Sunday evening was considered in the light of a bounty bestowed upon us over and beyond what we were entitled to or had a right to expect to receive When I arrived at the crib the door was unlocked and open and the distribution had already commenced Each person was entitled to half a bushel of ears of corn which was measured out by several of the men who were in the crib Every child above six months old drew this weekly allowance of corn and in this way women who had several small children had more corn than they could consume and sometimes bartered small quantities with the other people for such things as they needed and were not able to procure The people received their corn in baskets old bags or any thing with which they could most conveniently provide themselves I had not been able since I came here to procure a basket or any thing else to put my corn in and desired the man with whom I lived to take my portion in his basket with that of his family This he readily agreed to do and as soon as we had received our share we left the crib The overseer attended in person to the measuring of this corn and it is only justice to him to say that he was careful to see that justice was done us The men who measured the corn always heaped the measure as long as an ear would lie on and he never restrained their generosity to their fellow- slaves In addition to this allowance of corn we received a weekly allowance of salt amounting in general to about half a gill to each person but this article was not furnished regularly and sometimes we received none for two or three weeks The reader must not suppose that on this plantation we had nothing to eat beyond the corn and salt This was far from the case I have already described the gardens or patches cultivated by the people and the practice which they universally followed of working on Sunday for wages In addition to all these an industrious managing slave would contrive to gather up a great deal to eat I have before observed that the planters are careful of the health of their slaves and in pursuance of this rule they seldom expose them to rainy weather especially in the sickly seasons of the year if it can be avoided In the spring and early parts of the summer the rains are frequently so violent and the ground becomes so wet that it is injurious to the cotton to work it at least whilst it rains In the course of the year there are many of these rainy days in which the people cannot go to work with safety and it often happens that there is nothing for them to do in the house At such time they make baskets brooms horse collars and other things which they are able to sell amongst the planters The baskets are made of wooden splits and the brooms of young white oak or hickory trees The mats are sometimes made of splits but more frequently of flags as they are called--a kind of tall rush which grows in swampy ground The horse or mule collars are made of husks of corn though sometimes of rushes but the latter are not very durable The money procured by these and various other means which I shall explain hereafter is laid out by the slaves in purchasing such little articles of necessity or luxury as it enables the to procure A part is disbursed in payment for sugar molasses and sometimes a few pounds of coffee for the use of the family another part is laid out for clothes for winter and no inconsiderable portion of his pittance is squandered away by the misguided slave for tobacco and an occasional bottle of rum Tobacco is deemed so indispensable to comfort nay to existence that hunger and nakedness are patiently endured to enable the slave to indulge in this highest of enjoyments There being few towns in the cotton country the shops or stores are frequently kept at some cross road or other public place in or adjacent to a rich district of plantations To these shops the slaves resort sometimes with and at other times without the consent of the overseer for the purpose of laying out the little money they get Notwithstanding all the vigilance that is exercised by the planters the slaves who are no less vigilant than their masters often leave the plantation after the overseer has retired to his bed and go to the store The store-keepers are always ready to accommodate the slaves who are frequently better customers than any white people because the former always pay cash whilst the latter almost always require credit In dealing with the slave the shop-keeper knows he can demand whatever price he pleases for his goods without danger of being charged with extortion and he is ready to rise at any time of the night to oblige friends who are of so much value to him It is held highly disgraceful on the part of store-keepers to deal with the slaves for any thing but money or the coarse fabrics that it is known are the usual products of the ingenuity and industry of the negroes but notwithstanding this a considerable traffic is carried on between the shop-keepers and slaves in which the latter make their payments by barter The utmost caution and severity of masters and overseers are sometimes insufficient to repress the cunning contrivances of the slaves After we had received our corn we deposited it in our several houses and immediately followed the overseer to the same cotton field in which we had been at work on Saturday Our breakfast this morning was bread to which was added a large basket of apples from the orchard of our master These apples served us for a relish with our bread both for breakfast and dinner and when I returned to the quarter in the evening Dinah the name of the woman who was at the head of our family produced at supper a black jug containing molasses and gave me some of the molasses for my supper I felt grateful to Dinah for this act of kindness as I well knew that her children regarded molasses as the greatest of human luxuries and that she was depriving them of their highest enjoyment to afford me the means of making a gourd full of molasses and water I therefore proposed to her and her husband whose name was Nero that whilst I should remain a member of the family I would contribute as much towards its support as Nero himself or at least that I would bring all my earnings into the family stock provided I might be treated as one of its members and be allowed a portion of the proceeds of their patch or garden This offer was very readily accepted and from this time we constituted one community as long as I remained among the field hands on this plantation After supper was over we had to grind our corn but as we had to wait for our turn at the mill we did not get through this indispensable operation before one o'clock in the morning We did not sit up all night to wait for our turn at the mill but as our several turns were assigned us by lot the person who had the first turn when done with the with the mill gave notice to the one entitled to the second and so on By this means nobody lost more than half an hour's sleep and in the morning every one's grinding was done We worked very hard this week We were now laying by the cotton as it is termed that is we were giving the last weeding and hilling to the crop of which there was on this plantation about five hundred acres which looked well and promised to yield a fine picking In addition to the cotton there was on this plantation one hundred acres of corn about ten acres of indigo ten or twelve acres in sweet potatoes and a rice swamp of about fifty acres The potatoes and indigo had been laid by at that is the season of working in them was past before I came upon the estate and we were driven hard by the overseer to get done with the cotton to be ready to give the corn another harrowing and hoeing before the season should be too far advanced Most of the corn in this part of the country was already laid by but the crop here had been planted late and yet required to be worked We were supplied with an abundance of bread for a peck of corn is as much as a man call consume in a week if he has other vegetables with it but we were obliged to provide ourselves with the other articles necessary for our subsistence Nero had corn in his patch which was now hard enough to be fit for boiling and my friend Lydia had beans in her garden We exchanged corn for beans and had a good supply of both but these delicacies we were obliged to reserve for supper We took our breakfast in the field from the cart which seldom afforded us any thing better than bread and some raw vegetables from the garden Nothing of moment occurred amongst us in this first week of my residence here On Wednesday evening called settlement-night two men and a woman were whipped but circumstances of this kind were so common that I shall in future not mention them unless something extraordinary attended them I could make wooden bowls and ladles and went to work with a man who was clearing some new land about two miles off--on the second Sunday of my sojourn here and applied the money I earned in purchasing the tools necessary to enable me to carry on my trade I occupied all my leisure hours for several months after this in making wooden trays and such other wooden vessels as were most in demand These I traded off in part to a storekeeper who lived about five miles from the plantation and for some of my work I obtained money before Christmas I had sold more than thirty dollars worth of my manufactures but the merchant with whom I traded charged such high prices for his goods that I was poorly compensated for my Sunday toils and nightly labours nevertheless by these means I was able to keep our family supplied with molasses and some other luxuries and at the approach of winter I purchased three coarse blankets to which Nero added as many and we had all these made up into blanket-coats for Dinah ourselves and the children About ten days after my arrival we had a great feast at the quarter One night after we had returned from the field the overseer sent for me by his little son and when I came to his house he asked me if I understood the trade of a butcher-- told him I was not a butcher by trade but that I had often assisted my master and others to kill hogs and cattle and that I could dress a hog or a bullock as well as most people He then told me he was going to have a beef killed in the morning at the great house and I must do it--that he would not spare any of the hands to go with me but he would get one of the house-boys to help me When the morning came I went according to orders to butcher the beef which I expected to find in some enclosure on the plantation but the overseer told me I must take a boy named Toney from the house whose business it was to take care of the cattle and go to the woods and look for the beef Toney and I set out sometime before sunrise and went to a cow-pen about a mile from the house where he he had seen the young cattle only a day or two before At this cow-pen we saw several cows waiting to be milked I suppose for their calves were in an adjoining field and separated from them only by a fence Toney then we should have to go to the long savanna where the dry cattle generally ranged and thither we set off This long savanna lay at the distance of three miles from the cow-pen and when we reached it I found it to be literally what it was called a long savanna It was a piece of low swampy ground several miles in extent with an open space in the interior part of it about a mile long and perhaps a quarter of a mile in width It was manifest that this open space was covered with water through the greater part of the year which prevented the growth of timber in this place though at the time it was dry except a pond near one end which covered perhaps an acre of ground In this natural meadow every kind of wild grass common to such places in the southern country abounded Here I first saw the scrub and saw grasses--the first of which is so hard and rough that it is gathered to scrub coarse wooden furniture or even pewter and the last is provided with edges somewhat like saw teeth so hard and sharp that it would soon tear the skin off the legs of any one who should venture to walk through it with bare limbs As we entered this savanna we were enveloped in clouds of musquitos and swarm of galinippers that threatened to devour us As we advanced through the grass they rose up until the air was thick and actually darkened with them They rushed upon us with the fury of yellow-jackets whose hive has been broken in upon and covered every part of our persons The clothes I had on which were nothing but a shirt and trousers of tow linen afforded no protection even against the musquitos which were much larger than those found along the Chesapeake Bay and nothing short of a covering of leather could have defended me against the galinippers I was pierced by a thousand stings at a time and verily believe I could not have lived beyond a few hours in this place Toney ran into the pond and rolled himself in the water to get rid of his persecutors but he had not been long there before he came running out as fast as he had gone in hallooing and clamouring in a manner wholly unintelligible to me He was terribly frightened but I could not imagine what could be the cause of his alarm until he reached the shore when he turned round with his face to the water and called out-- the biggest alligator in the whole world--did not you see him I told him I had not seen any thing but himself in the water but he insisted that he had been chased in the pond by an alligator which had followed him until he was close to the shore We waited a few minutes for the alligator to rise to the surface but were soon compelled by the musquitos to quit this place Toney we need not look for the cattle here no cattle could live amongst these musquitos and I thought he was right in his judgment We then proceeded into the woods and thickets and after wandering about for an hour or more we found the cattle and after much difficulty succeeded in driving a part of the back to the cow-pen and enclosing them in it I here selected the one that appeared to me to be the fattest and securing it with ropes we drove the animal to the place of slaughter This beef was intended as a feast for the slaves at the laying by of the corn and cotton and when I had it hung up and had taken the hide off my young master who I had seen on the day of my arrival came out to me and ordered me to cut off the head neck legs and tail and lay them together with the empty stomach and the harslet in a basket This basket was sent home to the kitchen of the great house by a woman and a boy who attended for that purpose I think there was at least one hundred and twenty or thirty pounds of this offal The residue of the carcass I cut into four quarters and we carried it to the cellar of the great house Here one of the hind quarters was salted in a tub for the use of the family and the other was sent as a present to a planter who lived about four miles distant The two fore-quarters were cut into very small pieces and salted by themselves These I was told would be cooked for our dinner on the next day Sunday when there was to be a general rejoicing amongst all the slaves of the plantation After the beef was salted down I received some bread and milk for my breakfast and went to join the hands in the corn field where they were now harrowing and hoeing the crop for the last time The overseer had promised us that we should have holiday after the completion of this work and by great exertion we finished it about five o'clock in the afternoon On our return to the quarter the overseer at roll-call-- which he performed this day before night-- told us that every family must send a bowl to the great house to get our dinners of meat This intelligence diffused as much joy amongst us as if each one had drawn a prize in a lottery At the assurance of a meat dinner the old people smiled and showed their teeth and returned thanks to master overseer but many of the younger ones shouted clapped their hands leaped and ran about with delight Each family or mess now sent its deputy with a large wooden bowl in his hand to receive the dinner at the great kitchen I went on the part of our family and found that the meat dinner of this day was made up of the basket of tripe and other offal that I had prepared in the morning The whole had been boiled in four great iron kettles until the flesh had disappeared from the bones which were broken in small pieces--a flitch of bacon some green corn squashes tomatos and onions had been added together with other condiments and the whole converted into about a hundred gallons of soup of which I received in my bowl for the use of our family more than two gallons We had plenty of bread and a supply of black-eyed peas gathered from our garden some of which Dinah had boiled in our kettle whilst I was gone for the soup of which there was as much as we could consume and I believe that every one in the quarter had enough I doubt if there was in the world a happier assemblage than ours on this Saturday evening We had finished one of the grand divisions of the labours of a cotton plantation and were supplied with a dinner which to the most of my fellow-slaves appeared to be a great luxury and most liberal donation on the part of our master who they regarded with sentiments of gratitude for this manifestation of his bounty In addition to present gratification they looked forward to the enjoyments of the next day when they were to spend a whole Sunday in rest and banqueting for it was known that the two fore-quarters of the bullock were to be dressed for Sunday's dinner and I had told them that each of these quarters weighed at least one hundred pounds Our quarter knew but little quiet this night singing-- playing on the banjoe and dancing occupied nearly the whole community until the break of day Those who were too old to take any part in our active pleasures beat time with their hands or recited stories of former times Most of these stories referred to affairs that had been transacted in Africa and were sufficiently fraught with demons miracles and murders to fix the attention of many hearers To add to our happiness the early peaches were now ripe and the overseer permitted us to send on Sunday morning to the orchard and gather at least ten bushels of very fine fruit In South Carolina they have very good summer apples but they fall from the trees and rot immediately after they are ripe indeed very often they speck-rot on the trees before they become ripe This speck-rot as it is termed appears to be a kind of epidemic disease amongst apples for in some seasons whole orchards are subject to it and the fruit is totally worthless whilst in other years the fruit in the same orchard continues sound and good until it is ripe The climate of Carolina is however not favourable to the apple and this fruit of so much value in the north is in the cotton region only of a few weeks continuance--winter apples being unknown Every climate is congenial to the growth of some kind of fruit tree and in Carolina and Georgia the peach arrives at its utmost perfection the fig also ripens well and is a delicious fruit None of our people went out to work for wages to-day Some few devoted a part of the morning to such work as they deemed necessary in or about their patches and some went to the woods or the swamps to collect sticks for brooms and splits or to gather flags for mats but far the greater number remained at the quarter occupied in some small work or quietly awaiting the hour of dinner which we had been informed by one of the house-servants would be at one o'clock Every family made ready some preparation of vegetables from their own garden to enlarge the quantity if not to heighten the flavour of the dinner of this day One o'clock at length arrived but not before it had been long desired and we proceeded with our bowls a second time to the great kitchen I acted as I had done yesterday the part of commissary for our family but when we were already at the place where we were to receive our soup and meat into our bowls for it was understood that we were with the soup to have an allowance of both beef and bacon to-day we were told that puddings had been boiled for us and that we must bring dishes to receive them in This occasioned some delay until we obtained vessels from the quarter In addition to at least two gallons of soup about a pound of beef and a small piece of bacon I obtained nearly two pounds of pudding made of corn meal mixed with lard and boiled in large bags This pudding with the molasses that we had at home formed a very palatable second course to our bread soup and vegetables On Sunday afternoon we had a meeting at which many of our party attended A man named Jacob who had come from Virginia sang and prayed but a great many of the people went out about the plantation in search of fruits for there were many peach and some fig trees standing along the fences on various parts of the estate With us this was a day of uninterrupted happiness A man cannot well be miserable when he sees every one about him immersed in pleasure and though our fare of to-day was not of a quality to yield me much gratification yet such was the impulse given to my feelings by the universal hilarity and contentment which prevailed amongst my fellows that I forgot for the time all the subjects of grief that were stored in my memory all the acts of wrong that had been perpetrated against me and entered with the most sincere and earnest sentiments in the participation of the felicity of our community XII At the time of which I now speak the rice was ripe and ready to be gathered On Monday morning after our feast the overseer took the whole of us to the rice field to enter upon the harvest of this crop The field lay in a piece of low ground near the river and in such a position that it could be flooded by the water of the stream in wet seasons The rice is planted in drills or rows and grows more like oats than any of the other grain known in the north The water is sometimes let in to the rice fields and drawn off again several times according to the state of the weather Watering and weeding the rice is considered one of the most unhealthy occupations on a southern plantation as the people are obliged to live for several weeks in the mud and water subject to all the unwholesome vapours that arise from stagnant pools under the rays of a summer sun as well as the chilly autumnal dews of night At the time we came to cut this rice the field was quite dry and after we had reaped and bound it we hauled it upon wagons to a piece of hard ground where we made a threshing floor and threshed it In some places they tread out the rice with mules or horses as they tread wheat in Maryland but this renders the grain dusty and is injurious to its sale After getting in the rice we were occupied for some time in clearing and ditching swampy land preparatory to a more extended culture of rice the next year and about the first of August twenty or thirty of the people principally women and children were employed for two weeks in making cider of apples which grew in an orchard of nearly two hundred trees that stood on a part of the estate After the cider was made a barrel of it was one day brought to the field and distributed amongst us but this gratuity was not repeated The cider that was made by the people was converted into brandy at a still in the corner of the orchard I often obtained cider to drink at the still which was sheltered from the weather by a shed of boards and slabs We were not permitted to go into the orchard at pleasure but as long as the apples continued we were allowed the privilege of sending five or six persons every evening for the purpose of bringing apples to the quarter for our common use and by taking large baskets and filling them well we generally contrived to get as many as we could consume When the peaches ripened they were guarded with more rigour--peach brandy being an article which is nowhere more highly prized than in South Carolina There were on the plantation more than a thousand peach trees growing on poor sandy fields which were no longer worth the expense of cultivation The best peaches grow upon the poorest sandhills We were allowed to take three bushels of peaches every day for the use of the quarter but we could and did eat at least three times that quantity for we stole at night that which was not given us by day I confess that I took part in these thefts and I do not feel that I committed any wrong against either God or man by my participation in the common danger that we ran for we well knew the consequences that would have followed detection After the feast at laying by the corn and cotton we had no meat for several weeks and it is my opinion that our master lost money by the economy he practised at this season of the year In the month of August we had to save the fodder This fodder-saving is the most toilsome and next to working in the rice swaps the most unhealthy job that has to be performed on a cotton plantation in the whole year The manner of doing it is to cut the tops from the corn as is done in Pennsylvania but in addition to this the blades below the ear are always pulled off by the hand Great pains is taken with these corn-blades They constitute the chosen food of race and all other horses that are intended to be kept with extraordinary care and in superior condition For the purpose of procuring the best blades they are frequently stripped from the stock sometimes before the corn is ripe enough in the ear to permit the top of the stalk to be cut off without prejudice to the grain After the blades are stripped from the stem they are stuck between the hills of corn until they are cured ready for the stack They are then cut and bound in sheaves with small bands of the blades themselves This binding and the subsequent hauling from the field must be done either early in the morning before the dew is dried up or in the night whilst the dew is falling This work exposes the people who do it to the fogs and damps of the climate at the most unhealthy season of the year Agues fevers and all the diseases which follow in their train have their dates at the time of fodder-saving It is the only work appertaining to a cotton estate which must of necessity be done in the night or in the fogs of the morning and the people at this season of the year and whilst engaged in this very fatiguing work would certainly be better able to go through with it if they were regularly supplied with proper portions of sound and wholesome salted provisions If every master would through the months of August and September supply his people with only a quarter of a pound of good bacon flitch to each person daily I have no doubt but that he would save money by it to say nothing of the great comfort it would yield to the slaves at this period when the human frame is so subject to debility and feebleness Early in August disease made its appearance amongst us Several were attacked by the ague with its accompanying fever but in South Carolina the ague as it is called is scarcely regarded as a disease and if a slave has no ailment that is deemed more dangerous he is never withdrawn from the roll of the field hands I have seen many of our poor people compelled to pick cotton when their frames were shaken so violently by the ague that they were unable to get hold of the cotton in the burs without difficulty In this masters commit a great error Many fine slaves are lost by this disease which superinduces the dropsy and sometimes the consumption which could have been prevented by arresting the ague at its onset When any of our people were taken so ill that they were not able to go to the field they were removed to the great house and placed in the sick room as it was termed This sick room was a large airy apartment in the second story of a building which stood in the garden The lower part of this building was divided into two apartments in one of which was kept the milk butter and other things connected with the dairy In the other the salt provisions of the family including fish bacon and other articles were secured This apartment also constituted the smoke house but as the ceiling was lathed and plastered with a thick coat of lime and sand no smoke could penetrate the sick room which was at all seasons of the year a very comfortable place to sleep in Though I was never sick myself whilst on this plantation I was several times in this sick room and always observed when there that the sick slaves were well attended to There a hanging partition which could be let down at pleasure and which was let down when it was necessary to divide the rooms into two apartments which always happened when there were several slaves of different sexes sick at the same time The beds upon which the sick lay were of straw but clean and wholesome and the patients when once in this room were provided with every thing necessary for persons in their situation A physician attended them daily and proper food and even wines were not wanting The contrast between the cotton and rice fields and this little hospital was very great and it appeared to me at the time that if a part of the tenderness and benevolence displayed here had been bestowed upon the people whilst in good health very many of the inmates of this infirmary would never have been here I have often seen the same misapplication of the principles of philanthropy in Pennsylvania--the subjects only being varied from slaves to horses The finest and most valuable horses are often overworked or driven beyond their capacity of endurance it cannot be that horses are not generally well fed in Pennsylvania without mercy or consideration on the part of their owners or more frequently of unfeeling hirelings who have no interest in the life of the poor animal and when his constitution is broken and his health gone great care and even expense are bestowed upon him for the purpose of restoring him to his former strength the one half of which care or expense would have preserved him in beauty and vigour had they been bestowed upon him before he had suffered the irreparable injuries attendant upon his cruel treatment In Pennsylvania the horse is regarded and justly regarded only on account of the labour he is able to perform Being the subject of property his owner considers not how he shall add most to the comforts and enjoyments of his horse but by what means he shall be able to procure the greatest amount of labour from him with the least expense to himself In devising the means of saving expense the life of the horse and the surest and cheapest method of its preservation are taken into consideration Precisely in this way do the cotton planters reason and act in relation to their slaves Regarding the negroes merely as objects of property like prudent calculators they study how to render this property of the greatest value and to obtain the greatest yearly income from the capital invested in the slaves and the lands they cultivate Experience has proved to me that a man who eats no animal food may yet be healthy and able to perform the work usually done on a cotton plantation Corn bread sweet potatoes some garden vegetables with a little molasses and salt assisted by the other accidental supplies that a thrifty slave is able to procure on a plantation are capable of sustaining life and health and a slave who lives on such food and never tastes flesh stands at least an equal chance for long life with his master or mistress who are clad in purple and fine linen and fare sumptuously every day More people are killed by eating and drinking too much than die of the effects of starvation in the south but the diseases of the white man do not diminish the sufferings of the black one A man who lives upon vegetable diet may be healthy and active but I know he is not so strong and vigorous as if he enjoyed a portion of animal food The labour usually performed by slaves on a cotton plantation does not require great bodily strength but rather superior agility and wakefulness The hoes in use are not heavy and the art of picking cotton depends not upon superior strength but upon the power of giving quick and accelerated motion to the fingers arms and legs The fences have to be made and repaired and ditches dug--wood must also be cut for many purposes and all these operations call for strength but they consume only a very small portion of the whole year--more than three fourths of which is spent in the cotton corn rice and indigo fields where the strength of a boy or a woman is sufficient to perform any kind of labour necessary in the culture of the plants but men are able to do more even of this work than either boys or women We scarcely had time to complete the securing of the fodder and working up the apples and peaches when the cotton was ready for picking This business of picking cotton constitutes about half the labour of the year on a large plantation In Carolina it is generally commenced about the first of September though in some years much cotton is picked in August The manner of doing the work is this The cotton being planted in hills in straight rows from four to five feet apart each hand or picker provided with a bag made of cotton bagging holding a bushel or more hung round the neck with cords proceeds from one side of the field to the other between two of these rows picking all the cotton from the open burs on the right and left as he goes It is the business of the picker to take all the cotton from each of the rows as far as the lines of the rows or hills In this way he picks half the cotton from each of the rows and the pickers who come on his right and left take the remainder from the opposite sides of the rows The cotton is gathered into the bag and when it becomes burdensome by its weight it is deposited in some convenient place until night when it is taken home either in a large bag or basket and weighed under the inspection of the overseer A day's work is not estimated by the number of hills or rows that are picked in the day but by the number of pounds of cotton in the seed that the picker brings into the cotton house at night In a good field of cotton fully ripe a day's work is sixty pounds but where the cotton is of inferior quality or the burs are not in full blow fifty pounds is the day's work and where the cotton is poor or in bad order forty or even thirty pounds is as much as one hand can get in a day The picking of cotton continues from August until December or January and in some fields they pick from the old plants until they are ploughed up in February or March to make room for the planting of the seeds of another crop On all estates the standard of a day's work is fixed by the overseer according to the quality of the cotton and if a hand gathers more than this standard he is paid for it but if on the other hand when his or her cotton is weighed at the cotton-house in the evening it is found that the standard quantity has not been picked the delinquent picker is sure to receive a whipping On some estates settlements are made every evening and the whipping follows immediately on others the whipping does not occur until the next morning whilst on a few plantations the accounts are closed twice or three times a week I have stated heretofore that our overseer whipped twice a week for the purpose of saving time but if this method saved time to the overseer and the hands it also saved the latter of a great many hard stripes for very often when one of us had displeased the overseer he would tell us that on Wednesday or Saturday night as the case might be we should be remembered yet the matter was either forgotten or the passion of the overseer subdued before the time of retribution arrived and the delinquent escaped altogether from the punishment which would certainly have fallen upon him if it had been the custom of the overseer to chastise for every offence at the moment or even on the day of its perpetration A short day's work was always punished The cotton does not all ripen at the same time on the same plant which is picked and repicked from six to ten times The burs ripen and burst open on the lower branches of the plant whilst those at the top are yet in flower or perhaps only in leaf or bud The plant grows on taller and larger until it is arrested by the frost or cool weather in autumn continually throwing out new branches new stems new blossoms and new burs ceasing only with the first frost at which time there are always some green burs at the top of the plant that never arrive at maturity This state of things is however often prevented by topping the plant in August or September which prevents it from throwing out new branches and blossoms and forwards the growth and ripening of those already formed The first picking takes the cotton from the burs of the lowest branches the second from those a little higher and so on until those of the latest growth at the top of the plant are reached When the season has been bad or from any other cause the crop is light the picking is sometimes complete and the field clear of the cotton before the first of January but when the crop is heavy or the people have been sickly in the fall the picking is frequently protracted until February or even the first of March The winter does not injure the cotton standing in the field though the wind blows some of it out of the expanded burs which is thus scattered over the field and lost An acre of prime land will yield two thousand pounds of cotton in the seed I have heard of three thousand pounds having been picked from an acre but have not seen it Four pounds of cotton in the seed yields one pound when cleaned and prepared for market It is estimated by the planters or rather by the overseers that a good hand can cultivate and pick five acres of cotton and raise as much corn as will make his bread and feed a mule or a horse I know this to be a very hard task for a single hand if the land is good and the crops at all luxuriant One man may with great diligence and continued good health be able to get through with the cotton and two or three or even five acres of corn up to the time when the cotton is ready to be picked but from this period he will find the labour more than he can perform if the cotton is to be picked clean from the plants Five acres of good cotton will yield ten thousand pounds of rough or seed cotton If he can pick sixty pounds a day and works twenty-five days in a month the picking of ten thousand pounds will occupy him more than six months From my own observations on the plantations of South Carolina and Georgia I am of opinion that the planters in those states do not get more than six or seven thousand pounds of cotton in the seed for each hand employed and I presume that fifteen hundred pounds of clean cotton is a full average of the product of the labour of each hand I now entered upon a new scene of life My true value had not yet been ascertained by my present owner and whether I was to hold the rank of a first or second rate hand could only be determined by an experience of my ability to pick cotton nor was this important trait in my character to be fully understood by a trial of one or only a few days It requires some time to enable a stranger or new hand to acquire the sleight of picking cotton I had ascertained that at the hoe the spade the axe the sickle or the flan I was a full match for the best hands on the plantation but soon discovered when we came to the picking of cotton that I was not equal to a boy of twelve or fifteen years of age I worked hard the first day and made every effort to sustain the character that I had acquired amongst my companions but when evening came and our cotton was weighed I had only thirty-eight pounds and was vexed to see that two younger men about my own age had one fifty-eight and the other fifty-nine pounds This was our first day's work and the overseer had not yet settled the amount of a day's picking It was necessary for him to ascertain by the experience of a few days how much the best hands could pick in a day before he established the standard of the season I hung down my head and felt very much ashamed of myself when I found that my cotton was so far behind that of many even of the women who had heretofore regarded me as the strongest and most powerful man of the whole gang I had exerted myself to-day to the utmost of my power and as the picking of cotton seemed to be so very simple a business I felt apprehensive that I should never be able to improve myself so far as to become even a second rate hand In this posture of affairs I looked forward to something still more painful than loss of character which I must sustain both with my fellows and my master for I knew that the lash of the overseer would soon become familiar with my back if I did not perform as much work as any of the other young men I expected indeed that it would go hard with me even now and stood by with feelings of despondence and terror whilst the other people were getting their cotton weighed When it was all weighed the overseer came to me where I stood and told me to show him my hands When I had done this and he had looked at them he observed--You have a pair of good hands--you will make a good picker This faint praise of the overseer revived my spirits greatly and I went home with a lighter heart than I had expected to possess before the termination of cotton-picking When I came to get my cotton weighed on the evening of the second day I was rejoiced to find that I had forty-six pounds although I had not worked harder than I did the first day On the third evening I had fifty-two pounds and before the end of the week there were only three hands in the field--two men and a young woman--who could pick more cotton in a day than I could On the Monday morning of the second week when we went to the field the overseer told us that he fixed the days work at fifty pounds and that all those who picked more than that would be paid a cent a pound for the overplus Twenty-five pounds was assigned as the daily task of the old people as well as a number of boys and girls whilst some of the women who had children were required to pick forty pounds and several children had ten pounds each as their task Picking of cotton may almost be reckoned among the arts A man who has arrived at the age of twenty-five before he sees a cotton field will never in the language of the overseer become a crack picker By great industry and vigilance I was able at the end of a month to return every evening a few pounds over the daily rate for which I received my pay but the business of picking cotton was an irksome and fatiguing labour to me and one to which I could never become thoroughly reconciled for the reason I believe that in every other kind of work in which I was engaged in the south I was able to acquire the character of a first rate hand whilst in picking cotton I was hardly regarded as a prime hand XIII In a community of near three hundred persons governed by laws as severe and unbending as which regulated our actions it is not to be expected that universal content can prevail or that crimes will not be imagined and even sometimes perpetrated Ignorant men estimate those things which fortune has placed beyond their reach not by their real value but by the strength of their own desires and passions Objects in themselves indifferent which they are forbidden to touch or even approach excite in the minds of the unreflecting ungovernable impulses The slave who is taught from infancy to regard his condition as unchangeable and his fate as fixed by the laws of nature fancies that he sees his master in possession of that happiness which he knows has been denied to himself The lower men are sunk in the scale of civilization the more violent become their animal passions The native Africans are revengeful and unforgiving in their tempers easily provoked and cruel in their designs They generally place little or even no value upon fine houses and superb furniture of their masters and discover no beauty in the fair complexions and delicate forms of their mistresses They feel indignant at the servitude that is imposed upon them and only want power to inflict the most cruel retribution upon their oppressors but they desire only the means of subsistence and temporary gratification in this country during their abode here They are universally of opinion and this opinion is founded in their religion that after death they shall return to their own country and rejoin their former companions and friends in some happy region in which they will be provided with plenty of food and beautiful women from the lovely daughters of their own native land The case is different with the American negro who knows nothing of Africa her religion or customs and who has borrowed all his ideas of present and future happiness from the opinions and intercourse of white people and of Christians He is perhaps not so impatient of slavery and excessive labour as the native of Congo but his mind is bent upon other pursuits and his discontent works out for itself other schemes than those which agitate the brain of the imported negro His heart pants for no heaven beyond the waves of the ocean and he dreams of no delights in the arms of sable beauties in groves of immortality on the banks of the Niger or the Gambia nor does he often solace himself with the reflection that the clay wilt arrive when all men will receive the awards of immutable justice and live together in eternal bliss without any other distinctions than those of superior virtue and exalted mercy Circumstances oppose great obstacles in the way of these opinions The slaves who are natives of the country I now speak of the mass of those on the cotton plantations as I knew them like all other people who suffer wrong in this world are exceedingly prone to console themselves with the delights of a future state when the evil that has been endured in this life will not only be abolished and all injuries be compensated by proper rewards bestowed upon the sufferers but as they have learned that wickedness is to be punished as well as goodness compensated they do not stop at the point of their own enjoyments and pleasures but believe that those who have tormented them here will most surely be tormented in their turn hereafter The gross and carnal minds of these slaves are not capable of arriving at the sublime doctrines taught by the white preachers in which they are encouraged to look forward to the day when all distinctions of colour and of condition will be abolished and they shall sit down in the same paradise with their masters mistresses and even with the overseer They are ready enough to receive the faith which conducts them to heaven and eternal rest on account of their present sufferings but they by no means so willingly admit the master and mistress to an equal participation in their enjoyments-- this would only be partial justice and half way retribution According to their notions the master and mistress are to be in future the companions of wicked slaves whilst an agreeable recreation of the celestial inhabitants of the negro's heaven will be a return to the overseer of the countless lashes that he has lent out so liberally here It is impossible to reconcile the mind of the native slave to the idea of living in a state of perfect equality and boundless affection with the white people Heaven will be no heaven to him if he is not to be avenged of his enemies I know from experience that these are the fundamental rules of his religious creed because I learned them in the religious meetings of the slaves themselves A favourite and kind master or mistress may now and then be admitted into heaven but this rather as a matter of favour to the intercession of some slave than as matter of strict justice to the whites who will by no means be of an equal rank with those who shall be raised from the depths of misery in this world The idea of a revolution in the conditions of the whites and the blacks is the corner-stone of the religion of the latter and indeed it seems to me at least to be quite natural if not in strict accordance with the precepts of the Bible for in that book I find it every where laid down that those who have possessed an inordinate portion of the good things of this world and have lived in ease and luxury at the expense of their fellow men will surely have to render an account of their stewardship and be punished for having withheld from others the participation of those blessings which they themselves enjoyed There is no subject which presents the mind of the male slave a greater contrast between his own condition and that of his master than the relative station and appearance of his wife and his mistress The one poorly clad poorly fed and exposed to all the hardships of the cotton field the other dressed in clothes of gay and various colours ornamented with jewelry and carefully protected from the rays of the sun and the blasts of the wind As I have before observed the Africans have feelings peculiar to themselves but with an American slave the possession of the spacious house splendid furniture and fine horses of his master are but the secondary objects of his desires To fill the measure of his happiness and crown his highest ambition his young and beautiful mistress must adorn his triumph and enliven his hopes I have been drawn into the above reflections by the recollection of an event of a most melancholy character which took place when I had been on this plantation about three months Amongst the house-servants of my master was a young man named Hardy of a dark yellow complexion--a quadroon or mulatto--one fourth of whose blood was transmitted from white parentage Hardy was employed in various kinds of work about the house and was frequently sent of errands sometimes on horseback I had become acquainted with the boy who had often come to see me at the quarter and had sometimes staid all night with me and often told me of the ladies and gentlemen who visited at the great house Amongst others he frequently spoke of a young lady who resided six or seven miles from the plantation and often came to visit the daughters of the family in company with her brother a lad about twelve or fourteen years of age He described the great beauty of this girl whose mother was a widow living on a small estate of her own This lady did not keep a carriage but her son and daughter when they went abroad travelled on horseback One Sunday these two young people came to visit at the house of my master and remained until after tea in the evening As I did not go out to work that day I went over to the great house and from the house to a place in the woods about a mile distant where I had set snares for rabbits This place was near the road and I saw the young lady and her brother on their way home It was after sundown when they passed me but as the evening was clear and pleasant I supposed they would get home soon after dark and that no accident would befall them No more was thought of the matter this evening and I heard nothing further of the young people until the next day about noon when a black boy came into the field where we were picking cotton and went to the overseer with a piece of paper In a short time the overseer called me to come with him and leaving the field with the hands under the orders of Simon the first captain we proceeded to the great house As soon as we arrived at the mansion my master who had not spoken to me since the day we came from Columbia appeared at the front door and ordered me to come in and follow him He led me through a part of the house and passed into the back yard where I saw the young gentleman his son another gentleman whom I did not know the family doctor and the overseer all standing together and in earnest conversation At my appearance the overseer opened a cellar door and ordered me to go in I had no suspicion of evil and obeyed the order immediately as indeed I must have obeyed it whatever might have been my suspicions The overseer and the gentlemen all followed and as soon as the cellar door was closed after us by some one whom I could not see I was ordered to pull off my clothes and lie down on my back I was then bound by the hands and feet with strong cords and extended at full length between two of the beams that supported the timbers of the building The stranger who I now observed was much agitated spoke to the doctor who then opened a small case of surgeons' instruments which he took from his pocket and told me he was going to skin me for what I had done last night But the doctor before you are skinned you had better confess your crime What crime master shall I confess I have committed no crime--what has been done that you are going to murder me was my reply My master then asked me why I had followed the young lady and her brother who went from the house the evening before and murdered her Astonished and terrified at the charge of being a murderer I knew not what to say and only continued the protestations of my innocence and my entreaties not to be put to death My young master was greatly enraged against me and loaded me with maledictions and imprecations and his father appeared to be as well satisfied as he was of my guilt but was more calm and less vociferous in his language The doctor during this time was assorting his instruments and looking at me--then stooping down and feeling my pulse he it would not do to skin a man so full of blood as I was I should bleed so much that he could not see to do his work and he should probably cut some large vein or artery by which I should bleed to death in a few minutes it was necessary to bleed me in the arms for some time so as to reduce the quantity of blood that was in me before taking my skin off He then bound a string round my right arm and opened a vein near the middle of the arm from which the blood ran in a large and smooth stream I already began to feel faint with the loss of blood when the cellar door was thrown open and several persons came down with two lighted candles I looked at these people attentively as they came near and stood around me and expressed their satisfaction at the just and dreadful punishment that I was about to undergo Their faces were all new and unknown to me except that of a lad whom I recognized as the same who had ridden by me the preceding evening in company with his sister My old master spoke to this boy by name and told him to come and see the murderer of his sister receive his due The boy was a pretty youth and wore his hair long on the top of his head in the fashion of that day As he came round near my head the light of a candle which the doctor held in his hand shone full in my face and seeing that the eyes of the boy met mine I determined to make one more effort to save my life and to him in as calm a tone as I could Young master did I murder young mistress your sister The youth immediately looked at my master and This is not the man--this man has short wool and he had long wool like your Hardy My life was saved I was snatched from the most horrible of tortures and from a slow and painful death I was unbound the bleeding of my arm stopped and I was suffered to put on my clothes and go up into the back yard of the house where I was required to tell what I knew of the young lady and her brother on the previous day I stated that I had seen them in the court yard of the house at the time I was in the kitchen that I had then gone to the woods to set my snares and had seen them pass along the road near me and that this was all the knowledge I had of them The boy was then required to examine me particularly and ascertain whether I was or was not the man who had murdered his sister He he had not seen me at the place where I stated I was and that he was confident I was not the person who had attacked him and his sister That my hair or wool as he called it was short but that of the man who committed the crime was long like Hardy's and that he was about the size of Hardy--not so large as I was but black like me and not yellow like Hardy Some one now asked where Hardy was and he was called for but could not be found in the kitchen Persons were sent to the quarter and other places in quest of him but returned without him Hardy was nowhere to be found Whilst this inquiry or rather search was going on perceiving that my old master had ceased to look upon me as a murderer I asked him to please to tell me what had happened that had been so near proving fatal to me I was now informed that the young lady who had left the house on the previous evening in company with her brother had been assailed on the road about four miles off by a black man who had sprung from a thicket and snatched her horse as she was riding at a short distance behind her brother That the assassin as soon as she was on the ground struck her horse a blow with a long stick which together with the fright caused by the screams of its rider when torn from it had caused it to fly off at full speed and the horse of the brother also taking fright followed in pursuit notwithstanding all the exertions of the lad to stop it All the account the brother could give of the matter was that as his horse ran with him he saw the negro drag his sister into the woods and heard her screams for a short time He was not able to stop his horse until he reached home when he gave information to his mother and her family That people had been scouring the woods all night and all the morning without being able to find the young lady When intelligence of this horrid crime was brought to the house of my master Hardy was the first to receive it he having gone to take the horse of the person--a young gentleman of the neighbourhood-- who bore it and who immediately returned to join his friends in their search for the dead body As soon as the messenger was gone Hardy had come to my master and told him that if he would prevent me from murdering him he would disclose the perpetrator of the crime He was then ordered to communicate all he knew on the subject and declared that having gone into the woods the day before to hunt squirrels he staid until it was late and on his return home hearing the shrieks of a woman he had proceeded cautiously to the place but before he could arrive at the spot the cries had ceased nevertheless he had found me after some search with the body of the young lady whom I had just killed and that I was about to kill him too with a hickory club but he had saved his life by promising that he would never betray me He was glad to leave me and what I had done with the body he did not know Hardy was known in the neighbourhood and his character had been good I was a stranger and on inquiry the black people in the kitchen supported Hardy by saying that I had been seen going to the woods before night by the way of the road which the deceased had travelled These circumstances were deemed conclusive against me by my master and as the offence of which I was believed to be guilty was the highest that can be committed by a slave according to the opinion of owners it was determined to punish me in a way unknown to the law and to inflict tortures upon me which the law would not tolerate I was now released and though very weak from the effects of bleeding I was yet able to return to my own lodgings I had no doubt that Hardy was the perpetrator of the crime for which I was so near losing my life and now recollected that when I was at the kitchen of the great house on Sunday he had disappeared a short time before sundown as I had looked for him when I was going to set my snares but could not find him I went back to the house and communicated this fact to my master By this time nearly twenty white men had collected about the dwelling with the intention of going to search for the body of the lost lady but it was now resolved to make the look-out double and to give it the twofold character of a pursuit of the living as well as a seeking for the dead I now returned to my lodgings in the quarter and soon fell into a profound sleep from which I did not awake until long after night when all was quiet and the stillness of undisturbed tranquillity prevailed over our little community I felt restless and sunk into a labyrinth of painful reflections upon the horrid and perilous condition from which I had this day escaped as it seemed merely by chance and as I slept until all sensations of drowsiness had left me I rose from my bed and walked out by the light of the moon which was now shining After being in the open air some time I thought of the snares that I had set on Sunday evening and determined to go and see if they had taken any game I sometimes caught oppossums in my snares and as these animals were very fat at this season of the year I felt a hope that I might be fortunate enough to get one tonight I had been at my snares and had returned as far as the road near where I had seen the young lady and her brother on horseback on Sunday evening and had seated myself under the boughs of a holly bush that grew there It so happened that the place where I sat was in the shade of the bush within a few feet of the road but screened from it by some small boughs In this position which I had taken by accident I could see a great distance along the road towards the end of my master's lane Though covered as I was by the shade and enveloped in boughs it was difficult for a person in the road to see me The occurrence that had befallen me in the course of the previous day had rendered me nervous and easily susceptible of all the emotions of fear I had not been long in this place when I thought I heard sounds as of a person walking on the ground at a quick pace and looking along the road towards the lane I saw the form of some one passing through a space in the road where the beams of the moon piercing between two trees reached the ground When the moving body passed into the shade I could not see it but in a short time it came so near that I could distinctly see that it was a man approaching me by the road When he came opposite me and the moon shone full in his face I knew him to be a young mulatto named David the coachman of a widow lady who resided somewhere near Charleston but who had been at the house of my master for two or three weeks as a visiter with her two daughters This man passed on at a quick step without observing me and the suspicion instantly riveted itself in my mind that he was the murderer for whose crime I had already suffered so much and that he was now on his way to the place where he had left the body for the purpose of removing or burying it in the earth I was confident that no honest purpose could bring him to this place at this time of night alone I was about two miles from home and an equal distance from the spot where the girl had been seized Of her subsequent murder no one entertained a doubt for it was not to be expected that the fellow who had been guilty of one great crime would flinch from the commission of another of equal magnitude and suffer his victim to exist as a witness to identify his person I felt animated by a spirit of revenge against the wretch whoever he might be who had brought me so near to torture and death and feeble and weak as I was resolved to pursue the foot-steps of this coachman at a wary and cautious distance and ascertain if possible the object of his visit to these woods at this time of night I waited until he had passed me more than a hundred yards and until I could barely discover his form in the faint light of the deep shade of the trees when stealing quietly into the road I followed with the caution of a spy traversing the camp of an enemy We were now in a dark pine forest and on both sides of us were tracts of low swampy ground covered with thickets so dense as to be difficult of penetration even by a person on foot The road led along a neck of elevated and dry ground that divided these swamps for more than a mile when they terminated and were succeeded by ground that produced scarcely any other timber than a scrubby kind of oak called black jack It was amongst these black jacks about half a mile beyond the swamps that the lady had been carried off I had often been here for the purpose of snaring and trapping the small game of these woods and was well acquainted with the topography of this forest for some distance on both sides of the road It was necessary for me to use the utmost caution in the enterprise I was now engaged in The road we were now travelling was in no place very broad and at some points barely wide enough to permit a carriage to pass between the trees that lined its sides In some places it was so dark that I could not see the man whose steps I followed but was obliged to depend on the sound produced by the tread of his feet upon the ground I deemed it necessary to keep as close as possible to the object of my pursuit lest he should suddenly turn into the swamp on one side or the other of the road and elude my vigilance for I had no doubt that he would quit the road somewhere As we approached the termination of the low grounds my anxiety became intense lest he should escape me and at one time I could not have been more than one hundred feet behind him but he continued his course until he reached the oak woods and came to a place where an old cart-road led off to the left along the side of the Dark Swamp as it was termed in the neighbourhood This road the mulatto took without turning to look behind him Here my difficulties and perils increased for I now felt myself in danger as I had no longer any doubt that I was on the trail of the murderer and that if discovered by him my life would be the price of my curiosity I was too weak to be able to struggle with him for a minute though if the blood which I had lost through his wickedness could have been restored to my veins I could have seized him by the neck and strangled him The road I now had to travel was so little frequented that bushes of the ground oak and bilberry stood thick in almost every part of it Many of these bushes were full of dry leaves which had been touched by the frost but had not yet fallen It was easy for me to follow him for I pursued by the noise he made amongst these bushes but it was not so easy for me to avoid on my part the making of a rustling and agitation of the bushes which might expose me to detection I was now obliged to depend wholly on my ears to guide my pursuit my eyes being occupied in watching my own way to enable me to avoid every object the touching of which was likely to produce sound I followed this road more than a mile led by cracking of the sticks or the shaking of the leaves At length I heard a loud shrill whistle and then a total silence succeeded I now stood still and in a few seconds heard a noise in the swamp like the drumming of a pheasant Soon afterwards I heard the breaking of sticks and the sounds caused by the bending of branches of trees In a little time I was satisfied that something having life was moving in the swamp and coming towards the place where the mulatto stood This was at the end of the cart-road and opposite some large pine trees which grew in the swamp at the distance of two or three hundred yards from its margin The noise in the swamp still approached us and at length a person came out of the thicket and stood for a minute or more with the mulatto whom I had followed and then they both entered the swamp and took the course of the pine trees as I could easily distinguish by my ears When they were gone I advanced to the end of the road and sat down upon a log to listen to their progress through the swamp At length it seemed that they had stopped for I no longer heard any thing of them Anxious however to ascertain more of this mysterious business I remained in silence on the log determined to stay there until day if I could not sooner learn something to satisfy me why these men had gone into the swamp All uncertainty upon this subject was however quickly removed from my mind for within less than ten minutes after I had ceased to hear them moving in the thicket I was shocked by the faint but shrill wailings of a female voice accompanied with exclamations and supplications in a tone so feeble that I could only distinguish a few solitary words My mind comprehended the whole ground of this matter at a glance The lady supposed to have been murdered on Sunday evening was still living and concealed by the two fiends who had passed out of my sight but a few minutes before The one I knew for I had examined his features within a few feet of me in the full light of the moon and that the other was Hardy I was as perfectly convinced as if I had seen him also I now rose to return home the cries of the female in the swamp still continuing but growing weaker and dying away as I receded from the place where I had sat I was now in possession of the clearest evidence of the guilt of the two murderers but I was afraid to communicate my knowledge to my master lest he should suspect me of being an accomplice in this crime and if the lady could not be recovered alive I had no doubt that Hardy and his companion were sufficiently depraved to charge me as a participator with themselves to be avenged upon me I was confident that the mulatto David would return to the house before day and be found in his bed in the morning which he could easily do for he slept in a part of the stable loft under pretence of being near the horses of his mistress I thought it possible that Hardy might also return home that night and endeavour to account for his absence from home on Monday afternoon by some ingenious lie in the invention of which I knew him to be very expert In this case I saw that I should have to run the risk of being overpowered by the number of my false accusers and as I stood alone they might yet be able to sacrifice my life and escape the punishment due to their crimes After much consideration I came to the resolution of returning as quick as possible to the quarter-- calling up the overseer--and acquainting him with all that I had seen heard and done in the course of this night As I did not know what time of night it was when I left my bed I was apprehensive that day might break before I could so far mature my plans as to have persons to way-lay and arrest the mulatto on his return home but when I roused the overseer he told me it was only one o'clock and seemed but little inclined to credit my story but after talking to me several minutes he told me he now more than ever suspected me to be the murderer but he would go with me and see if I had told the truth When we arrived at the great house some members of the family had not yet gone to bed having been kept up by the arrival of several gentlemen who had been searching the woods all day for the lost lady and who had come here to seek lodgings when it was near midnight My master was in bed but was called up and listened attentively to my story--at the close of which he shook his head and with an oath You-- I believe you to be the murderer but we will go and see if all you say is a lie if it is the torments of--will be pleasure to what awaits you You have escaped once but you will not get off a second time I now found that somebody must die and if the guilty could not be found the innocent would have to atone for them The manner in which my master had delivered his words assured me that the life of somebody must be taken This new danger aroused my energies--and I told them I was ready to go and take the consequences Accordingly the overseer my young master and three other gentlemen immediately set out with me It was agreed that we should all travel on foot the overseer and I going a few paces in advance of the others We proceeded silently but rapidly on our way and as we passed it I shewed them the place where I sat under the holly bush the mulatto passed me We neither saw nor heard any person on the road and reached the log at the end of the cart-road where I sat when I heard the cries in the swamp All was now quiet and our party lay down in the bushes on each side of a large gum tree at the root of which the two murderers stood when they talked together before they entered the thicket We had not been here more than an hour when I heard as I lay with my head near the ground a noise in the swamp which I believed could only be made by those whom we sought I however nothing and the gentlemen did not hear it It was caused as I afterwards ascertained by dragging the fallen branch of a tree along the ground for the purpose of lighting the fire The night was very clear and serene--its silence only being broken at intervals by the loud hooting of the great long-eared owls which are numerous in these swamps I felt oppressed by the cold and was glad to hear the crowing of a cock at a great distance announcing the approach of day This was followed after a short interval by the cracking of sticks and by other tokens which I knew could proceed only from the motions of living bodies I now whispered to the overseer who lay near me that it would soon appear whether I had spoken the truth or not All were now satisfied that people were coming out of the swamp for we heard them speak to each other I desired the overseer to advise the other gentlemen to let the culprits come out of the swamp and gain the high ground before we attempted to seize them but this counsel was unfortunately not taken and when they came near to the gum-tree and it could be clearly seen that there were two men and no more one of the gentlemen called out to them to stop or they were dead Instead however of stopping they both sprang forward and took to flight They did not turn into the swamp for the gentleman who ordered them to stop was in their rear--they having already passed him At the moment they had started to run each of the gentlemen fired two pistols at them The pistols made the forest ring on all sides and I supposed it was impossible for either of the fugitives to escape from so many balls This was however not the case for only one of them was injured The mulatto David had one arm and one leg broken and fell about ten yards from us but Hardy escaped and when the smoke cleared away he was nowhere to be seen On being interrogated David acknowledged that the lady was in the swamp on a small island and was yet alive--that he and Hardy had gone from the house on Sunday for the purpose of waylaying and carrying her off and intended to kill her little brother--this part of the duty being assigned to him whilst Hardy was to drag the sister from her horse As they were both mulattos they blacked their faces with charcoal taken from a pine stump partially burned The boy was riding before his sister and when Hardy seized her and dragged her from her horse she screamed and frightened both the horses which took off at full speed by which means the boy escaped Finding that the boy was out of his reach David remained in the bushes until Hardy brought the sister to him They immediately tied a handkerchief round her face so as to cover her mouth and stifle her shrieks and taking her in their arms carried her back toward my master's house for some distance through the woods until they came to the cart-road leading along the swamp They then followed this road as far as it led and turning into the swamp took their victim to a place they had prepared for her the Sunday before on a small knoll in the swamp where the ground was dry Her hands were closely confined and she was tied by the feet to a tree He he had stolen some bread and taken it to her this night but when they unbound her mouth to permit her to eat she only wept and made a noise begging them to release her until they were obliged again to bandage her mouth It was now determined by the gentlemen that as the lady was still alive we ought not to lose a moment in endeavouring to rescue her from her dreadful situation I pointed out the large pine trees in the direction of which I heard the cries of the young lady and near which I believed she was--undertaking at the same time to act as pilot in penetrating the thicket Three of the gentlemen and myself accordingly set out leaving the other two with the wounded mulatto with directions to inform us when we deviated from a right line to the pine trees This they were able to do by attending to the noise we made with nearly as much accuracy as if they had seen us The atmosphere had now become a little cloudy and the morning was very dark even in the oak woods but when we had entered the thickets of the swamp all objects became utterly invisible and the obscurity was as total as if our eyes had been closed Our companions on the dry ground lost sight of the pine trees and could not give us any directions in our journey We became entangled in briers and vines and mats of bushes from which the greatest exertions were necessary to disengage ourselves It was so dark that we could not see the fallen trees and missing these fell into quagmires and sloughes of mud and water into which we sunk up to the arm-pits and from which we were able to extricate ourselves only be seizing upon the hanging branches of the surrounding trees After struggling in this half-drowned condition for at least a quarter of an hour we reached a small dry spot where the gentlemen again held a council as to ulterior measures They called to those left on the shore to know if we were proceeding toward the pine trees but received for answer that the pines were invisible and they knew not whether we were right or wrong In this state of uncertainty it was thought most prudent to wait the coming of day in our present resting place The air was frosty and in our wet clothes loaded as we were with mud it may be imagined that our feelings were not pleasant and when the day broke it brought us but little relief for we found as as it was light enough to enable us to see around that we were on one of those insulated dry spots called tussocks by the people of the south These tussocks are formed by clusters of small trees which taking root in the mud are in process of time surrounded by long grass which entwining its roots with those of the trees overspread and cover the surface of the muddy foundation by which the superstructure is supported These tussocks are often several yards in diameter That upon which we now were stood in the midst of a great miry pool into which we were again obliged to launch ourselves and struggle onward for a distance of ten yards before we reached the line of some fallen and decaying trees It was now broad daylight and we saw the pine trees at the distance of about a hundred yards from us but even with the assistance of the light we had great difficulty in reaching them--to do which we were compelled to travel at least a quarter of a mile by the angles and curves of the fallen timber upon which alone we could walk this part of the swamp being a vast half-fluid bog It was sunrise when we reached the pines which we found standing upon a small islet of firm ground containing as well as I could judge about half an acre covered with a heavy growth of white maples swamp oaks a few large pines and a vast mat of swamp laurel called in the south ivy I had no doubt that the object of our search was somewhere on this little island but small as it was it was no trifling affair to give every part of it a minute examination for the stems and branches of the ivy were so minutely interwoven with each other and spread along the ground in so many curves and crossings that it was impossible to proceed a single rod without lying down and creeping along the earth The gentlemen agreed that if any one discovered the young lady he should immediately call to the others and we all entered the thicket I however turned along the edge of the island with the intention of making its circuit for the purpose of tracing if possible the footsteps of those who had passed between it and the main shore I made my way more than half round the island without much difficulty and without discovering any signs of persons having been here before me but in crossing the trunk of a large tree which had fallen and the top of which extended far into the ivy I perceived some stains of mud on the bark of the log Looking into the swamp I saw that the root of this tree was connected with other fallen timber extending beyond the reach of my vision which was obstructed by the bramble of the swamp and the numerous ever-greens growing here I now advanced along the trunk of the tree until I reached its topmost branches and here discovered evident signs of a small trail leading into the thicket of ivy Creeping along and following this trail by the small bearberry bushes that had been trampled down and had not again risen to an erect position I was led almost across the island and found that the small bushes were discomposed quite up to the edge of a vast heap of the branches of ever-green trees produced by the falling of several large juniper cypress trees which grew in the swamp in a cluster and having been blown down had fallen with their tops athwart each other and upon the almost impervious mat of ivies with which the surface of the island was coated over I stood and looked at this mass of entangled green brush but could not perceive the slightest marks of any entrance into its labyrinths nor did it seem possible for any creature larger than a squirrel to penetrate it It now for the first time struck me as a great oversight in the gentlemen that they had not compelled the mulatto David to describe the place where they had concealed the lady and as the forest was so dense that no communication could be had with the shore either by words or signs we could not now procure any information on this subject I therefore called to the gentlemen who were on the island with me and desired them to come to me without delay Small as this island was it was after the lapse of many minutes that the overseer and the other gentlemen arrived where I stood and when they came they would have been the subjects of mirthful emotions had not the tragic circumstances in which I was placed banished from my heart every feeling but that of the most profound melancholy When the gentlemen had assembled I informed them of signs of footsteps that I had traced from the other side of the island and told them that I believed the young lady lay somewhere under the heap of brushwood before us This opinion obtained but little credit because there was no opening in the brush by which any one could enter it but on going a few paces round the heap I perceived a small shaggy pole resting on the brush and nearly concealed by it with the lower end stuck in the ground The branches had been cut from this pole at the distance of three or four inches from the main stem which made it a tolerable substitute for a ladder I immediately ascended the pole which led me to the top of the pile and here I discovered an opening in the brush between the forked top of one of the cypress trees through which a man might easily pass Applying my head to this aperture I distinctly heard a quick and laborious breathing like that of a person in extreme illness and again called the gentlemen to follow me When they came up the ladder the breathing was audible to all and one of the gentlemen whom I now perceived to be the stranger who was with us in my master's cellar when I was bled slid down into the dark and narrow passage without uttering a word I confess that some feelings of trepidation passed through my nerves when I stood alone but now that a leader had preceded me I followed and glided through the smooth and elastic cypress tops to the bottom of this vast labyrinth of green boughs When I reached the ground I found myself in contact with the gentleman who was in advance of me and near one end of a large concave oblong open space formed by the branches of the trees having been supported and kept above the ground partly by a cluster of very large and strong ivies that grew here and partly by a young gum tree which had been bent into the form of in arch by the falling timber Though we could not see into this leafy cavern from above yet when we had been in it a few moments we had light enough to see the objects around us with tolerable clearness but that which surprised us both greatly was that the place was totally silent and we could not perceive the appearance of any living thing except ourselves After we had been here some minutes our vision became still more distinct and I saw at the other end of the open space ashes of wood and some extinguished brands but there was no smoke Going to these ashes and stirring them with a stick I found coals of fire carefully covered over in a hole six or eight inches deep When he saw the fire the gentleman spoke to me and expressed his astonishment that we heard the breathing no longer but he had scarcely uttered these words when a faint groan as of a woman in great pain was heard to issue apparently from the ground but a motion of branches on our right assured me that the sufferer was concealed there The gentleman sprung to the spot pushed aside the pendant boughs stooped low beneath the bent ivies and came out bearing in his hands a delicate female figure As he turned round and exposed her half-closed eye and white forehead to the light he exclaimed Eternal God Maria is it you He then pressed her to his bosom and sunk upon the ground still holding her closely in his embrace The lady lay motionless in his arms and I thought she was dead Her hair hung matted and dishevelled from her head a handkerchief once white but now soiled with dust and stained with blood was bound firmly round her head covering her mouth and chin and was fastened at the back of the neck by a double knot and secured by a ligature of cypress bark I knew not whom most to pity--the lady who now lay insensible in the arms that still clasped her tenderly or the unhappy gentleman who having cut the cords from her limbs and the handkerchief from her face now sat and silently gazed upon her death-like countenance He uttered not a sigh and moved not a joint but his breast heaved with agony the sinews and muscles of his neck rose and fell like those of a man in convulsions all the lineaments of his face were alternately contracted and expanded as if his last moments were at hand whilst great drops of sweat rolled down his forehead as though he struggled against an enemy whose strength was more than human Oppressed by the sight of so much wretchedness I turned from its contemplation and called aloud to the gentlemen without who had all this time been waiting to hear from us to come up the ladder to the top of the pile of boughs The overseer was quickly at the top of the opening by which I had descended and I now informed him that we had found the lady He ordered me to hand her up--and I desired the gentleman who was with me to permit me to do so but this he refused--and mounting the boughs of the fallen trees and support himself by the strong branches of the ivies he quickly reached the place where the overseer stood He even here refused to part from his charge but bore her down the ladder alone He was however obliged to accept aid in conveying her through the swamp to the place where we had left the two gentlemen with the wounded mulatto whose sufferings demon as he was were sufficient to move the hardest heart His right arm and left leg were broken and he had lost much blood before we returned from the island and as he could not walk it was necessary to carry him home We had not brought any horses and until the lady was recovered no one seemed to think any more about the mulatto after he was shot down It was proposed to send for a horse to take David home but it was finally agreed that we should leave him in the woods where he was until a man could be sent for him with a cart At the time we left him his groans and lamentations seemed to excite no sympathy in the breast of any More cruel sufferings yet awaited him The lady was carried home in the arms of the gentlemen and she did not speak until after she was bathed and put to bed in my master's house as I afterwards heard I know she did not speak on the way She died on the fourth day after her rescue and before her death related the circumstances of her misfortune as I was told by a coloured woman who attended her in her illness in the following manner As she was riding in the dusk of the evening at a rapid trot a few yards behind her brother a black man sprang from behind a tree standing close by the side of the road seized her by her riding dress and dragged her to the ground but failed to catch the bridle of the horse which sprang off at full speed Another negro immediately came to the aid of the first and I could not catch him--we must make haste They carried her as fast as they could go to the place where we found her when they bound her hands feet and mouth and left her until the next night and had left her the second morning only a few minutes when she heard the report of guns Soon after this by great efforts she extricated one of her feet from the bark with which she was bound but finding herself too weak to stand she crawled as far as she could under the boughs of the trees hoping that when her assassins returned again they would not be able to find her and that she might there die alone Exhausted by the efforts she had made to remove herself she fell into the stupor of sleep from which she was aroused by the noise we made when we descended into the cavern She then supposing us to be her destroyers returned again lay still and breathed as softly as possible to prevent us from hearing her but when she heard the voice of the gentleman who was with me the tones of which were familiar to her she groaned and moved her feet to let us know where she was This exertion and the idea of her horrid condition overcame the strength of her nerves and when her deliverer raised her from the ground she had swooned and was unconscious of all things We had no sooner arrived at the house than inquiry was made for Hardy but it was ascertained in the kitchen that he had not been seen since the previous evening at night fall when he had left the kitchen for the purpose of going to sleep at the stable with David as he had told one of the black women and preparation was immediately made to go in pursuit of him For this purpose all the gentlemen present equipped themselves with pistols fowling pieces and horns--such as are used by fox hunters Messengers were despatched round the country to give notice to all the planters within the distance of many miles of the crime that had been committed and of the escape of one of its perpetrators with a request to them to come without delay and join in the pursuit intended to be given Those who had dogs trained to chase thieves were desired to bring them and a gentleman who lived twelve miles off and who owned a blood hound was sent for and requested to come with his dog in all haste In consequence I suppose of the information I had given I was permitted to be present at these deliberations and though my advice was not asked I was often interrogated concerning my knowledge of the affair Some proposed to go at once with dogs and horses into the woods and traverse the swamp and thickets for the purpose of rousing Hardy from the place of concealment he might have chosen but the opinion of the overseer prevailed who thought that from the intimate knowledge possessed by him of all the swamps and coverts in the neighbourhood there would be little hope of discovering him in this manner The overseer advised them to wait the coming of the gentleman with his blood hound before they entered the woods for the reason that if the blood hound could be made to take the trail he would certainly find his game before he quit it if not thrown off the scent by the men horses and dogs crossing his course but if the blood hound could not take the scent they might then adopt the proposed plan of pursuit with as much success as at present This counsel being adopted the horses were ordered into the stable and the gentlemen entered the house to take their breakfast and wait the arrival of the blood hound Nothing was of the mulatto David who seemed to be forgotten--not a word being spoken by any one of bringing him from the woods I knew that he was suffering the most agonizing pains and great as were his crimes his groans and cries of anguish still seemed to echo in my ears but I was afraid to make any application in his behalf lest even yet I might be suspected of some participation in his offences for I knew that the most horrid punishments were often inflicted upon slaves merely on suspicion As the morning advanced the number of men and horses in front of my master's mansion increased and before ten o'clock I think there were at least fifty of each--the horses standing hitched and the men conversing in groups without or as-together within the house At length the owner of the blood hound came bringing with him his dog in a chaise drawn by one horse The harness was removed from the horse its place supplied by a saddle and bridle and the whole party set off for the woods As they rode away my master who was one of the company told me to follow them but we had proceeded only a little distance when the gentlemen stopped and my master after speaking with the owner of the dog told the overseer to go back to the house and get some piece of the clothes of Hardy that had been worn by him lately The overseer returned and we all proceeded forward to the place where David lay We found him where we had left him greatly weakened by the loss of blood and complaining that the cold air caused his wounds to smart intolerably When I came near him he looked at me and told me I had betrayed him None of the gentlemen seemed at all moved by his sufferings and when any of them spoke to him it was with derision and every epithet of scorn and contumely As it was apparent that he could not escape no one proposed to remove him to a place of greater safety but several of the horsemen as they passed lashed him with the thongs of their whips but I do not believe he felt these blows--the pain he endured from his wounds being so great as to drown the sensation of such minor afflictions The day had already become warm although the night had been cold the sun shone with great clearness and many carrion crows attracted by the scent of blood were perched upon the trees near where we now were When the overseer came up with us he brought an old blanket in which Hardy had slept for some time and handed it to the owner of the dog who having first caused the hound to smell of the blanket untied the cord in which he had been led and turned him into the woods The dog went from us fifty or sixty yards in a right line then made a circle around us again commenced his circular movement and pursued it nearly half round Then he dropped his nose to the ground snuffed the tainted surface and moved off through the woods slowly almost touching the earth with his nose The owner of the dog and twelve or fifteen others followed him whilst the residue of the party dispersed themselves along the edge of the swamp and the overseer ordered me to stay and watch the horses of those who dismounted going himself on foot in the pursuit When the gentlemen were all gone out of sight I went to David who lay all this time within my view for the purpose of asking him if I could render him any assistance He begged me to bring him some water as he was dying of thirst no less than with the pain of his wounds One of the horsemen had left a large tin horn hanging on his saddle this I took and stopping the small end closely with leaves filled it with water from the swamp and gave it to the wounded man who drank it and then turning his head towards me --Hardy and I had laid plan to have this thing brought upon you and to have you hung for it--but you have escaped He then asked me if they intended to leave him to die in the woods or to take him home and hang him I told him I had heard them talk of taking him home in a cart but what was to be done with him I did not know I felt a horror of the crimes committed by this man was pained by the sight of his sufferings and being unable to relieve the one or to forgive the other went to a place where I could neither see nor hear him and sat down to await the return of those who had gone in pursuit of Hardy In the circumstances which surrounded me it cannot be supposed that my feelings were pleasant or that time moved very fleetly but painful as my situation was I was obliged to bear it for many hours From the time the gentlemen left me I neither saw nor heard them until late in the afternoon when five or six of them returned having lost their companions in the woods Toward sundown I heard a great noise of horns blown and of men shouting at a distance in the forest and soon after my master the owner of the blood hound and many others returned bringing with them Hardy whom the hound had followed ten or twelve miles through the swamps and thickets had at last caught him and would soon have killed him had he not been compelled to relinquish his prey When the party had all returned a kind of court was held in the woods where we then were for the purpose of determining what punishment should be inflicted upon Hardy and David All agreed at once that an example of the most terrific character ought to be made of such atrocious villains and that it would defeat the ends of Justice to deliver these fellows up to the civil authority to be hanged like common murderers The next measure was to settle upon the kind of punishment to be inflicted upon them and the manner of executing the sentence Hardy was all this time sitting on the ground covered with blood and yet bleeding profusely in hearing of his inexorable judges The dog had mangled both his arms and hands in a shocking manner torn a large piece of flesh entirely away from one side of his breast and sunk his fangs deep in the side of his neck No other human creature that I have ever seen presented a more deplorable spectacle of mingled crime and cruelty It was now growing late and the fate of these miserable men was to be decided before the company separated to go to their several homes One proposed to burn them another to flay them alive and a third to starve them to death and many other modes of slowly and tormentingly extinguishing life were named but that which was finally adopted was of all others the most horrible The wretches were unanimously sentenced to be stripped naked and bound down securely upon their backs on the naked earth in sight of each other to have their mouths closely covered with bandages to prevent them from making a noise to frighten away the birds and in this manner to be left to be devoured alive by the carrion crows and buzzards which swarm in every part of South Carolina The sentence was instantly carried into effect so far as its execution depended on us Hardy and his companion were divested of their clothes stretched upon their backs on the ground their mouths bandaged with handkerchiefs--their limbs extended-- and these together with their necks being crossed by numerous poles were kept close to the earth by forked sticks driven into the ground so as to prevent the possibility of moving any part of their persons and in this manner these wicked men were left to be torn in pieces by birds of prey The buzzards and carrion crows always attack dead bodies by pulling out and consuming the eyes first They then tear open the bowels and feed upon the intestines We returned to my master's plantation and I did not see this place again until the next Sunday when several of my fellow-slaves went with me to see the remains of the dead but we found only their bones Great flocks of buzzards and carrion crows were assembled in the trees giving a dismal aspect to the woods and I hastened to abandon a place fraught with so many afflicting recollections The lady who had been the innocent sacrifice of the brutality of the men whose bones I had seen bleaching in the sun had died on Saturday evening and her corpse was buried on Monday in a graveyard on my master's plantation I have never seen a large cotton plantation in Carolina without its burying ground This burying ground is not only the place of sepulture of the family who are the proprietors of the estate but also of many other persons who have lived in the neighbourhood Half an acre or an acre of ground is appropriated as a grave-yard on one side of which the proprietors of the estate from age to age are buried whilst the other parts of the ground are open to strangers poor people of their vicinity and in general to all who choose to inter their dead within its boundaries This custom prevails as far north as Maryland and it seems to me to be much more consonant to the feelings of solitude and tender recollections which we always associate with the memory of departed friends than the practice of promiscuous interment in a church-yard where all idea of seclusion is banished by the last home of the dead being thrown open to the rude intrusions of strangers where the sanctity of the sepulchre is treated as a common and where the grave itself is in a few years torn up or covered over to form a temporary resting place for some new tenant The family of the deceased lady though not very wealthy was amongst the most ancient and respectable in this part of the country and on Sunday whilst the body lay in my master's house there was a continual influx and efflux of visiters in carriages on horse-back and on foot The house was open to all who chose to come and the best wines cakes sweet-meats and fruits were handed about to the company by the servants though I observed that none remained for dinner except the relations of the deceased those of my master's family and the young gentleman who was with me on the island The visiters remained but a short time when they came and were nearly all in mourning This was the first time that I had seen a large number of the fashionable people of Carolina assembled together and their appearance impressed me with an opinion favourable to their character I had never seen an equal number of people anywhere whose deportment was more orderly and decorous nor whose feelings seemed to be more in accordance with the solemnity of the event which had brought them together I had been ordered by the overseer to remain at the great house until the afternoon for the purpose as I afterwards learned of being seen by those who came to see the corpse and many of the ladies and gentlemen inquired for me and when I was pointed out to them commended my conduct and fidelity in discovering the authors of the murder--condoled with me for having suffered innocently and several gave me money One old lady who came in a pretty carriage drawn by two black horses gave me a dollar On Monday the funeral took place and several hundred persons followed the corpse to the grave over which a minister delivered a short sermon The young gentleman who was with me when we found the deceased on the island walked with her Mother to the grave-yard and the little brother followed with a younger sister After the interment wines and refreshments were handed round to the whole assembly and at least a hundred persons remained for dinner with my master's family At four o'clock in the afternoon the carriages and horses were ordered to the door of the court-yard of the house and the company retired At sundown the plantation was as quiet as if its peace had never been disturbed XIV I have before observed that the negroes of the cotton plantations are exceedingly superstitious and they are indeed prone beyond all other people that I have ever known to believe in ghosts and the existence of an infinite number of supernatural agents No story of a miraculous character can be too absurd to obtain credit with them and a narrative is not the less eagerly listened to nor the more cautiously received because it is impossible in its circumstances Within a few weeks after the deaths of the two malefactors to whose horrible crimes were awarded equally horrible punishments the forest that had been the scene of these bloody deeds was reported and believed to be visited at night by beings of unearthly make whose groans and death-struggles were heard in the darkest recesses of the woods amidst the flapping of the wings of vultures the fluttering of carrion crows and the dismal croaking of ravens In the midst of this nocturnal din the noise caused by the tearing of the flesh from the bones was heard and the panting breath of the agonized sufferer quivering under the beaks of his tormentors as they consumed his vitals floated audibly upon the evening breeze The murdered lady was also seen walking by moonlight near the spot where she had been dragged from her horse wrapped in a blood-stained mantle overhung with gory and dishevelled locks The little island in the swamp was to present spactacles too horrible for human eyes to look upon and sounds were heard to issue from it which no human ear could bear Terrific and ghastly fires were seen to burst up at midnight amongst the ever-greens that clad this lonely spot emitting scents too suffocating and sickly to be endured whilst demoniac yells shouts of despair and groans of agony mingled their echos in the solitude of the woods Whilst I remained in this neighbourhood no coloured person ever travelled this road alone after night-fall and many white men would have ridden ten miles round the country to avoid the passage of the ridge road after dark Generations must pass away before the tradition of this place will be forgotten and many a year will open and close before the last face will be pale or the last heart beat as the twilight traveller skirts the borders of the Murderers' Swamp We had allowances of meat distributed to all the people twice this fall--once when we had finished the saving of the fodder and again soon after the murder of the young lady The first time we had beef such as I had driven from the woods went to the alligator pond but now we had two hogs given to us which weighed one a hundred and thirty and the other a hundred and fifty-six pounds This was very good pork and I received a pound and a quarter as my share of it This was the first pork that I had tasted in Carolina and it afforded a real feast We had in our family full seven pounds of good fat meat and as we now had plenty of sweet potatoes both in our gardens and in our weekly allowance we had on the Sunday following the funeral as good a dinner of stewed pork and potatoes as could have been found in all Carolina We did not eat all our meat on Sunday but kept part of it until Tuesday when we warmed it in a pot with an addition of parsley and other herbs and had another very comfortable meal I had by this time become in some measure acquainted with the country and began to lay and execute plans to procure supplies of such things as were not allowed me by my master I understood various methods of entrapping rackoons and other wild animals that abounded in the large swamps of this country and besides the skins which were worth something for their furs I generally procured as many rackoons opossums and rabbits as afforded us two or three meals in a week The woman with whom I lived understood the way of dressing an opossum and I was careful to provide one for our Sunday dinner every week so long as these animals continued fat and in good condition All the people on the plantation did not live as well as our family did for many of the men did not understand trapping game and others were too indolent to go far enough from home to find good places for setting their traps My principal trapping ground was three miles from home and I went three times a week always after night to bring home my game and keep my traps in good order Many of the families in the quarter caught no game and had no meat except that which we received from the overseer which averaged about six or seven meals in the year Lydia the woman whom I have mentioned heretofore was one of the women whose husbands procured little or nothing for the sustenance of their families and I often gave her a quarter of a rackoon or a small opossum for which she appeared very thankful Her health was not good--she had a bad cough and often told me she was feverish and restless at night It appeared clear to me that this woman's constitution was broken by hardships and sufferings and that she could not live long in her present mode of existence Her husband a native of a country far in the interior of Africa he had been a priest in his own nation and had never been taught to do any kind of labour being supported by the contributions of the public and he now maintained as far as he could the same kind of lazy dignity that he had enjoyed at home He was compelled by the overseer to work with the other hands in the field but as soon as he had come into his cabin he took his seat and refused to give his wife the least assistance in doing any thing She was consequently obliged to do the little work that it was necessary to perform in the cabin and also to bear all the labour of weeding and cultivating the family patch or garden The husband was a morose sullen man and he formerly had ten wives in his own country who all had to work for and wait upon him and he thought himself badly off here in having but one woman to do any thing for him This man was very irritable and often beat and otherwise maltreated his wife on the slightest provocation and the overseer refused to protect her on the ground that he never interfered in the family quarrels of the black people I pitied this woman greatly but as it was not in my power to remove her from the presence and authority of her husband I thought it prudent not to say nor do any thing to provoke him further against her As the winter approached and the autumnal rains set in she was frequently exposed in the field and was wet for several hours together this joined to the want of warm and comfortable woollen clothes caused her to contract colds and hoarseness which increased the severity of her cough A few days before Christmas her child died after an illness of only three days I assisted her and her husband to inter the infant--which was a little boy --and its father buried with it a small bow and several arrows a little bag of parched meal a miniature canoe about a foot long and a little paddle with which he it would cross the ocean to his own country a small stick with an iron nail sharpened and fastened into one end of it and a piece of white muslin with several curious and strange figures painted on it in blue and red by which he his relations and countrymen would know the infant to be his son and would receive it accordingly on its arrival amongst them Cruel as this man was to his wife I could not but respect the sentiments which inspired his affection for his child though it was the affection of a barbarian He cut a lock of hair from his head threw it upon the dead infant and closed the grave with his own hands He then told us the God of his country was looking at him and was pleased with what he had done Thus ended the funeral service As we returned home Lydia told me she was rejoiced that her child was dead and out of a world in which slavery and wretchedness must have been its only portion I am now she ready to follow my child and the sooner I go the better for me She went with us to the field until the month of January when as we were returning from our work one stormy and wet evening she told me she should never pick any more cotton--that her strength was gone and she could work no more When we assembled at the blowing of the horn on the following morning Lydia did not appear The overseer who had always appeared to dislike this woman when he missed her swore very angrily and he supposed she was pretending to be sick but if she was he would soon cure her He then stepped into his house and took some copperas front a little bag and mixed it with water I followed him to Lydia's cabin where he compelled her to drink this solution of copperas It caused her to vomit violently and made her exceedingly sick I think to this day that this act of the overseer was the most inhuman of all those that I have seen perpetrated upon defenceless slaves Lydia was removed that same day to the sick room in a state of extreme debility and exhaustion When she left this room again she was a corpse Her disease was a consumption of the lungs which terminated her life early in March I assisted in carrying her to the grave which I closed upon her and covered with green turf She sleeps by the side of her infant in a corner of the negro grave-yard of this plantation Death was to her a welcome messenger who came to remove her from toil that she could not support and from misery that she could not sustain Her life had been a morning of pleasure but a day of bitterness upon which no sunlight had fallen Had she known no other mode of existence than that which she saw on this plantation her lot would have been happiness itself in comparison with her actual destiny Trained up as she had been in Maryland no greater cruelty could have been devised by the malice of her most cunning enemy than to transfer her from the service and almost companionship of an indulgent and affectionate mistress to the condition in which I saw her and knew her in the cotton fields of South Carolina In Maryland it is a custom as widely extended as the state itself I believe to give the slaves a week of holidays at Christmas and the master who should attempt to violate this usage would become an object of derision amongst his neighbours But I learned long before Christmas that the force of custom was not so binding here as it is farther north In Maryland Christmas comes at a season of leisure when the work of the farm or the tobacco plantation is generally closed for the year and if a good supply of firewood has been provided there seems to be but little for the people to do and a week lost to the master is a matter of little moment at a period when the days are short and cold but in the cotton country the case is very different Christmas comes in the very midst of cotton picking The richest and best part of the crop has been secured before this period it is true but large quantities of cotton still remain in the field and every pound that can be saved from the winds or the plough of the next spring is a gain of its value to the owner of the estate For these reasons which are very powerful on the side of the master there is but little Christmas on a large cotton plantation In lieu of the week of holiday which formerly prevailed even in Carolina before cotton was cultivated as a crop the master now gives the people a dinner of meat on Christmas-day and distributes amongst them their annual allowance of winter clothes on estates where such an allowance is made and where it is not some small gratuity supplies its place There are cotton planters who give no clothes to their slaves but expect them to supply themselves with apparel out of the proceeds of their Sunday labour and nightly earnings Clothes of a certain quality were given to the people of the estate on which I lived at the time of which I now speak but they were not at all sufficient to keep us warm and comfortable in the winter and the residue we had to procure for ourselves In Georgia I lived three years with one master and the best master too that I ever had in the south who never gave me any clothes during that period except an old great coat and a pair of boots--I shall have occasion to speak of him hereafter As Christmas of the year approached we were all big with hope of obtaining three or four days at least if not a week of holiday but when the day at length arrived we were sorely disappointed for on Christmas eve when we had come from the field with our cotton the overseer fell into a furious passion and swore at us all for our laziness and many other bad qualities He then told us that he had intended to give us three days if we had worked well but that we had been so idle and had left so much cotton yet to be picked in the field that he found it impossible to give us more than one day but that he would go to the house and endeavour to procure a meat dinner for us and a dram in the morning Accordingly on the next morning we received a dram of peach brandy for each person and two hogs weighing together more than three hundred were slaughtered and divided amongst us I went to the field and picked cotton all day for which I was paid by the overseer and at night I had a good dinner of stewed pork and sweet potatoes--Such were the beginning and end of my first Christmas on a cotton plantation We went to work as usual the next morning and continued our labour through the week as if Christmas had been stricken from the calender I had already saved and laid by a little more than ten dollars in money but part of it had been given to me at the funeral I was now much in want of clothes none having been given me since I came here I had at the commencement of the cold weather cut up my old blanket and with the aid of Lydia who was a very good seamstress converted it into a pair of trousers and a long roundabout jacket but this deprived me of my bed which was imperfectly supplied by mats which I made of rushes The mats were very comfortable things to lie upon but they were by no means equal to blankets for covering A report had been current amongst us for some time that there would be a distribution of clothes to the people at new-year's-day but how much or what kind of clothes we were to get no one pretended to know except that we were to get shoes in conformity to a long-established rule of this plantation From Christmas to new-year appeared a long to week to me and I have no doubt that it longer to some of my fellow-slaves most of whom were entirely barefoot I had made mockasins for myself of the skins of squirrels that I had caught in my traps and by this means protected my feet from the frost which was sometimes very heavy and sharp in the morning On the first day of January when we met at the blowing of the morning horn the overseer told us we must all proceed to the great house where we were to receive our winter clothes and surely no order was ever more willingly obeyed When we arrived at the house our master was up and we were all called into the great court yard in front of the dwelling The overseer now told us that shoes would be given to all those who were able to go to the field to pick cotton This deprived of shoes the children and several old persons whose eye-sight was not sufficiently clear to enable them to pick cotton A new blanket was then given to every one above seven years of age--children under seven received no blanket being left to be provided for by their parents Children of this age and under go entirely naked in the day-time and sleep with their mothers at night or are wrapped up together such bedding as the mother may possess Children under seven years of age are of little use in picking cotton and it is not supposed that their labour can repay the expense of clothing them in a manner to fit them to go to the field--they are therefore suffered to remain in the house or quarter without clothes from October to April In summer they do not require clothes and can perform such work as they are able to do as well without garments as with them At the time we received our shoes and blankets there was not a good shirt in our quarter--but all the men and women had provided themselves with some sort of woollen clothes out of their own savings Woollen stuff for a petticoat and shortgown had also been given before Christmas to each of the women who were mothers of small children or in such a condition as to render it certain that they must in a short time become so Many of the women could pick as much cotton as a man and any good hand could earn sixty cents by picking cotton on Sunday--the overseer paying us punctually for all the cotton we brought in on Sunday evening Besides this a good hand could always in a fine day pick more cotton than was required to be brought home as a day's work I could not pick as much in a day as some of the others by four or five pounds but I could generally carry home as much beyond the day's work or task as it is called as entitled me to receive from five to ten cents every evening from the overseer This money was punctually paid to me every Saturday night and in some weeks I cleared in this way as high as fifty cents over and above what I earned on Sunday One of the men cleared to himself including his Sunday work two dollars a week for several weeks and his savings on this entire crop of cotton were thirty-one dollars--but he was a first-rate cotton picker and worked late and early One of the women cleared twenty-six dollars to herself in the same way We were expected to clothe ourselves with these and our other extra earnings but some of the people performed no more work through the week than their regular task and would not work constantly on Sunday Such were not able to provide themselves with good clothes and many of them suffered greatly from the cold in the course of the winter When the weather was mild and pleasant some of the children who were not required to go to the field to do a day's work would go out in the warmest part of the day and pick a few pounds of cotton for which their parents received pay and were obliged in return to find the children in bedding for the winter A man can plant and cultivate more cotton plants than he is afterwards able to pick the wool from if the season is good and no disaster befalls the crop Here every effort is made from the commencement of the picking season until its close to procure as much work as possible from the hands and spite of all that can be done much cotton is lost--the people not being able to pick it all from the stalks before the field is ploughed up to prepare the ground for the reception of the seeds of a new crop In such cases every pound that the hands can be induced to pick beyond their daily task is a clear gain to the master and slaves often leave the fields of their masters where the cotton is nearly all gathered and the picking is poor to go to the field of some neighbouring planter where the cotton is more abundant to work on Sunday It is a matter of indifference to the slave whether his master gets his cotton all picked or not his object is to get employment in a field where he can make the best wages In such cases the masters often direct the overseers to offer their own slaves one half as much as the cotton is worth for each pound they will pick on Sunday--and this for the purpose of preventing them from going to some other field to work on that day The usual price only is paid for extra cotton picked on working days for after a hand has picked his task he would not have time to go anywhere else to work nor indeed would he be permitted to leave his plantation The slave is a kind of freeman on Sunday all over the southern country and it is in truth by the exercise of his liberty on this day that he is enabled to provide himself and his family with many of the necessaries of life that his master refuses to supply him with It is altogether impossible to make a person residing in any of the middle or northern states of the Union and who has never been in the south throughly acquainted with all the minute particulars of the life of a slave on a cotton plantation or to give him an idea of the system of parsimonious economy that the slave is obliged to exercise and maintain in his little household Poor as the slave is and dependant at all times upon the arbitrary will of his master or yet more fickle caprice of the overseer his children look up to him in his little cabin as their protector and supporter There is always in every cabin except in times of scarcity after there has been a failure of the corn crop a sufficient supply of either corn bread or sweet potatoes and either of these is sufficient to give health and vigour to children who are not required to do any work but a person who is grown up and is obliged to labour hard finds either bread or potatoes or even both together quite inadequate to sustain the body in the full and powerful tone of muscular action that more generous food would bestow A mother will imagine the painful feelings experienced by a parent in the cabin of a slave when a small portion of animal food is procured dressed and made ready for the table The father and mother know that it is not only food but medicine to them and their appetites keenly court the precious morsel whilst the children whose senses are all acute seem to be indued with taste and smell in a tenfold degree and manifest a ravenous craving for fresh meat which it is painful to witness without being able to gratify it During the whole of this fall and winter we usually had something to roast at least twice a week in our cabin These roasts were rackoons opossums and other game--the proceeds of my trapping All the time the meat was hanging at the fire as well as while it was on the table our house was surrounded by the children of our fellow-slaves some begging for a piece and all expressing by their eager countenances the keen desire they felt to partake with us of our dainties It was idle to think of sharing with them the contents of our board for they were often thirty or forty in number and the largest rackoon would scarcely have made a mouthful for each of them There was one little boy four years old a very fine little fellow to whom I had become warmly attached and who used to share with me in all the good things I possessed He was of the same age with my own little son whom I had left in Maryland and there was nothing that I possessed in the world that I would not have divided with him even to my last crust It may well be supposed that in our society although we were all slaves and all nominally in a condition of the most perfect equality yet there was in fact a very great difference in the manner of living in the several families Indeed I doubt if there is as great a diversity in the modes of life in the several families of any white village in New-York or Pennsylvania containing a population of three hundred persons as there was in the several households of our quarter This may be illustrated by the following circumstance Before I came to reside in the family with whom I lived at this time they seldom tasted animal food or even fish except on meat-days as they were called that is when meat was given to the people by the overseer under the orders of our master The head of the family was a very quiet worthy man but slothful and inactive in his habits When he had come from the field at night he seldom thought of leaving the cabin again before morning He would and did make baskets and mats and earned some money by these means he also did his regular day's work on Sunday but all his acquirements were not sufficient to enable him to provide any kind of meat for his family All that his wife and children could do was to provide him with work at his baskets and mats and they lived even then better than some of their neighbours After I came among them and had acquired some knowledge of the surrounding country I made as many baskets and mats as he did and took time to go twice a week to look at all my traps As the winter passed away and spring approached the proceeds of my hunting began to diminish The game became scarce and both rackoons and opossums grew poor and worthless It was necessary for me to discover some new mode of improving allowance allotted to me by the overseer I had all my life been accustomed to fishing in Maryland and I now resolved to resort to the water for a living the land having failed to furnish me a comfortable subsistence With these views I set out one Sunday morning early in February and went to the river at a distance of three miles from home From the appearance of the stream I felt confident that it must contain many fish and I went immediately to work to make a weir With the help of an axe that I had with me I had finished before night the frame work of a weir of pine sticks lashed together with white oak splits I had no canoe but made a raft of dry logs upon which I went to a suitable place in the river and set my weir I afterwards made a small net of twine that I bought at the store and on next Thursday night I took as many fish from my weir as filled a half bushel measure This was a real treasure--it was the most fortunate circumstance that had happened with me since I came to the country I was enabled to show my generosity but like all mankind even in my liberality I kept myself in mind I gave a large fish to the overseer and took three more to the great house These were the first fresh fish that had been in the family this season and I was much praised by my master and young mistresses for my skill and success in fishing but this was all the advantage I received from this effort to court the favour of the great--I did not even get a dram The part I had performed in the detection of the murderers of the young lady was forgotten or at least not mentioned now I went away from the house not only disappointed but chagrined and thought with myself that if my master and young mistresses had nothing but words to give me for my fish we should not carry on a very large traffic On next Sunday morning a black boy came from the house and told me that our master wished to see me This summons was not to be disobeyed When I returned to the mansion I went round to the kitchen and sent word by one of the house-slaves that I had come The servant returned and told me that I was to stay in the kitchen and get my breakfast and after that to come into the house A very good breakfast was sent to me from my master's table after the family had finished their morning meal and when I had done with my repast I went into the parlour I was received with great affability by my master who told me he had sent for me to know if I had been accustomed to fish in the place I had come from I informed him that I had been employed at a fishery on the Patuxent every spring for several years and that I thought I understood fishing with a seine as well as most people He then asked me if I could knit a seine to which I replied in the affirmative After some other questions he told me that as the picking of cotton was nearly over for this season and the fields must soon be ploughed up for a new crop he had a thought of having a seine made and of placing me at the head of a fishing party for the purpose of trying to take a supply of fish for his hands No communication could have been more unexpected than this was and it was almost as pleasing to me as it was unexpected by me I now began to hope that there would be some respite from the labours of the cotton field and that I should not be doomed to drag out a dull and monotonous existence within the confines of the enclosures of the plantation In Maryland the fishing season was always one of hard labour it is true but also a time of joy and hilarity We then had throughout the time of fishing plenty of bread and at least bacon enough to fry our fish with We had also a daily allowance of whiskey or brandy and we always considered ourselves fortunate when we left the farm to go to the fishery A few days after this I was again sent for by my master who told me that he had bought twine and ropes for a seine and that I must set to work and knit it as quickly as possible that as he did not wish the twine to be taken to the quarter I must remain with the servants in the kitchen and live with them whilst employed in constructing the seine I was assisted in making the seine by a black boy whom I had taught to work with me and by the end of two weeks we had finished our job While at work on this seine I lived rather better than I had formerly done when residing at the quarter We received amongst us--twelve in number including the people who worked in the garden-- the refuse of our master's table In this way we procured a little cold meat every day and when there were many strangers visiting the family we sometimes procured considerable quantities of cold and broken meats My new employment afforded me a better opportunity than I had hitherto possessed of making correct observations upon the domestic economy of my master's household and of learning the habits and modes of life of the persons who composed it On a great cotton plantation such as this of my master's the field hands who live in the quarter are removed so far from the domestic circle of their master's family by their servile condition and the nature of their employment that they know but little more of the transactions within the walls of the great house than if they lived ten miles off Many a slave has been born lived to old age and died on a plantation without ever having been within the walls of his master's domicil My master was a widower and his house was in charge of his sister a maiden lady apparently of fifty- five or sixty He had six children three sons and three daughters and all unmarried but only one of the sons was at home at the time I came upon the estate the other two were in some of the northern cities the one studying medicine and the other at college At the time of knitting the twine these young gentlemen had returned on a visit to their relations and all the brothers and sisters were now on the place The young ladies were all grown up and marriageable their father was known to be a man of great wealth and the girls were reputed very pretty in Carolina one of them the second of the three was esteemed a great beauty The reader might deem my young mistress' pretty face and graceful person altogether impertinent to the narrative of my own life but they had a most material influence upon my fortunes and changed the whole tenor of my existence Had she been less beautiful or of a temper less romantic and adventurous I should still have been a slave in South Carolina if yet alive and the world would have been saved the labour of perusing these s Any one at all acquainted with southern manners will at once see that my master's house possessed attractions which would not fail to draw within it numerous visiters and that the head of such a family as dwelt under its roof was not likely to be without friends I had not been at work upon the seine a week before I discovered by listening to the conversation of my master and the other members of the family that they prided themselves not a little upon the antiquity of their house and the long practice of a generous hospitality to strangers and to all respectable people who chose to visit their homestead All circumstances seemed to conspire to render this house one of the chief seats of the fashion the beauty the wit and the gallantry of South Carolina Scarcely an evening came but it brought a carriage and ladies and gentlemen and their servants and every day brought dashing young planters mounted on horseback to dine with the family but Sunday was the day of the week on which the house received the greatest accession of company My master and family were members of the Episcopal Church and attended service every Sunday when the weather was fine at a church eight miles distant Each of my young masters and mistresses had a saddlehorse and in pleasant weather they frequently all went to church on horseback leaving my old master and mistress to occupy the family carriage alone I have seen fifteen or twenty young people come to my master's for dinner on Sunday from church and very often the parson a young man of handsome appearance was amongst them I had observed these things long before but now I had come to live at the house and became more familiar with them Three Sundays intervened while I was at work upon the seine and on each of these Sundays more than twenty persons besides the family dined at my master's During these three weeks my young masters were absent far the greater part of the time but I observed that they generally came home on Sunday for dinner My young mistresses were not from home much and I believe they never left the plantation unless either their father or some one of their brothers was with them Dinner parties were frequent in my master's house and on these occasions of festivity a black man who belonged to a neighbouring estate and who played the violin was sent for I observed that whenever this man was sent for he came and sometimes even came before night which appeared a little singular to me as I knew the difficulty that coloured people had to encounter in leaving the estate to which they were attached I felt curious to ascertain how it happened that Peter that was the name of the fiddler enjoyed such privileges and contrived to become acquainted with him when he came to get his supper in the kitchen He informed me that his master was always ready to let him go to a ball and would permit him to leave the cotton field at any time for that purpose and even lend him a horse to ride I afterwards learned from this man that his master compelled him to give him half the money that he received as gratuities from the gentlemen for whom he played at the dinner parties but as his master had enjoined him under pain of being whipped not to divulge this circumstance I never betrayed the poor fellow's confidence Peter's master was a planter who owned thirty slaves and his children several of whom were young ladies and gentlemen moved in highly respectable circles of society but I believe my master's family did not treat them as quite their equals not so much on account of their inferiority in point of wealth as because they were new in the country having only been settled here but a few years and the master of Peter having when a young man acted as overseer on a rice plantation near Charleston XV I have though always in a very humble station in life travelled more and seen more of the people in the United States than some who occupy elevated ranks and claim for themselves a knowledge of the world far greater than I pretend to possess but a man's knowledge is to be valued not by that which he has imagined but by that which experience has taught him and in estimating his ability to give information to others we are to judge him not by what he says he would wish men and the world to be but by what he has seen and by the just inferences he draws from those actions that he has witnessed in the various conditions of human society that have passed in review before him In this book I do not pretend to discuss systems or advance theories I am content to give facts as I saw them In the northern and middle states so far as I have known them very little respect is paid to family pretensions and this disregard of ancestry seems to me to be the necessary offspring of the condition of things In the states of New-York and Pennsylvania there are so many ways by which men may and do arrive at distinction and so many and such various means of acquiring wealth that all claim of superiority on account of the possession of any particular kind of property is prohibited by public opinion A great landholder is counterbalanced by a great manufacturer and perhaps surpassed by a great merchant whilst a successful and skilful mechanic is the rival of all these Family distinction can obtain no place amongst these men In the plantation states the case is widely different There lands and slaves constitute the only property of the country that is worthy of being taken into an estimate of public wealth Cattle and horses hogs sheep and mules exist but in numbers so few and of qualities so inferior that the portion of them possessed by any individual planter would compose an aggregate value of sufficient magnitude only to raise him barely beyond the lines that divide poverty from mediocrity of condition The mechanic is a sort of journeyman to the planters and works about the country as he may chance to find a job in building a house erecting a cotton-gin or constructing a horse-mill if he is a carpenter or mill-wright if he is a tailor he seeks employment from house to house never remaining longer in one place than to allow himself time to do the work of the family The mechanic holds a kind of half-way rank between the gentleman and the slave He is not and never can be a gentleman for the reason that he does and must do his own work Hence mechanics and artizans of every description avoid the southern country or if found there they are only sojourners The country they are in is not their home they are there from necessity or with a hope of acquiring money to establish themselves in business in places where their occupations are held more in honour Manufacturers are not in existence in the cotton country therefore no comparison can be instituted between them and the planters I believe from what I saw that all the commerce of the cotton country is in the hands of strangers and that a large portion of these strangers are foreigners The planters deal with them from necessity as they must have such things as they need and must obtain them somewhere and from somebody The store-keeper lives as well dresses as well and often lives in as good a house as the planter--perhaps in one that is better than that of the planter but his wealth is not so material his means of subsistence do not strike the eye so powerfully as a hundred field hands and three hundred acres of cotton The country has no hold on him and he has no hold on the country His habits of life are not similar to those of his neighbours--he is not one of us All the families who visited at my master's were those of planters and the families of the cotton planters have nothing to do but visit or read hunt or fish or run into some vicious amusements or sit down and do nothing Every kind of labour is as strictly prohibited to the sons and daughters of the planters by universal custom as if a law of the land made it punishable by fine and imprisonment and gave one-half of the fine to a common informer The only line that divides the gentleman from the simple man is that the latter works for his living whilst the former has slaves to work for him No man who works with his hands can or will be received into the highest orders of society on a footing of equality nor can he hope to see his family treated better than himself This unhappy fiat of public opinion has done infinite mischief in the south Men of fortune will not work nor permit their sons to work in the field because this exemption from labour is their badge of gentility and the circumstance that distinguishes them from the less favoured members of the community As the wealthy the great and the fashionable are never seen at labour and as it is known that they hold it to be beneath the rank of a gentleman to work in the field those who are more sparingly endowed with the advantages of fortune imbibe an opinion that it is disgraceful to plough or to dig and that it is necessary to lead a life of idleness to maintain their caste in society No man works in South Carolina except under the impulse of necessity In this state of things many men of limited fortunes rear up families of children without education and without the means of supporting an expensive style of living The sons when grown up of necessity commingle with the other young people of the country and bring with them into the affairs of the world nothing upon which they can pride themselves except that they are white men and are not obliged to work for a living This false pride has infected the whole mass of the white population and the young man whose father has half a dozen children and an equal number of slaves looks with affected disdain upon the son of his father's neighbour who owns no slaves because the son of the non-slaveholder must work for his bread whilst the son of the master of half a dozen negroes contrives to support himself in a sort of lazy poverty only one remove from actual penury Every man who is able to procure a subsistence without labour regards himself a gentleman from this circumstance alone if he has nothing else to sustain his pretensions These poor gentlemen are the worst members of society and the least productive of benefit either to themselves or their country They are prone to horse-racing cock-fighting gambling and all sorts of vices common to the country Having no livelihood and being engaged in no pursuit they hope to distinguish themselves by running to excess in what they call fashionable amusements or sporting exercises These people are universally detested by the slaves and are indeed far more tyrannical than the great slave-holders themselves or any other portion of the white population the overseers excepted A man who is master of only four or five slaves is generally the most ready of all to apprehend a black man whom he may happen to catch straying from his plantation and generally whips him the most unmercifully for this offence The law gives him the same authority to arrest the person of a slave seen travelling without his pass that it vests in the owner of five hundred negroes and the experience of all ages that petty tyrants are the most oppressive seems fully verified in the cotton country A person who has not been in the slave-holding states can never fully understand the bonds that hold society together there or appreciate the rules which prescribe the boundaries of the pretensions of the several orders of men who compose the body politic of those communities and after all that I have written and all that I shall write in this book the reader who has never resided south of the Potomac will never be able to perceive things precisely as they present themselves to my vision or to comprehend the spirit that prevails in a country where the population is divided into three separate classes Those will fall into great error who shall imagine that in Carolina and Georgia there are but two orders of men and that the artificial distinctions of society have only classified the people into white and black freemen and slaves It is true that the distinctions of colour are the most obvious and present themselves more readily than any others to the inspection of a stranger but he who will take time to examine into the fundamental organization of society in the cotton planting region will easily discover that there is a third order of men located there little known to the world but who nevertheless hold a separate station occupying a place of their own and who do not come into direct contrast with either the master or the slave The white man who has no property no possession and no education is in Carolina in a condition no better than that to which the slave has been reduced except only that he is master of his own person and of his own time and may if he chooses emigrate and transfer himself to a country where he can better his circumstances whilst the slave is bound by invisible chains to the plantation on which his master may think proper to place him In my opinion there is no order of men in any part of the United States with which I have any acquaintance who are in a more debased and humiliated state of moral servitude than are those white people who inhabit that part of the southern country where the landed property is all or nearly all held by the great planters Many of these white people live in wretched cabins not half so good as the houses which judicious planters provide for their slaves Some of these cabins of the white men are made of mere sticks or small poles notched or rather thatched together and filled in with mud mixed with the leaves or shats as they are termed of the pine tree Some fix their residence far in the pine forest and gain a scanty subsistence by notching the trees and gathering the turpentine others are seated upon some poor and worthless point of land near the margin of a river or creek and draw a precarious livelihood from the water and the badly cultivated garden that surrounds or adjoins the dwelling These people do not occupy the place held in the north by the respectable and useful class of day labourers who constitute so considerable a portion of the numerical population of the country In the south these white cottagers are never employed to work on the plantations for wages Two things forbid this The white man however poor and necessitous he may be is too proud to go to work in the same field with the negro slaves by his side and the owner of the slaves is not willing to permit white men of the lowest order to come amongst them lest the morals of the negroes should be corrupted and illicit traffic should be carried on to the detriment of the master The slaves generally believe that however miserable they may be in their servile station it is nevertheless preferable to the degraded existence of these poor white people This sentiment is cherished by the slaves and encouraged by their masters who fancy that they subserve their own interests in promoting an opinion amongst the negroes that they are better off in the world than are many white persons who are free and have to submit to the burthen of taking care of and providing for themselves I never could learn nor understand how or by what means these poor cottagers came to be settled in Carolina They are a separate and distinct race of men from the planters and appear to have nothing in common with them If it were possible for any people to occupy a grade in human society below that of the slaves on the cotton plantations certainly the station would be filled by these white families who cannot be to possess any thing in the shape of property The contempt in which they are held and the contumely with which they are treated by the great planters to be comprehended must be seen These observations are applicable in their fullest extent only to the lower parts of Georgia and Carolina and to country places In the upper country where slaves are not so numerous and where less of cotton and more of grain is cultivated there is not so great a difference between the white man who holds slaves and a plantation and another white man who has neither slaves nor plantation In the towns also more especially in Charleston and Savannah where the number of white men who have no slaves is very great they are able from their very numbers to constitute a moral force sufficiently powerful to give them some degree of weight in the community I shall now return to my narrative Early in March or perhaps on one of the last days of February my seine being now completed my master told me I must take with me three other black men and go to the river to clear out a fishery This task of clearing out a fishery was a very disagreeable job for it was nothing less than dragging out of the river all the old trees and brush that had sunk to the bottom within the limits of our intended fishing ground My master's eldest son had been down the river and had purchased two boats to be used at the fishery but when I saw them I declared them to be totally unfit for the purpose They were old batteaux and so leaky that they would not have supported the weight of a wet seine and the men necessary to lay it out I advised the building of two good canoes from some of the large yellow pines in the woods My advice was accepted and together with five other hands I went to work at the canoes which we completed in less than a week So far things went pretty well and I flattered myself that I should become the head man at this new fishery and have the command of the other hands I also expected that I should be able to gain some advantage to myself by disposing of a part of the small fish that might be taken at the fishery I reckoned without my host My master had only purchased this place a short time before he bought me Before that time he did not own any place on the river fit for the establishment of a fishery His lands adjoined the river for more than a mile in extent along its margin but an impassable morass separated the channel of the river from the firm ground all along his lines He had cleared the highest parts of this morass or swamp and had here made his rice fields but he was as entirely cut off from the river as if an ocean had separated it from him On the day that we launched the canoes into the river and while we were engaged in removing some snags and old trees that had stuck in the mud near the shore an ill-looking stranger came to us and told us that our master had sent him to take charge of the fishery and superintend all the work that was to be done at it This man by his contract with my master was to receive a part of all the fish caught in lieu of wages and was invested with the same authority over us that was exercised by the overseer in the cotton field I soon found that I had cause to regret my removal from the plantation It was found quite impossible to remove the old logs and other rubbish from the bottom of the river without going into the water and wrenching them from their places with long hand-spikes In performing this work we were obliged to wade up to our shoulders and often to dip our very heads under water in raising the sunken timber However within less than a week we had cleared the ground and now began to haul our seine At first we caught nothing but common river fish but after two or three days we began to take shad Of the common fish such as pike perch suckers and others we had the liberty of keeping as many as we could eat but the misfortune was that we had no pork or fat of any kind to fry them with and for several days we contented ourselves with broiling them on the coals and eating them with our corn bread and sweet potatoes We could have lived well if we had been permitted to broil the shad on the coals and eat them for a fat shad will dress itself in being broiled and is very good without any oily substance added to it All the shad that we caught were carefully taken away by a black man who came three times every day to the fishery with a cart The master of the fishery had a family that lived several miles up the river In the summer time he fished with hooks and small nets when not engaged in running turpentine in the pine woods In the winter he went back into the pine forest and made tar of the dead pine trees but returned to the river at the opening of the spring to take advantage of the shad fishery He was supposed to be one of the most skilful fishermen on the Congaree river and my master employed him to superintend his new fishery under an expectation I presume that as he was to get a tenth part of all the fish that might be caught he would make the most of his situation My master had not calculated with accuracy the force of habit nor the difficulty which men experience in conducting very simple affairs of which they have no practical knowledge The fish-master did very well for the interest of his employer for a few days compelling us to work in hauling the seine night and day and scarcely permitting us to take rest enough to obtain necessary sleep We were compelled to work full sixteen hours every day including Sunday for in the fishing season no respect is paid to Sunday by fishermen anywhere We had our usual quantity of bread and potatoes with plenty of common fish but no shad came to our lot nor had we any thing to fry our fish with A broiled fresh-water fish is not very good at best without salt or oil and after we had eaten them every day for a week we cared very little for them By this time our fish-master began to relax in his discipline not that he became more kind to us or required us to do less work but to compel us to work all night it was necessary for him to sit up all night and watch us This was a degree of toil and privation to which he could not long submit and one evening soon after dark he called me to him and told me that he intended to make me overseer of the fishery that night and he had no doubt I would keep the hands at work and attend to the business as well without him as with him He then went into his cabin and went to bed whilst I went and laid out the seine and made a very good haul We took more than two hundred shad at this draught and followed up our work with great industry all night only taking time to eat our accustomed meal at midnight Every fisherman knows that the night is the best time for taking shad and the little rest that had been allowed us since we began to fish had always been from eight o'clock in the morning until four in the afternoon unless within that period there was an appearance of a school of fish in the river when we had to rise and lay out the seine no matter at what hour of the day The fish-master had been very severe with the hands since he came amongst us and had made very free use of a long hickory gad that he sometimes carried about with him though at times he would relax his austerity and talk quite familiarly with us especially with me whom he perceived to have some knowledge of the business in which we were engaged The truth was that this man knew nothing of fishing with a seine and I had been obliged from the beginning to direct the operations of laying out and drawing in the seine though the master was always very loud and boisterous in giving his commands and directing us in what part of the river we should let down the seine Having never been accustomed to regular work or to the pursuit of any constant course of personal application the master was incapable of long continued exertion and I feel certain that he could not have been prevailed upon to labour twelve hours each day for a year if in return he had been certain of receiving ten thousand dollars Notwithstanding this he was capable of rousing himself and of undergoing any degree of fatigue or privation for a short time even for a few days He had not been trained to habits of industry and could not bear the restraints of uniform labour We worked hard all night the first night of my superintendence and when the sun rose the next morning the master had not risen from his bed As it was now the usual time of dividing the fish I called to him to come and see this business fairly done but as he did not come down immediately to the landing I proceeded to make the division myself in as equitable a manner as I could giving however a full share of large fish to the master When he came down to us and overlooked both the piles of fish-- his own and that of my master--he was so well satisfied with what I had done that he if he had known that I would do so well for him he would not have risen I was glad to hear this as it led me to hope that I should be able to induce him to stay in his cabin during the greater part of the time to do which I was well assured he felt disposed When the night came the master again told me he should go to bed not being well and desired me to do as I had done the night before This night we cooked as many shad as we could all eat but were careful to carry far out into the river the scale and entrails of the stolen fish In the morning I made a division of the fish before I called the master and then went and asked him to come and see what I had done He was again well pleased and now proposed to us all that if we would not let the affair be known to our master he would leave us to manage the fishery at night according to our discretion To this proposal we all readily agreed and I received authority to keep the other hands at work until the master would go and get his breakfast I had now accomplished the object that I had held very near my heart ever since we began to fish at this place From this time to the end of the fishing season we all lived well and did not perform more work than we were able to bear I was in no fear of being punished by the fish-master for he was now a least as much in my power as I was in his for if my master had known the agreement that he had made with us for the purpose of enabling himself to sleep all night in his cabin he would have been deprived of his situation and all the profits of his share of the fishery There never can be any affinity of feeling between master and slave except in some few isolated cases where the master has treated his slave in such a manner as to have excited in him strong feelings of gratitude or where the slave entertains apprehensions that by the death of his master or by being separated from him in any other way he may fall under the power of a more tyrannical ruler or may in some shape be worsted by the change I was never acquainted with a slave who believed that he violated any rule of morality by appropriating to himself any thing that belonged to his master if it was necessary to his comfort The master might call it theft and brand it with the name of crime but the slave reasoned differently when he took a portion of his master's goods to satisfy his hunger keep himself warm or to gratify his passion for luxurious enjoyment The slave sees his master residing in a spacious mansion riding in a fine carriage and dressed in costly clothes and attributes the possession of all these enjoyments to his own labour whilst he who is the cause of so much gratification and pleasure to another is himself deprived of even the necessary accommodations of human life Ignorant men do not and cannot reason logically and in tracing things from cause to effect the slave attributes all that he sees in possession of his master to his own toil without taking the trouble to examine how far the skill judgment and economy of his master may have contributed to the accumulation of the wealth by which his residence is surrounded There is in fact a mutual dependence between the master and his slave The former could not acquire any thing without the labour of the latter and the latter would always remain in poverty without the former in directing labour to a definite and profitable result After I had obtained the virtual command of the fishery I was careful to awaken the master every morning at sunrise that he might be present when the division of the fish was made and when the morning cart arrived that the carter might not report to my master that the fish-master was in bed I had now become interested in preserving the good opinion of my master in favour of his agent Since my arrival in Carolina I had never enjoyed a full meal of bacon and now determined if possible to procure such a supply of that luxury as would enable me and all my fellow-slaves at the fishery to regale ourselves at pleasure At this season of the year boats frequently passed up the river laden with merchandise and goods of various kinds amongst which were generally large quantities of salt intended for curing fish and for other purposes on the plantations These boats also carried bacon and salted pork up the river for sale but they never moved at night confining their navigation to daylight and as none of them had hitherto stopped near our landing we had not met with an opportunity of entering into a traffic with any of the boat masters We were not always to be so unfortunate One evening in the second week of the fishing season a large keel-boat was seen working up the river about sundown and shortly after came to for the night on the opposite side of the river directly against our landing We had at the fishery a small canoe called a punt about twelve feet long and when we went to lay out the seine for the first haul after night I attached the punt to the side of the canoe and when we had finished letting down the seine I left the other hands to work it toward the shore and ran over in the punt to the keel-boat Upon inquiring of the captain if he had any bacon that he would exchange for shad he he had a little but as the risk he would run in dealing with a slave was great I must expect to pay him more than the usual price He at length proposed to give me a hundred pounds of bacon for three hundred shad This was at least twice as much as the bacon was worth but we did not bargain as men generally do where half of the bargain is on each side for here the captain of the keel-boat settled the terms for both parties However he ran the hazard of being prosecuted for dealing with slaves which is a very high offence in Carolina and I was selling that which in point of law did not belong to me but to which nevertheless I felt in my conscience that I had a better right than any other person In support of the right which I felt to be on my side in this case came a keen appetite for the bacon which settled the controversy upon the question of the morality of this traffic in my favour It so happened that we made a good haul with our seine this evening and at the time I returned to the landing the men were all on shore engaged in drawing in the seine As soon as we had taken out the fish we placed three hundred of them in one of our canoes and pushed over to the keel-boat where the fish were counted out and the bacon was received into our craft with all possible despatch One part of this small trade exhibited a trait of human character which I think worthy of being noticed The captain of the boat was a middle-aged thin sallow man with long bushy hair and he looked like one who valued the opinions of men but little I expected that he would not be scrupulous in giving me my full hundred pound of bacon but in this I was mistaken for he weighed the flitches with great exactness in a pair of large steelyards and gave me good weight When the business was ended and the bacon in my canoe he told me he hoped I was satisfied with him and assured me that I should find the bacon excellent When I was about pushing from the boat he told me in a low voice though there was no one who could hear us except his own people--that he should be down the river again in about two weeks when he should be very glad to buy any produce that I had for sale adding I will give you half as much for cotton as it is worth in Charleston and pay you either in money or groceries as you may choose Take care and do not betray yourself and I shall be honest with you I was so much rejoiced at being in possession of a hundred pounds of good flitch bacon that I had no room in either my head or my heart for the consideration of this man's notions of honesty at the present time but paddled with all strength for our landing where we took the bacon from the canoe stowed it away in an old salt barrel and safely deposited it in a hole dug for the purpose in the floor of my cabin About this time our allowance of sweet potatoes was withheld from us altogether in consequence of the high price paid for this article by the captains of the keel-boats for the purpose as I heard of sending them to New-York and Philadelphia Ever since Christmas we had been permitted to draw on each Sunday evening either a peck of corn as usual or half a peck of corn and half a bushel of sweet potatoes at our discretion The half a peck of corn and the half a bushel of potatoes was worth much more than a peck of corn but potatoes were so abundant this year that they were of little value and the saving of corn was an object worth attending to by a large planter The boatmen now offered half a dollar a bushel for potatoes and we were again restricted to our corn ration Notwithstanding the privation of our potatoes we at the fishery lived sumptuously although our master certainly believed that our fare consisted of corn bread and river fish cooked without lard or butter It was necessary to be exceedingly cautious in the use of our bacon and to prevent the suspicions of the master and others who frequented our landing I enjoined our people never to fry any of the meat but to boil it all No one can smell boiled bacon far but fried flitch can be smelled a mile by a good nose We had two meals every night one of bacon and the other of fried shad which nearly deprived us of all appetite for the breakfasts and dinners that we prepared in the daytime consisting of cold corn bread without salt and broiled fresh water fish without any sort of seasoning We spent more than two weeks in this happy mode of life unmolested by our master his son or the master of the fishery when the latter complained rather than threatened us because we sometimes suffered our seine to float too far down the river and get entangled amongst some roots and brush that lay on the bottom immediately below our fishing ground We now expected every evening to see the return of the boatman who had sold us the bacon and the man who was with me in the canoe at the time we received it had not forgotten the invitation of the captain to trade with him in cotton on his return My fellow-slave was a native of Virginia as he told me and had been sold and brought to Carolina about ten years before this time He was a good natured kind hearted man and did many acts of benevolence to me such as one slave is able to perform for another and I felt a real affection for him but he had adopted the too common rule of moral action that there is no harm in a slave robbing his master The reader may suppose from my account of the bacon that I too had adopted this rule as a part of my creed but I solemnly declare that this was not the case and that I never deprived any one of all the masters that I have served of any thing against his consent unless it was some kind of food and that of all I ever took I am confident I have given away more than the half to my fellow-slaves whom I knew to be equally needy with myself The man who had been with me at the keelboat told me one day that he had laid a plan by which we could get thirty or forty dollars if I would join him in the execution of his project Thirty or forty dollars was a large sum of money to me I had never possessed so much money at one time in my life and I told him that I was willing to do any thing by which we could obtain such a treasure He then told me that he knew where the mule and cart that were used by the man who carried away our fish were kept at night and that he intended to set out on the first dark night and go to the plantation--harness the mule to the cart--go to the cotton-gin house--put two bags of cotton into the cart--bring them to a thicket of small pines that grew on the river bank a short distance below the fishery and leave them there until the keel-boat should return All that he desired of me was to make some excuse for his absence to the other hands and assist him to get his cotton into the canoe at the coming of the boat I disliked the whole scheme both on account of its iniquity and of the danger which attended it but my companion was not to be discouraged by all the arguments which I could use against it and if I would not participate in it he was determined to undertake it alone provided I would not inform against him To this I nothing but he had so often heard me express my detestation of one slave betraying another that I presume he felt easy on that score The next night but one after this conversation was very dark and when we went to lay out the seine after night Nero was missing The other people inquired of me if I knew where he was and when I replied in the negative little more was on the subject it being common for the slaves to absent themselves from habitations at night and if the matter is not discovered by the overseer or master nothing is ever of it by the slaves The other people supposed that in this instance Nero had gone to see a woman whom he lived with as his wife on a plantation a few miles down the river and were willing to work a little harder to permit him to enjoy the pleasure of seeing his family He returned before day and he had been to see his wife which satisfied the curiosity of our companions The very next evening after Nero's absence the keel-boat descended the river came down on our side hailed us at the fishery and drawing in to the shore below our landing made her ropes fast among the young pines of which I have spoken above After we made our first haul I missed Nero but he returned to us before we had laid out the seine and told us that he had been in the woods to collect some light-wood-- dry resinous pine--which he brought on his shoulder When the morning came the keel-boat was gone and every thing wore the ordinary aspect about our fishery but when the man came with the mule and the cart to take away the fish he told us that there was great trouble on the plantation The overseer had discovered that some one had stolen two bags of cotton the last night and all the hands were undergoing an examination on the subject The slaves on the plantation one and all denied having any knowledge of the matter and as there was no evidence against any one the overseer threatened at the time he left the quarter to whip every hand on the estate for the purpose of making them discover who the thief was The slaves on the plantation differed in opinion as to the perpetrator of this theft but the greater number concurred in charging it upon a free negro man named Ishmael who lived in a place called the White Oak Woods and followed making ploughs and harrow frames He also made handles for hoes and the frame work of cart bodies This man was generally reputed a thief for a great distance round the country and the black people charged him with stealing the cotton on no other evidence than his general bad character The overseer on the other hand expressed his opinion without hesitation which was that the cotton had been stolen by some of the people of the plantation and sold to a poor white man who resided at the distance of three miles back in the pine woods and was believed to have dealt with slaves as a receiver of their stolen goods for many years This white man was one of the class of poor cottagers to whom I have heretofore referred in this narrative The house or cabin in which he resided was built of small poles of the yellow pine with the bark remaining on them the roof was of clap-boards of pine and the chimney was made of sticks and mud raised to the height of eight or ten feet The appearance of the man and his wife was such as one might expect to find in such a dwelling The lowest poverty had through life been the companion of these poor people of which their clayey complexions haggard figures and tattered garments gave the strongest proof It appeared to me that the state of destitution in which these people lived afforded very convincing evidence that they were not in possession of the proceeds of the stolen goods of any person I had often been at the cabin of this man in my trapping expeditions the previous autumn and winter and I believe the overseer regarded the circumstance that black people often called at his house as conclusive evidence that he held criminal intercourse with them However this might be the overseer determined to search the premises of this harmless forester whom he resolved beforehand to treat as a guilty man It being known that I was well acquainted with the woods in the neighbourhood of the cabin I was sent for to leave the fishery and come to assist in making search for the lost bags of cotton--perhaps it was also believed that I was in the secrets of the suspected house It was not thought prudent to trust any of the hands on the plantation in making the intended search as they were considered the principal thieves whilst we of the fishery against whom no suspicion had arisen were required to give our assistance in ferreting out the perpetrators of an offence of the highest grade that can be committed by a slave on a cotton estate Before leaving the fishery I advised the master to be very careful not to let the overseer or my master know that he had left us to manage the fishery at night by ourselves since as a theft had been committed it might possibly be charged upon him if it were known that he had allowed us so much liberty I this to put the master on his guard against surprise and to prevent him from saying any thing that might turn the attention of the overseer to the hands at the fishery for I knew that if punishment were to fall amongst us it would be quite as likely to reach the innocent as the guilty--besides though I was innocent of the bags of cotton I was guilty of the bacon and however I might make distinctions between the moral turpitude of the two cases I knew that if discovered they would both be treated alike When I arrived at the quarter whither I repaired in obedience to the orders I received I found the overseer with my master's eldest son and a young white man who had been employed to repair the cotton-gin waiting for me I observed when I came near the overseer that he looked at me very attentively and afterwards called my young master aside and spoke to him in a tone of voice too low to be heard by me The white gentlemen then mounted their horses and set off by the road for the cabin of the white man I had orders to take a short route through the woods and across a swamp by which I could reach the cabin as soon as the overseer The attentive examination that the overseer had given me caused me to feel uneasy although I could not divine the cause of his scrutiny nor of the subject of the short conversation between him and my young master By travelling at a rapid pace I arrived at the cabin of the suspected man before the gentlemen but thought it prudent not to approach it before they came up lest it might be imagined that I had gone in to give information to the occupants of the danger that threatened them Here I had a hard struggle with my conscience which seemed to say to me that I ought at once to disclose all I knew concerning the lost bags of cotton for the purpose of saving these poor people from the terror that they must necessarily feel at the sight of those who were coming to accuse them of a great crime perhaps from the afflictions and sufferings attendant upon a prosecution in a court of justice These reflections were cut short by the arrival of the party of gentlemen who passed me where I sat at the side of the path with no other notice than a simple command of the overseer to come on I followed them into the cabin where we found the man and his wife with two little children eating roasted potatoes The overseer saluted this family by telling them that we had come to search the house for stolen cotton That it was well known that he had long been dealing with negroes and they were now determined to bring him to punishment I was then ordered to tear up the floor of the cabin whilst the overseer mounted into the loft I found nothing under the floor and the overseer had no better success above The wife was then advised to confess where her husband had concealed the cotton to save herself from being brought in as a party to the affair but this poor woman protested with tears that they were totally ignorant of the whole matter Whilst the wife was interrogated the father stood without his own door trembling with fear but as I could perceive indignant with rage The overseer who was fluent in the use of profane language exerted the highest degree of his vulgar eloquence upon these harmless people whose only crime was their poverty and whose weakness alone had invited the ruthless aggression of their powerful and rich neighbours Finding nothing in the house the gentlemen set out to scour the woods around the cabin and commanded me to take the lead in tracing out tree tops and thickets where it was most likely that the stolen cotton might be found Our search was in vain as I knew it would be beforehand but when weary of ranging in the woods the gentlemen again returned to the cabin which we now found without inhabitants The alarm caused by our visit and the manner in which the gentlemen had treated this lonely family had caused them to abandon their dwelling and seek safety in flight The door of the house was closed and fastened with a string to a nail in the post of the door After calling several times for the fugitives and receiving no answer the door was kicked open by my young master the few articles of miserable furniture that the cabin contained including a bed made of flags were thrown into a heap in the corner and fire was set to the dwelling by the overseer We remained until the flames had reached the roof of the cabin when the gentlemen mounted their horses and set off for home ordering me to return by the way that I had come When we again reached the house of my master several gentlemen of the neighbourhood had assembled drawn together by common interest that is felt amongst the planters to punish theft and particularly a theft of cotton in the bag My young master related to his neighbours with great apparent satisfaction the exploits of the morning he had routed one receiver of stolen goods out of the country and that all others of his character ought to be dealt with in the same manner In this opinion all the gentlemen present concurred and after much conversation on the subject it was agreed to call a general meeting for the purpose of devising the best surest and most peaceful method of removing from the country the many white men who residing in the district without property or without interest in preserving the morals of the slaves were believed to carry on an unlawful and criminal traffic with the negroes to the great injury of the planters in general and of the masters of the slaves who dealt with the offenders in particular I was present at this preliminary consultation which took place at my master's cotton-gin whither the gentlemen had repaired for the purpose of looking at the place where the cotton had been removed So many cases of this forbidden traffic between the slaves and these white negro dealers as they were termed were here related by the different gentlemen and so many white men were referred to by name as being concerned in this criminal business that I began to suppose the losses of the planters in this way must be immense This conference continued until I had totally forgotten the scrutinizing look that I had received from our overseer at the time I came up from the fishery in the morning but the period had now come when I again was to be reminded of this circumstance for on a sudden the overseer called me to come forward and let the gentlemen see me I again felt a sort of vague and undefinable apprehension that no good was to grow out of this examination of my person but a command of our overseer was not to be disobeyed After looking at my face with a kind of leer or side glance one of the gentlemen who was an entire stranger to me and whom I had never before seen boy you appear to live well how much meat does your master allow you in a week I was almost totally confounded at the name of meat and felt the blood rush to my heart but nevertheless forced a sort of smile upon my face and replied My master has been very kind to all his people of late but has not allowed us any meat for some weeks We have plenty of good bread and abundance of river fish which together with the heads and roes of the shad that we have salted at the landing makes a very excellent living for us though if master would please to give us a little meat now and then we should be very thankful for it This speech which contained all the eloquence I was master of at the time seemed to produce some effect in my favour for the gentleman nothing in reply until the overseer rising from a board on which he had been sitting came close up to me and Charles you need not tell lies about it you have been eating meat I know you have no negro could look as fat and sleek and black and greasy as you if he had nothing to eat but corn bread and river chubs You do not look at all as you did before you went to the fishery and all the hands on the plantation have had as many chubs and other river fish as they could eat as well as you and yet they are as poor as snakes in comparison with you Come tell us the truth let us know where you get the meat that you have been eating and you shall not be whipped I begged the overseer and the other gentlemen not to ridicule or make sport of me because I was a poor slave and was obliged to live on bread and fresh water fish and concluded this second harangue by expressing my thankfulness to God Almighty for giving me such good health and strength as to enable me to do my work and look so well as I did upon such poor fare adding that if I only had as much bacon as I could eat they would soon see a man of a different appearance from that which I now exhibited None of your palaver rejoined the overseer--Why I smell the meat in you this moment Do I not see the grease as it runs out of your face I was by this time in a profuse sweat caused by the anxiety of my feelings and simply Master sees me sweat I suppose All the gentlemen present then declared with one accord that I must have been living on meat for a long time as no negro who had no meat to eat could look as I did and one of the company advised the overseer to whip me and compel me to confess the truth I have no doubt but this advice would have been practically followed had it not been for a happy though dangerous suggestion of my own mind at this moment It was no other than a proposal on my part that I should be taken to the landing and if all the people there did not look as well and as much like meat-eaters as I did then I would agree to be whipped in any way the gentlemen should deem expedient This offer on my part was instantly accepted by the gentlemen and it was agreed amongst them that they would all go to the landing with the overseer partly for the purpose of seeing me condemned by the judgment to which I had voluntarily chosen to submit myself and partly for the purpose of seeing my master's new fishery We were quickly at the landing though four miles distant and I now felt confident that I should escape the dangers that beset me provided the master of the fishery did not betray his own negligence and lead himself as well as us into new troubles Though on foot I was at the landing as soon as the gentlemen and was first to announce to the master the feats we had performed in the course of the day adding with great emphasis and even confidence in my manner You know master fish-master whether we have had any meat to eat here or not If we had meat here would not you see it You have been up with us every night and know that we have not been allowed to take even shad let alone having meat to eat The fish-master supported me in all I declared we had been good boys--had worked night and day of his certain knowledge as he had been with us all night and every night since we began to fish That he had not allowed us to eat any thing but fresh water fish and the heads and roes of the shad that were salted at the landing As to meat he he was willing to be qualified on a cart load of testaments that there had not been a pound at the landing since the commencement of the season except that which he had in his own cabin I had now acquired confidence and desired the gentlemen to look at Nero and the other hands all of whom had as much the appearance of bacon eaters as myself This was the truth especially with regard to one of the men who was much fatter than I was The gentlemen now began to doubt the evidence of their own senses which they had held infallible heretofore I showed the fine fish that we had to eat cat perch mullets and especially two large pikes that had been caught to-day and assured them that upon such fare as this men must needs get fat I now perceived that victory was with me for once All the gentlemen faltered hesitated and began to talk of other affairs except the overseer who still ran about the landing swearing and scratching his head and saying it was strange that we were so fat whilst the hands on the plantation were as lean as sand-hill cranes He was obliged to give the affair over He was no longer supported by my young master and his companions all of whom congratulated themselves upon a discovery so useful and valuable to the planting interest and all determined to provide as soon as possible a proper supply of fresh river fish for their hands The two bales of cotton were never once named and I suppose were not thought of by the gentlemen when at the landing and this was well for Nero for such was the consternation and terror into which he was thrown by the presence of the gentlemen and their inquiries concerning our eating of meat that the sweat rolled off him like rain from the plant never-wet his countenance was wild and haggard and his knees shook like the wooden spring of a wheat-fan I believe that if they had charged him at once with stealing the cotton he would have confessed the deed XVI After this the fishing season passed off without any thing having happened worthy of being noticed here When we left the fishery and returned to the plantation which was after the middle of April the corn and cotton had all been planted and the latter had been replanted I was set to plough with two mules for my team and having never been accustomed to ploughing with these animals I had much trouble with them at first My master owned more than forty mules and at this season of the year they were all at work in the cotton field used instead of horses for drawing ploughs Some of the largest were hitched single to a plough but the smallest were coupled together On the whole the fishery had been a losing affair with me for although I had lived better at the landing than I usually did at the plantation yet I had been compelled to work all the time by night and by day including Sunday for my master by which I had lost all that I could have earned for my own benefit had I been on the plantation I had now become so well acquainted with the rules of the plantation and the customs of the country where I lived that I experienced less distress than I did at my first coming to the south We now received a shad every Sunday evening with our peck of corn The fish were those that I had caught in the spring and were tolerably preserved In addition to all this each one of the hands now received a pint of vinegar every week This vinegar was a great comfort to me As the weather became hot I gathered lettuce and other salads from my garden in the woods which with the vinegar and bread furnished me many a cheerful meal The vinegar had been furnished to us by our master more out of regard to our health than to our comfort but it greatly promoted both The affairs of the plantation now went on quietly until after the cotton had been ploughed and hoed the first time after replanting The working of the cotton crop is not disagreeable labour--no more so than the culture of corn--but we were called upon to perform a kind of labour than which none can be more toilsome to the body or dangerous to the health I have elsewhere informed the reader that my master was a cultivator of rice as well as of cotton Whilst I was at the fishery in the spring thirty acres of swamp land had been cleared off ploughed and planted in rice The water had now been turned off the plants and the field was to be ploughed and hoed When we were taken to the rice field the weather was very hot and the ground was yet muddy and wet The ploughs were to be dragged through the wet soil and the young rice had to be cleaned of weeds by the hand and hilled up with the hoe It is the common opinion that no stranger can work a week in a rice swamp at this season of the year without becoming sick and all the new hands three in number besides myself were taken ill within the first five days after we had entered this field The other three were removed to the sick room but I did not go there choosing rather to remain at the quarter where I was my own master except that the doctor who called to see me took a large quantity of blood from my arm and compelled pelted me to take a dose of some sort of medicine that made me very sick and caused me to vomit violently This happened on the second day of my illness and from this time I recovered slowly but was not able to go to the field again for more than a week Here it is but justice to my master to say that during all the time of my illness some one came from the great house every day to inquire after me and to offer me some kind of light and cool refreshment I might have gone to the sick room at any time if I had chosen to do so An opinion generally prevails amongst the people of both colours that the drug copperas is very poisonous--and perhaps it may be so if taken in large quantities--but the circumstance that it is used in medicine seems to forbid the notion of its poisonous qualities I believe copperas was mingled with the potion the doctor gave to me Some overseers keep copperas by them as a medicine to be administered to the hands whenever they become sick but this I take to be a bad practice for although in some cases this drug may be very efficacious it certainly should be administered by a more skilful hand than that of an overseer It however has the effect of deterring the people from complaining of illness until they are no longer able to work for it is the most nauseous and sickening medicine that was ever taken into the stomach Ignorant or malicious overseers may and often do misapply it as was the case with our overseer when he compelled poor Lydia to take a draught of its solution After the restoration of my health I resumed my accustomed labour in the field and continued it without intermission until I left this plantation We had this year as a part of our crop ten acres of indigo This plant is worked nearly after the manner of rice except that it is planted on high and dry ground whilst the rice is always cultivated in low swamps where the ground may be inundated with water but notwithstanding its location on dry ground the culture of indigo is not less unpleasant than that of rice When the rice is ripe and ready for the sickle it is no longer disagreeable but when the indigo is ripe and ready to cut the troubles attendant upon it have only commenced The indigo plant bears more resemblance to the weed called wild indigo which is common in the woods of Pennsylvania than to any other herb with which I am acquainted The root of the indigo plant is long and slender and emits a scent somewhat like that of parsley From the root issues a single stem straight hard and slender covered with a bark a little cracked on its surface of a gray colour towards the bottom green in the middle reddish at the extremity and without the appearance of pith in the inside The leaves ranged in pairs around the stalk are of an oval form--smooth soft to the touch furrowed above and of a deep green on the under side The upper parts of the plant are loaded with small flowers destitute of smell Each flower changes into a pod enclosing seed This plant thrives best in a rich moist soil The seeds are black very small and sowed in straight drills This crop requires very careful culture and must be kept free from every kind of weeds and grass It ripens within less than three months from the time it is sown When it begins to flower the top is cut off and as new flowers appear the plant is again pruned until the end of the season Indigo impoverishes land more rapidly than almost any other crop and the plant must be gathered in with great caution for fear of shaking off the valuable farina that lies in the leaves When gathered it is thrown into the steeping vat--a large tub filled with water--here it undergoes a fermentation which in twenty-four hours at farthest is completed A cock is then turned to let the water run into the second tub called the mortar or pounding tub the steeping vat is then cleaned out that fresh plants may be thrown in and thus the work is continued without interruption The water in the pounding tub is stirred with wooden buckets with holes in their bottoms for several days and after the sediment contained in the water has settled to the bottom of the tub the water is let off and the sediment which is the indigo of commerce is gathered into bags and hung up to drain It is afterwards pressed and laid away to dry in cakes and then packed in chests for market Washing at the tubs is exceedingly unpleasant both on account of the filth and the stench arising from the decomposition of the plants In the early part of June our shad that each one had been used to receive was withheld from us and we no longer received any thing but the peck of corn and pint of vinegar This circumstance in a community less severely disciplined than ours might have procured murmurs but to us it was only announced by the fact of the fish not being distributed to us on Sunday evening This was considered a fortunate season by our people There had been no exemplary punishment inflicted amongst us for several months we had escaped entirely upon the occasion of the stolen bags of cotton though nothing less was to have been looked for on that occurrence than a general whipping of the whole gang There was more or less of whipping amongst us every week frequently one was flogged every evening over and above the punishments that followed on each settlement day but these chastisements which seldom exceeded ten or twenty lashes were of little import I was careful for my own part to conform to all the regulations of the plantation When I no longer received my fish from the overseer I found it necessary again to resort to my own expedients for the purpose of procuring something in the shape of animal food to add to my bread and greens I had by this time become well acquainted with the woods and swamps for several miles round our plantation and this being the season when the turtles came upon the land to deposite their eggs I availed myself of it and going out one Sunday morning caught in the course of the day by travelling cautiously around the edges of the swamps ten snapping turtles four of which were very large As I caught these creatures I tied each one with hickory bark and hung it up to the bough of a tree so that I could come and carry it home at my leisure I afterwards carried my turtles home and put them into a hole that I dug in the ground four or five feet deep and secured the sides by driving small pieces of split timber into the ground quite round the circumference of the hole the upper ends of the timber standing out above the ground Into this hole I poured water at pleasure and kept my turtles until I needed them On the next Sunday I again went to the swamps to search for turtles but as the period of laying their eggs had nearly passed I had poor success to day only taking two turtles of the species called skill-pots-- a kind of large terrapin with a speckled back and red belly This day when I was three or four miles from home in a very solitary part of the swamps I heard the sound of bells similar to those which wagoners place on the shoulders of their horses At first the noise of bells of this kind in a place where they were so unexpected alarmed me as I could not imagine who or what it was that was causing these bells to ring I was standing near a pond of water and listening attentively I thought the bells were moving in the woods and coming toward me I therefore crouched down upon the ground under cover of a cluster of small bushes that were near me and lay not free from disquietude to await the near approach of these mysterious bells Sometimes they were quite silent for a minute or more at a time and then again would jingle quick but not loud They were evidently approaching me and at length I heard footsteps distinctly in the leaves which lay dry upon the ground A feeling of horror seized me at this moment for I now recollected that I was on the verge of the swamp near which the vultures and carrion crows had mangled the living bodies of the two murderers and my terror was not abated when a moment after I saw come from behind a large tree the form of a brawny famished-looking black man entirely naked with his hair matted and shaggy his eyes wild and rolling and bearing over his head something in the form of an arch elevated three feet above his hair beneath the top of which were suspended the bells three in number whose sound had first attracted my attention Upon a closer examination this frightful figure I perceived that it wore a collar of iron about its neck with a large padlock pendent from behind and carried in its hand a long staff with an iron spear in one end The staff like every thing else belonging to this strange spectre was black It slowly approached within ten paces of me and stood still The sun was now down and the early twilight produced by the gloom of the heavy forest in the midst of which I was added approaching darkness to heighten my dismay My heart was in my mouth all the hairs of my head started from their sockets I seemed to be rising from my hiding place into the open air in spite of myself and I gasped for breath The black apparition moved past me went to the water and kneeled down The forest re-echoed with the sound of the bells and their dreadful peals filled the deepest recesses of the swamps as their bearer drank the water of the pond in which I thought I heard his irons hiss when they came in contact with it I felt confident that I was now in the immediate presence of an inhabitant of a nether fiery world who had been permitted to escape for a time from the place of his torment and come to revisit the scenes of his former crimes I now gave myself up for lost without other aid than my own and began to pray aloud to heaven to protect me At the sound of my voice the supposed evil one appeared to be scarcely less alarmed than I was He sprang to his feet and at a single bound rushed into the water then turning he besought me in a suppliant and piteous tone of voice to have mercy upon him and not carry him back to his master The suddenness with which we pass from the extreme of one passion to the utmost bounds of another is inconceivable and must be assigned to the catalogue of unknown causes and effects unless we suppose the human frame to be an involuntary machine operated upon by surrounding objects which give it different and contrary impulses as a ball is driven to and fro by the batons of boys when they play in troops upon a common I had no sooner heard a human voice than all my fears fled as a spark that ascends from a heap of burning charcoal and vanishes to nothing I at once perceived that the object that had well nigh deprived me of my reason so far from having either the will or the power to injure me was only a poor destitute African negro still more wretched and helpless than myself Rising from the bushes I now advanced to the water side and desired him to come out without fear and to be assured that if I could render him any assistance I would do it most cheerfully As to carrying him back to his master I was more ready to ask help to deliver me from my own than to give aid to any one in forcing him back to his We now went to a place in the forest where the ground was for some distance clear of trees and where the light of the sun was yet so strong that every object could be seen My new friend now desired me to look at his back which was seamed and ridged with scars of the whip and the hickory from the pole of his neck to the lower extremity of the spine The natural colour of the skin had disappeared and was succeeded by a streaked and speckled appearance of dusky white and pale flesh colour scarcely any of the original black remaining The skin of this man's back had been again and again cut away by the thong and renewed by the hand of nature until it was grown fast to the flesh and felt hard and turbid He told me his name was Paul that he was a native of Congo in Africa and had been a slave five years that he had left an aged mother a widow at home as also a wife and four children that it had been his misfortune to fall into the hands of a master who was frequently drunk and whose temper was so savage that his chief delight appeared to consist in whipping and torturing his slaves of whom he owned near twenty but through some unaccountable caprice he had contracted a particular dislike against Paul whose life he now declared to me was insupportable He had then been wandering in the woods more than three weeks with no other subsistence than the land tortoises frogs and other reptiles that he had taken in the woods and along the shores of the ponds with the aid of his spear He had not been able to take any of the turtles in the laying season because the noise of his bells frightened them and they always escaped to the water before he could catch them He had found many eggs which he had eaten raw having no fire nor any means of making fire to cook his food He had been afraid to travel much in the middle of the day lest the sound of his bells should be heard by some one who would make his master acquainted with the place of his concealment The only periods when he ventured to go in search of food were early in the morning before people could have time to leave their homes and reach the swamp or late in the evening after those who were in pursuit of him had gone to their dwellings for the night This man spoke our language imperfectly but possessed a sound and vigorous understanding and reasoned with me upon the propriety of destroying a life which was doomed to continual distress He informed me that he had first run away from his master more than two years ago after being whipped with long hickory switches until he fainted That he concealed himself in a swamp at that time ten or fifteen miles from this place for more than six months but was finally betrayed by a woman who he sometimes visited that when taken he was again whipped until he was not able to stand an had a heavy block of wood chained to one foot which he was obliged to drag after him at his daily labour for more than three months when he found an old file with which he cut the irons from his ancle and again escaped to the woods but was retaken within little more than a week after his flight by two men who were looking for their cattle and came upon him in the woods where he was asleep On being returned to his master he was again whipped and then the iron collar that he now wore with the iron rod extending from one shoulder over his head to the other with the bells fastened at the top of the arch were put upon him Of these irons he could not divest himself and wore them constantly from that time to the present I had no instruments with me to enable we to release Paul from his manacles and all I could do for him was to desire him to go with me to the place where I had left my terrapins which I gave to him together with all the eggs that I had found to day I also caused him to lie down and having furnished myself with a flint-stone many of which lay in the sand near the edge of the pond and a handful of dry moss I succeeded in striking fire from the iron collar and made a fire of sticks upon which he could roast the terrapins and the eggs It was now quite dark and I was full two miles from my road with no path to guide me towards home but the small traces made in the woods by the cattle I advised Paul to bear his misfortunes as well as he could until the next Sunday when I would return and bring with me a file and other things necessary to the removal of his fetters I now set out alone to make my way home not without some little feeling of trepidation as I passed along in the dark shade of the pine trees and thought of the terrific deeds that had been done in these woods This was the period of the full moon which now rose and cast her brilliant rays through the tops of the trees that overhung my way and enveloped my path in a gloom more cheerless than the obscurity of total darkness The path I travelled led by sinuosities around the margin of the swamp and finally ended at the extremity of the cart-road terminating at the spot where David and Hardy had been given alive for food to vultures and over this ground I was now obliged to pass unless I chose to turn far to the left through the pathless forest and make my way to the high road near the spot where the lady had been torn from her horse I hated the idea of acknowledging to my own heart that I was a coward and dared not look upon the bones of a murderer at midnight and there was little less of awe attached to the notion of visiting the ground where the ghost of the murdered woman was reported to wander in the moonbeams than in visiting the scene where diabolical crimes had been visited by fiend-like punishment My opinion is that there is no one who is not at times subject to a sensation approaching fear when placed in situations similar to that in which I found myself this night I did not believe that those who had passed the dark line which separates the living from the dead could again return to the earth either for good or for evil but that solemn foreboding of the heart which directs the minds of all men to a contemplation of the just judgment which a superior and unknown power holds in reservation for the deeds of this life filled my soul with a dread conception of the unutterable woes which a righteous and unerring tribunal must award to the blood-stained spirits of the two men whose lives had been closed in such unspeakable torment by the side of the path I was now treading The moon had risen high above the trees and shone with a clear and cloudless light the whole firmament of heaven was radiant with the lustre of a mild and balmy summer evening Save only the droppings of the early dew from the lofty branches of the trees into the water which lay in shallow pools on my right and the light trampling of my own footsteps the stillness of night pervaded the lonely wastes around me But there is a deep melancholy in the sound of the heavy drop as it meets the bosom of the wave in a dense forest at night that revives in the memory the recollection of the days of other years and fills the heart with sadness I was now approaching the unhallowed ground where lay the remains of the remorseless and guilty dead who had gone to their final account reeking in their sins unatoned unblest and unwept Already I saw the bones whitened by the rain and bleached in the sun lying scattered and dispersed a leg here and an arm there whilst a scull with the tinder jaw in its place retaining allits teeth grinned a ghastly laugh with its front full in the beams of the moon which falling into the vacant sockets of the eye-balls reflected a pale shadow from these deserted caverns and played in twinkling lustre upon the bald and skinless forehead In a moment the night-breeze agitated the leaves of the wood and moaned in dreary sighs through the lofty pine tops the gale shook the forest in the depth of its solitudes a cloud swept across the moon and her light disappeared a flock of carrion crows disturbed in their roosts flapped their wings and fluttered over my head and a wolf who had been gnawing the dry bones greeted the darkness with a long and dismal howl I felt the blood chill in my veins and all my joints shuddered as if I had been smitten by electricity At least a minute elapsed before I recovered the power of self-government I hastened to fly from a place devoted to crime where an evil genius presided in darkness over a fell assembly of howling wolves and blood-snuffing vultures When I arrived at the quarter all was quiet The inhabitants of this mock-village were wrapped ill forgetfulness and I stole silently into my little loft and joined my neighbours in their repose Experience had made me so well acquainted with the dangers that beset the life of a slave that I determined as a matter of prudence to say nothing to any one of the adventures of this Sunday but went to work on Monday morning at the summons of the overseer's horn as if nothing unusual had occurred In the course of the week I often thought of the forlorn and desponding African who had so terrified me in the woods and who seemed so grateful for the succour I gave him I felt anxious to become better acquainted with this man who possessed knowledge superior to the common race of slaves and manifested a moral courage in the conversation that I had with him worthy of a better fate than that to which fortune had consigned him On the following Sunday having provided myself with a large file which I procured from the blacksmith shop belonging to the plantation I again repaired to the place at the side of the swamp where I had first seen the figure of this ill-fated man I expected that he would be in waiting for me at the appointed place as I had promised him that I would certainly come again at this time but on arriving at the spot where I had left him I saw no sign of any person The remains of the fire that I had kindled were here and it seemed that the fire had been kept up for several days by the quantity of ashes that lay in a heap surrounded by numerous small brands The impressions of human feet were thickly disposed around this decayed fire and the bones of the terrapins that I had given to Paul as well as the skeletons of many frogs were scattered upon the ground but there was nothing that showed that any one had visited this spot since the fall of the last rain which I now recollected had taken place on the previous Thursday From this circumstance I concluded that Paul had relieved himself of his irons and gone to seek concealment in some other place or that his master had discovered his retreat and carried him back to the plantation Whilst standing at the ashes I heard the croaking of ravens at some distance in the woods and immediately afterwards a turkey-buzzard passed over me pursued by an eagle coming from the quarter in which I had just heard the ravens I knew that the eagle never pursued the buzzard for the purpose of preying upon him but only to compel him to disgorge himself of his own prey for the benefit of the king of birds I therefore concluded that there was some dead animal in my neighbourhood that had called all these ravenous fowls together It might be that Paul had killed a cow by knocking her down with a pine knot and that he had removed his residence to this slaughtered animal Curiosity was aroused in me and I proceeded to examine the woods I had not advanced more than two hundred yards when I felt oppressed by a most sickening stench and saw the trees swarming with birds of prey buzzards perched upon their branches ravens sailing their boughs and clouds of carrion crows flitting about and poising themselves in the air in a stationary position after the manner of that most nauseous of all birds when it perceives or thinks it perceives some object of prey Proceeding onward I came in view of a large sassafras tree around the top of which was congregated a cloud of crows some on the boughs and others on the wing whilst numerous buzzards were sailing low and nearly skimming the ground This sassafras tree had many low horizontal branches attached to one of which I now saw the cause of so vast an assembly of the obscene fowls of the air The lifeless and putrid body of the unhappy Paul hung suspended by a cord made of twisted hickory bark passed in the form of a halter round the neck and firmly bound to a limb of the tree It was manifest that he had climbed the tree fastened the cord to the branch and then sprung off The smell that assailed my nostrils was too overwhelming to permit me to remain long in view of the dead body which was much mangled and torn though its identity was beyond question for the iron collar and the bells with the arch that bore them were still in their place The bells had preserved the corpse from being devoured for whilst I looked at it I observed a crow descend upon it and make a stroke at the face with its beak but the motion that this gave to the bells caused them to rattle and the bird took to flight Seeing that I could no longer render assistance to Paul who was now beyond the reach of his master's tyranny as well as of my pity I returned without delay to my master's house and going into the kitchen related to the household servants that I had found a black man hung in the woods with bells upon him This intelligence was soon communicated to my master who sent for me to come into the house to relate the circumstance to him I was careful not to tell that I had seen Paul before his death and when I had finished my narrative my master observed to a gentleman who was with him that this was a heavy loss to the owner and told me to go The body of Paul was never taken down but remained hanging where I had seen it until the flesh fell from the bones or was torn off by the birds I saw the bones hanging in the sassafras tree more than two months afterwards and the last time that I was ever in these swamps XVII An affair was now in progress which though the persons who were actors in it were far removed from me had in its effects a great influence upon the fortunes of my life I have informed the reader that my master had three daughters and that the second of the sisters was deemed a great beauty The eldest of the three was married about the time of which I now write to a planter of great wealth who resided near Columbia but the second had formed an attachment to a young gentleman whom she had frequently seen at the church attended by my master's family As this young man either from want of wealth or proper persons to introduce him had never been at my master's house my young mistress had no opportunity of communicating to him the sentiments she entertained towards him without violating the rules of modesty in which she had been educated Before she would attempt any thing which might be deemed a violation of the decorum of her sex she determined to take a new method of obtaining a husband She communicated to her father my master a knowledge of the whole affair with a desire that he would invite the gentleman of her choice to his house This the father resolutely opposed upon the ground that the young man upon whom his daughter had fixed her heart was without property and consequently destitute of the means of supporting his daughter in a style suitable to the rank she occupied in society A woman in love is not easily foiled in her purposes my young mistress by continual entreaties so far prevailed over the affections or more probably the fears of her father that he introduced the young man to his family and about two months afterwards my young mistress was a bride but it had been agreed amongst all the parties as I understood before the marriage that as the son-in-law had no land or slaves of his own he should remove with his wife to a large tract of land that my master owned in the new purchase in the state of Georgia In the month of September my master came to the quarter one evening at the time of our return from the field in company with his son-in-law and informed me that he had given me with a number of others of his slaves to his daughter and that I with eight other men and two or three women must set out on the next Sunday with my new master for his estate in Georgia whither we were to go to clear land build houses and make other improvements necessary for the reception of the newly-married lady in the following spring I was much pleased with the appearance and manners of my new master who was a young man apparently about twenty-seven or eight years old and of good figure We were to take with us in our expedition to Georgia a wagon to be drawn by six mules and I was appointed to drive the team Before we set off my young mistress came in person to the quarter and told us that all those who were going to the new settlement must come to the house where she furnished each of us with two full suits of clothes one of coarse woollen and the other of hempen cloth She also gave a hat to each of us and two pairs of shoes with a trifle in money and enjoined us to be good boys and girls and get things ready for her and that when she should come to live with us we should not be forgotten The conduct of this young lady was so different from that which I had been accustomed to witness since I came to Carolina that I considered myself highly fortunate in becoming her slave and now congratulated myself with the idea that I should in future have a mistress who would treat me kindly and if I behaved well would not permit me to want At the time appointed we set out for Georgia with all the tools and implements necessary to the prosecution of a new settlement My young master accompanied us and travelled slowly for several days to enable me to keep up with him We continued our march in this order until we reached the Savannah river at the town of Augusta where my master told me that he was so well satisfied with my conduct that he intended to leave me with the team to bring on the goods and the women and children but that he would take the men and push on as fast as possible to the new settlement and go to work until the time of my arrival He gave me directions to follow on and inquire for Morgan county Court House and that he would have a person ready there on my arrival to guide me to him and the people with him He then gave me twenty dollars to buy food for the mules and provisions for myself and those with me and left me on the high road master of myself and the team I was resolved that this striking proof of confidence on the part of my master should not be a subject of regret to him and pursued my route with the greatest diligence taking care to lay out as little money as possible for such things as I had to buy On the sixth day in the morning I arrived at our new settlement in the middle of a heavy forest of such timber as is common to that country with three dollars and twenty-five cents in my pocket part of the money given to me at Augusta This I offered to return but my master refused to take it and told me to keep it for my good conduct I now felt assured that all my troubles in this world were ended and that in future I might look forward to a life of happiness and ease for I did not consider labour any hardship if I was well provided with good food and clothes and my other wants properly regarded My master and the people who were with him had before our arrival with the wagon put up the logs of two cabins and were engaged when we came in covering one of them with clapboards In the course of the next day we completed both these cabins with puncheon floors and small glass windows the sash and glass for which I had brought in the wagon We put up two other cabins and a stable for the mules and then began to clear land After a few days my master told me he meant to go down into the settlements to buy provisions for the winter and that he should leave me to oversee the hands and carry on the work in his absence He accordingly left us taking with him the wagon and two boys one to drive the team and another to drive cattle and hogs which he intended to buy and drive to our settlement I now felt myself almost proprietor of our new establishment and believe the men left under my charge did not consider me a very lenient overseer I in truth compelled them to work very hard as I did myself At the end of a week my master returned with a heavy load of meal and bacon with salt and other things that we needed and the day following a white man drove to our station several cows and more than twenty hogs the greater part of which were breeders At this season of the year neither the hogs nor the cattle required any feeding at our hands The woods were full of nuts and the grass was abundant but we gave salt to our stock and kept the hogs in a pen two or three days to accustom them to the place We now lived very differently from what we did on my old master's plantation We had as much bacon every day as we could eat which together with bread and sweet potatoes which we had at will constituted our fare My master remained with us more than two months within which time we had cleared forty acres of ground ready for the plough but a few days before Christmas an event took place which in its consequences destroyed all my prospects of happiness and totally changed the future path of my life A messenger one day came to our settlement with a letter which had been forwarded in this manner by the postmaster at the Court House where the post-office was kept This letter contained intelligence of the sudden death of my old master and that difficulties had arisen in the family which required the immediate attention of my young one The letter was written by my mistress My master forthwith took all account of the stock of provisions and other things that he had on hand and putting the whole under my charge gave me directions to attend to the work and set off on horseback that evening promising to return within one month at furthest We never saw him again and heard nothing of him until late in the month of January when the eldest son of my late master came to our settlement in company with a strange gentleman The son of my late master informed me to my surprise and sorrow that my young waster who had brought us to Georgia was dead and that he and the gentleman with him were administrators of the deceased and had come to Georgia for the purpose of letting out on lease for the period of seven years our place with all the people on it including me To me the most distressing part of this news was the death of my young master and I was still more sorry when I learned that he had been killed in a duel My young mistress whose beauty had drawn around her numerous suiters many of whom were men of base minds and cowardly hearts had chosen her husband in the manner I have related and his former rivals after his return from Georgia confederated together for the dastardly purpose of revenging themselves of both husband and wife by the murder of the former In all parts of the cotton country there are numerous taverns which answer the double purpose of drinking and gambling houses These places are kept by men who are willing to abandon all pretensions to the character and standing of gentlemen for the hope of sordid gain and are frequented by all classes of planters though it is not to be understood that all the planters resort to these houses There are men of high and honourable virtue amongst the planters who equally detest the mean cupidity of the men who keep these houses and the silly wickedness of those who support them Billiard is the game regarded as the most polite amongst men of education and fashion but cards dice and every kind of game whether of skill or of hazard are openly played in these sinks of iniquity So far as my knowledge extends there is not a single district of ten miles square in all the cotton region without at least one of these vile ordinaries as they are frequently and justly termed The keeping of these houses is a means of subsistence resorted to by men of desperate reputation or reckless character and they invite as guests all the profligate the drunken the idle and the unwary of the surrounding country In a community where the white man never works except at the expense of forfeiting all claim to the rank of a gentleman and where it is beneath the dignity of a man to oversee the labour of his own plantation the number of those who frequent these gaming houses may be imagined My young master fortunately for his own honour was of those who kept aloof from the precincts of the tavern unless compelled by necessary business to go there but the band of conspirators who had resolved on his destruction invited him through one of their number who pretended to wish to treat with him concerning his property to meet them at an ordinary one evening Here a quarrel was sought him and he was challenged to fight with pistols over the table around which they sat My master who it appears was unable to bear the reproach of cowardice even amongst fools agreed to fight and as he had no pistols with him was presented with a pair belonging to one of the gang and accepted their owner as his friend or second in the business The result was as might have been expected My master was killed at the first fire by a ball which passed through his breast whilst his antagonist escaped unharmed A servant was immediately despatched with a letter to my mistress informing her of the death of her husband She was awakened in the night to read the letter the bearer having informed her maid that it was necessary for her to see it immediately The shock drove her into a feverish delirium from which she never recovered At periods her reason resumed its dominion but in the summer following she became a mother and died in child-bed of puerperal fever I obtained this account from the mouth of a black man who was the travelling servant of the eldest son of my old master and who was with his master at the time he came to visit the tenant to whom he let his sister's estate in Georgia in the year The estate to which I was now attached was advertised to be rented for the term of seven years with all the stock of mules cattle and so forth upon it--together with seventeen slaves six of whom were too young to be able to work at present The price asked was one thousand dollars for the first year and two thousand dollars for each of the six succeeding years the tenant to be bound to clear thirty acres of land annually Before the day on which the estate was to be let by the terms of the advertisement a man came from the neighbourhood of Savannah and agreed to take the new plantation on the terms asked He was immediately put intop ossession of the premises and from this moment I became his slave for the term of seven years Fortune had now thrown me into the power of a new master of whom when I considered the part of the country from whence he came which had always been represented to me as distinguished for the cruelty with which slaves were treated in it I had no reason to expect much that was good I had indeed from the moment I saw this new master and had learned the place of his former residence made up my mind to prepare myself for a harsh servitude but as we are often disappointed for the worse so it sometimes happens that we are deceived for the better This man was by no means so bad as I was prepared to find him and yet I experienced all the evils in his service that I had ever apprehended but I could never find in my heart to entertain a revengeful feeling towards him for he was as much a slave as I was and I believe of the two the greater sufferer Perhaps the evils he endured himself made him more compassionate of the sorrows of others but notwithstanding the injustice that was done me while with him I could never look upon him as a bad man At the time he took possession of the estate he was alone and did not let us know that he had a wife until after he had been with us at least two weeks One day however he called us together and told us that he was going down the country to bring up his family--that he wished us to go on with the work on the place in the manner he pointed out and telling the rest of the hands that they must obey my orders he left us He was gone full two weeks and when he returned I had all the cleared land planted in cotton corn and sweet potatoes and had progressed with the business of the plantation so much to his satisfaction that he gave me a dollar with which I bought a pair of new trousers--my old ones having been worn out in clearing the new land and burning logs My master's family a wife and one child came with him and my new mistress soon caused me to regret the death of my former young master for other reasons than those of affection and esteem This woman though she was my mistress I cannot call her lady was the daughter of a very wealthy planter who resided near Milledgeville and had several children besides my mistress My master was a native of North Carolina--had removed to Georgia several years before this--had acquired some property and was married to my mistress more than two years when I became his slave for a term of years as I have stated I saw many families and was acquainted with the moral character of many ladies while I lived in the south but I must in justice to the country say that my new mistress was the worst woman I ever saw amongst the southern people Her temper was as bad as that of a speckled viper and her language when she was enraged was a mere vocabulary of profanity and virulence My master and mistress brought with them when they came twelve slaves great and small seven of whom were able to do field work We now had on our new place a very respectable force and my master was a man who understood the means of procuring a good day's work from his hands as well as any of his neighbours He was also a man who when left to pursue his own inclinations was kind and humane in his temper and conduct towards his people and if he had possessed courage enough to whip his wife two or three times as he sometimes whipped his slaves and to compel her to observe a rule of conduct befitting her sex I should have had a tolerable time of my servitude with him and should in all probability have been a slave in Georgia until this day Before my mistress came we had meat in abundance for my master had left his keys with me and I dealt out the provisions to the people Lest my master should complain of me at his return or suspect that I had not been faithful to my trust I had only allowed ourselves for I fared in common with the others one meal of meat in each day We had several cows that supplied us with and a barrel of molasses was amongst the stores of provisions We had mush sweet potatoes milk molasses and sometimes butter for breakfast and supper and meat for dinner Had we been permitted to enjoy this fine fare after the arrival of our mistress and had she been a woman of kindly disposition and lady-like manners I should have considered myself well off in the world for I was now living in as good a country as I ever saw and I much doubt if there is a better one anywhere Our mistress gave us a specimen of her character on the first morning after her arrival amongst us by beating severely with a raw cow-hide the black girl who nursed the infant because the child cried and could not be kept silent I perceived by this that my mistress possessed no control over her passions and that when enraged she would find some victim to pour her fury upon without regard to justice or mercy When we were called to dinner to-day we had no meat and a very short supply of bread our meal being composed of badly cooked sweet potatoes some bread and a very small quantity of sour milk From this time our allowance of meat was withdrawn from us altogether and we had to live upon our bread potatoes and the little milk that our mistress permitted us to have The most vexatious part of the new discipline was the distinction that was made between us who were on the plantation before our mistress came to it and the slaves that she brought with her To these latter she gave the best part of the sour milk all the buttermilk and I believe frequently rations of meat We were not on our part I mean us of the old stock wholly without meat for our master sometimes gave us a whole flitch of bacon at once this he had stolen from his own smoke-house--I say stolen because he took it without the knowledge of my mistress and always charged us in the most solemn manner not to let her know that we had received it She was as negligent of the duties of a good housewife as she was arrogant in assuming the control of things not within the sphere of her domestic duties and never missed the bacon that our master gave to us because she had not taken the trouble of examining the state of the meat-house Obtaining all the meat we ate by stealth through our master our supplies were not regular coming once or twice a-week according to circumstances However I was satisfied of the good intentions of my master towards me I felt interested in his welfare and in a short time became warmly attached to him He fared but little better at the hands of my mistress than I did except that as he ate at the same table with her he always had enough of comfortable food but in the matter of ill language I believe my master and I might safely have put our goods together as a joint stock in trade without either the one or the other being greatly the loser I had secured the good opinion of my master and it was perceivable by any one that he had more confidence in me than in any of his other slaves and often treated me as the foreman of his people This aroused the indignation of my mistress who with all her ill qualities retained a sort of selfish esteem for the slaves who had come with her from her father's estate She seldom saw me without giving me her customary salutation of profanity and she exceeded all other persons that I have ever known in the quickness and sarcasm of the jibes and jeers with which she seasoned her oaths To form any fair conception of her volubility and scurrilous wit it was necessary to hear her more especially on Sunday morning or a rainy day when the people were all loitering about the kitchens which stood close round her dwelling She treated my master with no more ceremony than she did me Misery loves company it is and I verily believe that my master and I felt a mutual attachment on account of our mutual sufferings XVIII The country I now lived in was new and abounded with every sort of game common to a new settlement Wages were high and I could sometimes earn a dollar and a half a day by doing job work on Sunday The price of a day's work here was a dollar My master paid me regularly and fairly for all the work I did for him on Sunday and I never went anywhere else to procure work All his other hands were treated in the same way He also gave me an old gun that had seen much hard service for the stock was quite shattered to pieces and the lock would not strike fire I took my gun to a blacksmith in the neighbourhood and he repaired the lock so that my musket was as sure fire as any piece need be I found upon trial that though the stock and lock had been worn out the barrel was none the worse for the service it had undergone I now for the first time in my life became hunter in the proper sense of the word and generally managed my affairs in such a way as to get the half of Saturday to myself This I did by prevailing on my master to set my task for the week on Monday morning Saturday was appropriated to hunting if I was not obliged to work all day and I soon became pretty expert in the use of my gun I made salt licks in the woods to which the deer came at night and I shot them from a seat of clapboards that was placed on the branches of a tree Rackoons abounded here and were of a large size and fat at all seasons In the month of April I saw the ground thickly strewed with nuts the growth of the last year I now began to live well notwithstanding the persecution that my mistress still directed against me and to feel myself in some measure an independent man Serpents of various kinds swarmed in this country I have killed more than twenty rattle-snakes in a day and copper-heads were innumerable but the snake that I most dreaded was the moccason which is quite as venomous as the copper-head or rattle-snake and much more active and malicious Vipers and other poisonous reptiles were innumerable and in the swamps was a monstrous serpent though of rare occurrence which was really dangerous on account of its prodigious size This snake is of a brown colour with ashy white spots distributed over its body It lives by catching rabbits and squirrels rackoons and other animals I have no doubt that some of this species would attack and swallow children several years old I once shot one of these snakes that was more than eight feet long and as thick as the leg of an ordinary man When coiled up it appeared as large as a small calf lying in its resting place Panthers wolves and other beasts of prey were common in the woods I had always observed that snakes congregate either in large groups or in pairs and that if one snake is killed another is soon after seen near the same place I one day killed an enormous rattle-snake in the cotton field near my master's house This snake was full six feet in length of a corresponding thickness and had fangs an inch and three-quarters in length When dead I skinned it and stretched the skin on a board A few days after having occasion to cross a fence near where I had killed the large snake and jumping from the top of the fence upon the ground without looking down I alighted close beside another rattle-snake quite as large as the one I had killed This one was lying at full length and I was surprised that it did not attempt to bite me nor even to throw itself into coil It only sounded its rattles making a noise sufficiently loud to be heard a hundred yards I killed this snake also and seeing it appear to be full of something that it had eaten I ripped it open with my knife and found the whole cavity of its body stuffed full of corn meal that it had eaten in the house where my master kept his stores to which it had found access through some aperture in the logs of the house The snake was so full of meal that it could not coil itself and thus saved my life for the bite of such a snake as this was is almost certain death I knew a white man some time afterwards who was bitten by one of these large rattle-snakes in the hand as he was trying to punch it to death with a stick in a hollow stump and he died before he could be taken to his own house which was little more than a mile from the place where he was bitten A neighbour of my master was one day hunting deer in the woods with hounds and hearing one of his hounds cry out as if hurt by something the gentlemen proceeded to the spot and found his dog lying in the agonies of death and a great rattle-snake near him On examining the dog it was found that the snake had struck him with its fangs in the side and cut a deep gash in the skin The dog being heated with running death ensued almost instantly I had a dog of my own which I had brought with me from Carolina and which was an excellent hunting dog He would tree rackoons and bears and chase deer and was so faithful that I thought he would lose his life if necessary in my defence but dogs like men have a certain limit beyond which their friendship will not carry them at least it was so with my dog Being in the woods one Sunday at a place called the goose-pond a shallow pool of water to which wild geese resorted my dog came out of the cane to me with his bristles raised and showing by his conduct that he had seen something in the canes of which he was afraid I had gone to the pond that for the purpose of cutting and putting into the water some sticks of a tree that grows in that part of Georgia of which very good ropes can be made The timber is cut and thrown into the water until the bark becomes soft and loose and it is then peeled off beaten and split to pieces and of this bark ropes can be made nearly equal to hempen ropes I got a good deal of money by making ropes of this bark and selling them At the time I speak of I had my axe with me but was without my gun I endeavoured in vain to induce my dog to enter into the cane-brake and started on my way home my dog keeping a little in advance of me and frequently looking back I had not proceeded far before the cause of my dog's alarm became manifest Looking behind me I saw a huge panther creeping along the path after me in the manner that a cat creeps when stealing upon her prey I felt myself in danger and again endeavoured to urge my dog to attack the panther but I could not prevail on him to place himself between me and the wild beast I stood still for some time and the panther lay down on the ground still however looking attentively at me When I again moved forward the panther moved after me and when I stopped and turned round it stopped also In this way I proceeded alternately advancing and halting with the panther sometimes within twenty steps of me until I came in view of my master's clearing when the panther turned off into the woods and I saw it no more I do not know whether this panther was in pursuit of me or my dog but whether of the one or the other it showed but little fear of both of us and I believe that if alone it would not have hesitated to attack either of us As soon as the panther disappeared I went home and told my master of my adventure He sent immediately to the house of a gentleman who lived two miles distant who came and brought his dogs with him These dogs when joined to my master's made five in number I went to the woods and showed the place where the panther had left me and the dogs immediately scented the trail It was then late in the evening and the chase was continued until near day-break the next morning when the panther was forced to take a tree ten miles from my master's house It was shot by my master with his rifle and after it was dead we measured it from the end of the nose to the tip of the tail and found the whole length to be eleven feet and ten inches In the fall of this year I went with my master to the Indian country to purchase and bring to the settlement cattle and Indian horses We travelled a hundred miles from the residence of my master nearly west before we came to any Indian village The country where the Indians lived was similar in soil and productions to that in which my master had settled and I saw several fields of corn amongst the Indians of excellent quality and well enclosed with substantial fences I also saw amongst these people several log-houses with square hewn logs Some cotton was growing in small patches in the fields but this plant was not extensively cultivated Large herds of cattle were ranging in the woods and cost their owners nothing for their keeping except a small quantity of salt These cattle were of the Spanish breed generally speckled but often of a dun or mouse colour and sometimes of a leaden gray They universally had long horns and dark muzzles and stood high on their legs with elevated and bold fronts When ranging in droves in the woods they were the finest cattle in appearance that I ever saw They make excellent working oxen but their quarters are not so heavy and fleshy as those of the English cattle The cows do not give large quantities of milk The Indian horses run at large in the woods like the cattle and receive no feed from their owners unless on some very extraordinary occasion They are small but very handsome little horses I do not know that I ever saw one of these horses more than fourteen hands high but they are very strong and active and when brought upon the plantation and broken to work they are hardy and docile and keep fat on very little food The prevailing colour of these horses is black but many of them are beautiful grays with flowing manes and tails and of their size are fine horses My master bought fifty horses and more than a hundred of the cattle and hired seven Indians to help us to drive them into the settlement We had only a path to travel in-- no road having been opened to the Indian country of width sufficient for wagons to pass upon it and I was often surprised at the agility of the Indians in riding the unbroken horses along this path and through the cane-brakes which lined it on either side in pursuit of the cattle when any of them attempted to leave the drove With the horses we had but little trouble after we had them once started on the path but the cattle were much inclined to separate and wander in the woods for several days after we set out from the Nation--but the greatest trouble was experienced at the time we halted in the evening for the night Some of the cattle and many of the horses would wander off from the fire to a great distance in the woods if not prevented and might attempt to return to the Indian country To obviate this as soon as the fire was kindled and the Indians had taken their supper they would take off into the woods in all directions and stationing themselves at the distance of about half a quarter of a mile from the fire would set up such a horrible yelling and whooping that the whole forest appeared to be full of demons come to devour us and our drove too This noise never failed to cause both horse and cattle to keep within the circle formed by the Indians and I believe we did not lose a single beast on the whole journey My master kept many of the cattle and several of the horses which he used on the plantation instead of mules The residue he sold among the planters and I believe the expedition yielded him a handsome profit in the end it also afforded me an opportunity of seeing the Cherokee Indians in their own country and of contrasting the immense difference that exists between man in a state of civilization and industry and man in a state of barbarism and indolence Ever since I had been in the southern country vast numbers of African negroes had been yearly imported but this year the business ceased altogether and I did not see any African who was landed in the United States after this date I shall here submit to the reader the results of the observations I have made on the regulations of southern society It is my opinion that the white people in general are not nearly so well informed in the southern states as they are in those lying farther north The cause of this may not be obvious to strangers but to a man who has resided amongst the cotton plantations it is quite plain There is a great scarcity of schools throughout all the cotton country that I have seen because the white population is so thinly scattered over the country and the families live so far apart that it is not easy to get a sufficient number of children together to constitute a school The young men of the country who have received educations proper to qualify them for the profession of teachers are too proud to submit to this kind of occupation and strangers who come from the north will not engage in a service that is held in contempt unless they can procure large salaries from individuals or get a great number of pupils to attend their instructions whose united contributions may amount in the aggregate to a large sum Great numbers of the young men of fortune are sent abroad to be educated but thousands of the sons of land and slave-holders receive very little education and pass their lives in ignorant idleness The poor white children are not educated at all It is my opinion that the women are not better educated than the men A few of the great families live in a style of luxury and magnificence on their estates that people in the north are not accustomed to witness but this splendour is made up of crowds of slaves employed as household servants and a gaudy show of silver plate rather than in good houses or convenient furniture Good beef and good mutton such are seen in Philadelphia and New-York are not known on the cotton plantations Good butter is also a rarity and in the summer time sweet flour or sweet wheaten bread is scarcely to be looked for The flour is imported from the north or west and in the hot damp climate of the southern summer it cannot be kept from souring more than four or five weeks The temper of my mistress grew worse daily--if that could grow worse which was already as bad as it could be-- and her enmity against me increased the more she observed that my master confided in me To enhance my misfortunes the health of my master began about this time visibly to decline and towards the latter end of the autumn of this year he one day told me that he believed he should not live long as he already felt the symptoms of approaching decay and death This was a source of much anxiety and trouble to me for I clearly foresaw that if ever I fell under the unbridled dominion of my mistress I should regret the worst period of my servitude in South Carolina I was much afraid as the winter came on that my master might grow worse and pass to the grave in the spring for his disease was a consumption of the lungs and it is well known that the spring of the year which brings joy gladness and vitality to all creation animate and inanimate except the victim of consumption is often the season that consigns him to the grave XIX We passed this winter in clearing land after we had secured the crops of cotton and corn and nothing happened on our plantation to disturb the usual monotony of the life of a slave except that in the month of January my master informed me that he intended to go to Savannah for the purpose of purchasing groceries and such other supplies as might be required on the plantation in the following season and that he intended to take down a load of cotton with our wagon and team and that I must prepare to be the driver This intelligence was not disagreeable to me as the trip to Savannah would in the first place release me for a short time from the tyranny of my mistress and in the second would give me an opportunity of seeing a great deal of strange country I derived a third advantage in after times from this journey but which did not enter into my estimate of this affair at that time My master had not yet erected a cotton-gin on his place-- the land not being his own--and we hauled our cotton in the seed nearly three miles to be ginned for which we had to give one-fourth to the owner of the gin When the time of my departure came I loaded my wagon with ten bales of cotton and set out with the same team of six mules that I had driven from South Carolina Nothing of moment happened to me until the evening of the fourth day when we were one hundred miles from home My master stopped to-night for he travelled with me on his horse at the house of an old friend of his and I heard my master in conversation with this gentleman for such he certainly was give me a very good character and tell him that I was the most faithful and trusty negro that he had ever owned He also that if he lived to see the expiration of the seven years for which he had leased me he intended to buy me He much more of me and I thought I heard him tell his friend something about my mistress but this was spoken in a low tone of voice and I could not distinctly understand it When I was going away in the morning with my team this gentleman came out to the wagon and ordered one of his own slaves to help me to put the harness on my mules At parting he told me to stop at his house on my return and stay all night and I should always be welcome to the use of his kitchen if it should ever be my lot to travel that way again I mention these trifles to show that if there are hard and cruel masters in the south there are also others of a contrary character The slave-holders are neither more nor less than men some of whom are good and very many are bad My master and this gentleman were certainly of the number of the good but the contrast between them and some others that I have seen was unhappily for many of the slaves very great I shall hereafter refer to this gentleman at whose house I now was and shall never name him without honour nor think of him without gratitude As I travelled through the country with my team my chief employment beyond my duty of a teamster was to observe the condition of the slaves on the various plantations by which we passed on our journey and to compare things in Georgia as I now saw them with similar things in Carolina as I had heretofore seen them There is as much sameness amongst the cotton plantations in Georgia as there is amongst the various farms in New-York or New-Jersey He who has seen one cotton field has seen all other cotton fields bating the difference that naturally results from good and bad soils or good and bad culture but the contrast that prevails in the treatment of the slaves on different plantations is very remarkable We travelled a road that was not well provided with public houses and we frequently stopped for the night at the private dwellings of the planters and I observed that my master was received as a visiter and treated as a friend in the family whilst I was always left at the road with my wagon my master supplying me with money to buy food for myself and my mules It was my practice when we remained all night at these gentlemen's houses to go to the kitchen in the evening after I had fed my mules and eaten my supper and pass some time in conversation with the black people I might chance to find there One evening we halted before sundown and I unhitched my mules at the road about two hundred yards from the house of a planter to which my master went to claim hospitality for himself After I had disposed of my team for the night and taken my supper I went as usual to see the people of colour in the kitchen belonging to this plantation The sun had just set when I reached the kitchen and soon afterwards a black boy came in and told the woman who was the only person in the kitchen when I came to it that she must go down to the overseer's house She immediately started in obedience to this order and not choosing to remain alone in a strange house I concluded to follow the woman and see the other people of this estate When we reached the house of the overseer the coloured people were coming in from the field and with them came the overseer and another man better dressed than overseers usually are I stood at some distance from these gentlemen not thinking it prudent to be too forward amongst strangers The black people were all called together and the overseer told them that some one of them had stolen a fat hog from the pen carried it to the woods and there killed and dressed it that he had that day found the place where the hog had been slaughtered and that if they did not confess and tell who the perpetrators of this theft were they would all be whipped in the severest manner To this threat no other reply was made than a universal assertion of the innocence of the accused They were all then ordered to lie down upon the ground and expose their backs to which the overseer applied the thong of his long whip by turns until he was weary It was fortunate for these people that they were more than twenty in number which prevented the overseer from inflicting many lashes on any one of them When the whole number had received each in turn a share of the lash the overseer returned to the man to whom he had first applied the whip and told him he was certain that he knew who stole the hog and that if he did not tell who the thief was he would whip him all night He then again applied the whip to the back of this man until the blood flowed copiously but the sufferer hid his face in his hands and not a word The other gentleman then asked the overseer if he was confident this man had stolen the pig and receiving an affirmative answer he he would make the fellow confess the truth if he would follow his directions He then asked the overseer if he had ever tried cat-hauling upon an obstinate negro and was told that this punishment had been heard of but never practised on this plantation A boy was then ordered to get up run to the house and bring a cat which was soon produced The cat which was a large gray tom-cat was then taken by the well-dressed gentleman and placed upon the bare back of the prostrate black man near the shoulder and forcibly dragged by the tail down the back and along the bare thighs of the sufferer The cat sunk his nails into the flesh and tore off pieces of the skin with his teeth The man roared with the pain of this punishment and would have rolled along the ground had be not been held in his place by the force of four other slaves each one of whom confined a hand or a foot As soon as the cat was drawn from him the man he would tell who stole the hog and confessed that he and several others three of whom were then holding him had stolen the hog--killed dressed and eaten it In return for this confession the overseer he should have another touch of the cat which was again drawn along his back not as before from the head downwards but from below the hips to the head The man was then permitted to rise and each of those who had been named by him as a participator in stealing the hog was compelled to lie down and have the cat twice drawn along his back first downwards and then upwards After the termination of this punishment each of the sufferers was washed with salt water by a black woman and they were then all dismissed This was the most excruciating punishment that I ever saw inflicted on black people and in my opinion it is very dangerous for the claws of the cat are poisonous and wounds made by them are very subject to inflammation During all this time I had remained at the distance of fifty yards from the place of punishment fearing either to advance or retreat lest I too might excite the indignation of these sanguinary judges After the business was over and my feelings became a little more composed I thought the voice or the gentleman in good clothes was familiar to me but I could not recollect who he was nor where I had heard his voice until the gentlemen at length left this place and went towards the great house and as they passed me I recognized in the companion of the overseer my old master the negro trader who had bought me in Maryland and brought me to Carolina I afterwards learned from my master that this man had formerly been engaged in the African slave-trade which he had given up some years before for the safer and less arduous business of buying negroes in the north and bringing them to the south as articles of merchandise in which he had acquired a very respectable fortune--had lately married in a wealthy family in this part of the country and was a great planter Two days after this we reached Savannah where my master sold his cotton and purchased a wagon load of sugar molasses coffee shoes dry goods and such articles as we stood in need of at home and on the next day after I entered the city I again left it and directed my course up the country In Savannah I saw many black men who were slaves and who yet acted as freemen so far that they went out to work where and with whom they pleased received their own wages and provided their own subsistence but were obliged to pay a certain sum at the end of each week to their masters One of these men told me that he paid six dollars on every Saturday evening to his master and yet he was comfortably dressed and appeared to live well Savannah was a very busy place and I saw vast quantities of cotton piled up on the wharves but the appearance of the town itself was not much in favour of the people who lived in it On my way home I travelled for several days by a road different from that which we had pursued in coming down and at the distance of fifty or sixty miles from Savannah I passed by the largest plantation that I had ever seen I think I saw at least a thousand acres of cotton in one field which was all as level as a bowling-green There were as I was told three hundred and fifty hands at work in this field picking the last of the cotton from the burs and these were the most miserable looking slaves that I had seen in all my travels It was now the depth of winter and although the weather was not cold yet it was the winter of this climate and a man who lives on the Savannah river a few years will find himself almost as much oppressed with cold in winter there as he would be in the same season of the year on the banks of the Potomac if he had always resided there These people were as far as I could see totally without shoes and there was no such garment as a hat of any kind amongst them Each person had a coarse blanket which had holes cut for the arms to pass through and the top was drawn up round the neck so as to form a sort of loose frock tied before with strings The arms when the people were at work were naked and some of them had very little clothing of any kind besides this blanket frock The appearance of these people afforded the most conclusive evidence that they were not eaters of pork and that lent lasted with them throughout the year I again staid all night as I went home with the gentleman whom I have before noticed as the friend of my master who had left me soon after we quitted Savannah and I saw him no more until I reached home Soon after my return from Savannah an affair of a very melancholy character took place in the neighbourhood of my master's plantation About two miles from our residence lived a gentleman who was a bachelor and who had for his housekeeper a mulatto woman The master was a young man not more than twenty-five years old and the housekeeper must have been at least forty She had children grown up one of whom had been sold by her master the father of the bachelor since I lived here and carried away to the west This woman had acquired a most unaccountable influence over her young master who lived with her as his wife and gave her the entire command of his house and of every thing about it Before he came to live where he now did and whilst he still resided with his father to whom the woman then belonged the old gentleman perceiving the attachment of his son to this female had sold her to a trader who was on his way to the Mississippi river in the absence of the young man but when the latter returned home and learned what had been done he immediately set off in pursuit of the purchaser overtook him somewhere in the Indian territory and bought the woman of him at an advanced price He then brought her back and put her as his housekeeper on the place where he now lived left his father and came to rejoice in person with the woman On a plantation adjoining that of the gentleman bachelor lived a planter who owned a young mulatto man named Frank not more than twenty-four or five years old a very smart as well as handsome fellow Frank had become as much enamoured of this woman who was old enough to have been his mother as her master the bachelor was and she returned Frank's attachment to the prejudice of her owner Frank was in the practice of visiting his mistress at night a circumstance of which her master was suspicious and he forbade Frank from coming to the house This only heightened the flame that was burning in the bosoms of the lovers and they resolved after many and long deliberations to destroy the master She projected the plot and furnished the means for the murder by taking her master's gun from the place where he usually kept it and giving it to Frank who came to the house in the evening when the gentleman was taking his supper alone Lucy always waited upon her master at his meals and knowing his usual place of sitting had made a hole between two of the logs of the house towards which she knew his back would be at supper At a given signal Frank came quietly up to the house levelled the gun through the hole prepared for him and discharged a load of buck-shot between the shoulders of the unsuspecting master who sprang from his seat and fell dead beside the table This murder was not known in the neighbourhood until the next morning when the woman herself went to a house on an adjoining plantation and told it The murdered gentleman had several other slaves none of whom were at home at the time of his death except one man and he was so terrified that he was afraid to run and alarm the neighbourhood I knew this man well and believe he was afraid of the woman and her accomplice I never had any doubt of his innocence though he suffered a punishment upon no other evidence than mere suspicion far more terrible than any ordinary form of death As soon as the murder was known to the neighbouring gentlemen they hastened to visit the dead body and were no less expeditious in instituting inquiries after those who had done the bloody deed My master was amongst the first who arrived at the house of the deceased and in a short time half the slaves of the neighbouring plantations were arrested and brought to the late dwelling of the dead man For my own part from the moment I heard of the murder I had no doubt of its author Silence is a great virtue when it is dangerous to speak and I had long since determined never to advance opinions uncalled for in controversies between the white people and the slaves Many witnesses were examined by a justice of the peace before the coroner arrived but after the coming of the latter a jury was called and more than half a day was spent in asking questions of various black people without the disclosure of any circumstance which tended to fix the guilt of the murder upon any one My master who was present all this time at last desired them to examine me if it was thought that my testimony could be of any service in the matter as he wished me to go home to attend to my work I was sworn on the testament to tell the whole truth and stated at the commencement of my testimony that I believed Frank and Lucy to be the murderers and proceeded to assign the reasons upon which my opinion was founded Frank had not been present at this examination and Lucy who had been sworn had she knew nothing of the matter that at the time her master was shot she had gone into the kitchen for some milk for his supper and that on hearing the gun she had come into the room at the moment he fell to the floor and expired but when she opened the door and looked out she could neither hear nor see any one When Frank was brought in and made to touch the dead body which he was compelled to do because some that if he was the murderer the corpse would bleed at his touch he trembled so much that I thought he would fall but no blood issued from the wound of the dead man This compulsory touching of the dead had however in this instance a much more powerful effect in the conviction of the criminal than the flowing of any quantity of blood could have had for as soon as Frank had withdrawn his hand from the touch of the dead the coroner asked him in a peremptory tone as conscious of the fact why he had done this Frank was so confounded with fear and overwhelmed by this interrogatory that he lost all self-possession and cried out in a voice of despair that Lucy had made him do it Lucy who had left the room when Frank was brought in was now recalled and confronted with her partner in guilt but nothing could wring a word of confession from her She persisted that if Frank had murdered her master he had done it of his own accord and without her knowledge or advice Some one now for the first time thought of making search for the gun of the dead man which was not found in the place where he usually had kept it Frank he had committed the crime with this gun which had been placed in his hands by Lucy Frank Lucy and Billy a black man against whom there was no evidence nor cause of suspicion except that he was in the kitchen at the time of the murder were committed to prison in a new log-house on an adjoining plantation closely confined in irons and kept there a little more than two weeks when they were all tried before some gentlemen of the neighbourhood who held a court for that purpose Lucy and Frank were condemned to be hung but Billy was found not guilty although he was not released but kept in confinement until the execution of his companions which took place ten days after the trial On the morning of the execution my master told me and all the rest of the people that we must go to the hanging as it was termed by him as well as others The place of punishment was only two miles from my master's residence and I was there in time to get a good stand near the gallows' tree by which I was enabled to see all the proceedings connected with this solemn affair It was estimated by my master that there were at least fifteen thousand people present at this scene more than half of whom were blacks all the masters for a great distance round the country having permitted or compelled their people to come to this hanging Billy was brought to the gallows with Lucy and Frank but was permitted to walk beside the cart in which they rode Under the gallows after the rope was around her neck Lucy confessed that the murder had been designed by her in the first place and that Frank had only perpetrated it at her instance She she had at first intended to apply to Billy to assist her in the undertaking but had afterwards communicated her designs to Frank who offered to shoot her master if she would supply him with a gun and let no other person be in the secret A long sermon was preached by a white man under the gallows which was only the limb of a tree and afterwards an exhortation was delivered by a black man The two convicts were hung together and after they were quite dead a consultation was held among the gentlemen as to the future disposition of Billy who having been in the house when his master was murdered and not having given immediate information of the fact was held to be guilty of concealing the death and was accordingly sentenced to receive five hundred lashes I was in the branches of a tree close by the place where the court was held and distinctly heard its proceedings and judgment Some went to the woods to cut hickories whilst others stripped Billy and tied him to a tree More than twenty long switches some of them six or seven feet in length had been procured and two men applied the rods at the same time one standing on each side of the culprit one of them using his left hand I had often seen black men whipped and had always when the lash was applied with great severity heard the sufferer cry out and beg for mercy but in this case the pain inflicted by the double blows of the hickory was so intense that Billy never uttered so much as a groan and I do not believe he breathed for the space of two minutes after he received the first strokes He shrank his body close to the trunk of the tree around which his arm and legs were lashed drew his shoulders up to his head like a dying man and trembled or rather shivered in all his members The blood flowed from the commencement and in a few minutes lay in small puddles at the root of the tree I saw flakes of flesh as long as my finger fall out of the gashes in his back and I believe he was insensible during all the time that he was receiving the last two hundred lashes When the whole five hundred lashes had been counted by the person appointed to perform this duty the half dead body was unbound and laid in the shade of the tree upon which I sat The gentlemen who had done the whipping eight or ten in number being joined by their friends then came under the tree and drank punch until their dinner was made ready under a booth of green boughs at a short distance After dinner Billy who had been groaning on the ground where he was laid was taken up placed in the cart in which Lucy and Frank had been brought to the gallows and conveyed to the dwelling of his late master where he was confined to the house and his bed more than three months and was never worth much afterwards while I remained in Georgia Lucy and Frank after they had been half an hour upon the gallows were cut down and suffered to drop into a deep hole that had been dug under them whilst they were suspended As they fell so the earth was thrown upon them and the grave closed over them for ever They were hung on Thursday and the vast assemblage of people that had convened to witness their death did not leave the place altogether until the next Monday morning Wagons carts and carriages had been brought upon the ground booths and tents erected for the convenience and accommodation of the multitude and the terrible spectacles that I have just described were succeeded by music dancing trading in horses gambling drinking fighting and every other species of amusement and excess to which the southern people are addicted I had to work in the day-time but went every night to witness this funereal carnival the numbers that joined in which appeared to increase rather than diminish during the Friday and Saturday that followed the execution It was not until Sunday afternoon that the crowd began sensibly to diminish and on Monday morning after breakfast time the last wagons left the ground now trampled into dust as dry and as light as ashes and the grave of the murderers was left to the solitude of the woods Certainly those who were hanged well deserved their punishment but it was a very arbitrary exercise of power to whip a man until he was insensible because he did not prevent a murder which was committed without his knowledge and I could not understand the right of punishing him because he was so weak or timorous as to refrain from the disclosure of the crime the moment it came to his knowledge It is necessary for the southern people to be vigilant in guarding the moral condition of their slaves and even to punish the intention to commit crimes when that intention can be clearly proved for such is the natural relation of master and slave in by far the greater number of cases that no cordiality of feeling can ever exist between them and the sentiments that bind together the different members of society in a state of freedom and social equality being absent the master must resort to principles of physical restraint and rules of mental coercion unknown in another and a different condition of the social compact It is a mistake to suppose that the southern planters could ever retain their property or live amongst their slaves if those slaves were not kept in terror of the punishment that would follow acts of violence disorder There is no difference between the feelings of the different races of men so far as their personal rights are concerned The black man is as anxious to possess and to enjoy liberty as the white one would be were he deprived of this inestimable blessing It is not for me to say that the one is as well qualified for the enjoyment of liberty as the other Low ignorance moral degradation of character and mental depravity are inseparable companions and in the breast of an ignorant man the passions of envy and revenge hold unbridled dominion It was in the month of April that I witnessed the painful spectacle of two fellow-creatures being launched into the abyss of eternity and a third being tortured beyond the sufferings of mere death not for his crimes but as a terror to others and this not to deter others from the commission of crimes but to stimulate them to a more active and devoted performance of their duties to their owners My spirits had not recovered from the depression produced by that scene in which my feelings had been awakened in the cause of others when I was called to a nearer and more immediate apprehension of sufferings which I now too clearly saw were in preparation for myself My master's health became worse continually and I expected he would not survive this summer In this however I was disappointed but he was so ill that he was seldom able to come to the field and paid but little attention to his plantation or the culture of his crops He left the care of the cotton field to me after the month of June and was not again out on the plantation before the following October when he one day came out on a little Indian pony that he had used as his hackney before he was so far reduced as to decline the practice of riding I suffered very much this summer for want of good and substantial provisions my master being no longer able to supply me with his usual liberality from his own meat house I was obliged to lay out nearly all my other earnings in the course of the summer for bacon to enable me to bear the hardship and toil to which I was exposed My master often sent for me to come to the house and talked to me in a very kind manner and I believe that no hired overseer could have carried on the business more industriously than I did until the crop was secured the next winter Soon after my master was in the field in October he sent for me to come to him one day and gave me on parting a pretty good great coat of strong drab cloth almost new which he would be of service to me in the coming winter He also gave me at the same time a pair of boots which he had worn half out but the legs of which were quite good This great coat and these boots were afterwards of great service to me As the winter came on my master grew worse and though he still continued to walk about the house in good weather it was manifest that he was approaching the close of his earthly existence I worked very hard this winter The crop of cotton was heavy and we did not get it all out of the field until some time after Christmas which compelled me to work hard myself and cause my fellow-slaves to work hard too in clearing the land that my master was bound to clear every year on this place He desired me to get as much of the land cleared in time for cotton as I could and to plant the rest with corn when cleared off As I was now entrusted with the entire superintendence of the plantation by my master who never left his house it became necessary for me to assume the authority of an overseer of my fellow-slaves and I not unfrequently found it proper to punish them with stripes to compel them to perform their work At first I felt much repugnance against the use of the hickory the only instrument with which I punished offenders but the longer I was accustomed to this practice the more familiar and less offensive it became to me and I believe that a few years of perseverance and experience would have made me as inveterate a negro-driver as any in Georgia though I feel conscious that I never should have become so hardened as to strip a person for the purpose of whipping nor should I ever have consented to compel people to work without a sufficiency of good food if I had it in my power to supply them with enough of this first of comforts In the month of February my master became so weak and his cough was so distressing that he took to his bed from which he never again departed save only once before the time when he was removed to be wrapped in his winding-sheet In the month of March two of the brothers of my mistress came to see her and remained with her until after the death of my master When they had been with their sister about three weeks they came to the kitchen one day when I had come in for my dinner and told me that they were going to whip me I asked them what they were going to whip me for to which they replied that they thought a good whipping would be good for me and that at any rate I must prepare to take it My mistress now joined us and after swearing at me in the most furious manner for a space of several minutes and bestowing upon me a multitude of the coarsest epithets told me that she had long owed me a whipping and that I should now get it She then ordered me to take off my shirt the only garment I had on except a pair of old tow linen trowsers and the two brothers backed the command of their sister the one by presenting a pistol at my breast and the other by drawing a large club over his head in the attitude of striking me Resistance was vain and I was forced to yield My shirt being off I was tied by the hands with a stout bed-cord and being led to a tree called the Pride of China that grew in the yard my hands were drawn by the rope being passed over a limb until my feet no longer touched the ground Being thus suspended in the air by the rope and my whole weight hanging on my wrists I was unable to move any part of my person except my feet and legs I had never been whipped since I was a boy and felt the injustice of the present proceeding with the utmost keenness but neither justice nor my feelings had any influence upon the hearts of my mistress and her brothers two men as cruel in temper and as savage in manners as herself The first strokes of the hickory produced a sensation that I can only liken to streams of scalding water running along my back but after a hundred or hundred and fifty lashes had been showered upon me the pain became less acute and piercing but was succeeded by a dead and painful aching which seemed to extend to my very backbone As I hung by the rope the moving of my legs sometimes caused me to turn round and soon after they began to beat me I saw the pale and death-like figure of my master standing at the door when my face was turned toward the house and heard him in a faint voice scarcely louder than a strong breathing commanding his brothers-in-law to let me go These commands were disregarded until I had received full three hundred lashes and doubtlessly more would have been inflicted upon me had not my master with an effort beyond his strength by the aid of a stick on which he supported himself made his way to me and placing his skeleton form beside me as I hung told his brothers-in-law that if they struck another stroke he would send for a lawyer and have them both prosecuted at law This interposition stopped the progress of my punishment and after cutting me down they carried my master again into the house I was yet able to walk and went into the kitchen whither my mistress followed and compelled me to submit to be washed in brine by a black woman who acted as her cook I was then permitted to put my shirt on and to go to my bed This was Saturday and on the next day when I awoke late in the morning I found myself unable to turn over or to rise I felt too indignant at the barbarity with which I had been treated to call for help from any one and lay in my bed made of corn husks until after twelve o'clock when my mistress came to me and asked me how I was A slave must not manifest feelings of resentment and I answered with humility that I was very sore and unable to get up She then called a man and a woman who came and raised me up but I now found that my shirt was as fast to my back as if it had grown there The blood and bruised flesh having become incorporated with the substance of the linen it formed only the outer coat of the great scab that covered my back After I was down stairs my mistress had me washed in warm water and warm grease was rubbed over my back and sides until the shirt was saturated with oil and becoming soft was at length separated from my back My mistress then had my back washed and greased and put upon me one of my master's old linen shirts She had become alarmed and was fearful either that I should die or would not be able to work again for a long time As it was she lost a month of my labour at this time and in the end she lost myself in consequence of this whipping As soon as I was able to walk my master sent for me to come to his bed-side and told me that he was very sorrow for what had happened that it was not his fault and that if he had been well I should never have been touched Tears came in his eyes as he talked to me and that as he could not live long he hoped I would continue faithful to him whilst he did live This I promised to do for I really loved my master but I had already determined that as soon as he was in his grave I would attempt to escape from Georgia and the cotton country if my life should be the forfeiture of the attempt As soon as I had recovered of my wounds I again went to work not in my former situation of superintendent of my master's plantation for this place was now occupied by one of the brothers of my mistress but in the woods where my mistress had determined to clear a new field After this time I did nothing but grub and clear land while I remained in Georgia but I was always making preparations for my departure from that country My master was an officer of militia and had a sword which he wore on parade days and at other times he hung it up in the room where he slept I conceived an idea that this sword would be of service to me in the long journey that I intended to undertake One evening when I had gone in to see my master and had remained standing at his bed-side some time he closed his eyes as if going to sleep and it being twilight I slipped the sword from the place where it hung and dropped it out of the window I knew my master could never need this weapon again but yet I felt some compunction of conscience at the thought of robbing so good a man When I left the room I took up the sword and afterwards secreted it in a hollow tree in the woods near the place at which I worked daily XX My master died in the month of May and I followed him to his grave with a heavy heart for I felt that I had lost the only friend I had in the world who possessed at once the power and the inclination to protect me against the tyranny and oppression to which slaves on a cotton plantation are subject Had he lived I should have remained with him and never have left him for he had promised to purchase the residue of my time of my owners in Carolina but when he was gone I felt the parting of the last tie that bound me to the place where I then was and my heart yearned for my wife and children from whom I had now been separated more than four years I held my life in small estimation if it was to be worn out under the dominion of my mistress and her brothers though since the death of my master she had greatly meliorated my condition by giving me frequent allowances of meat and other necessaries I believe she entertained some vague apprehensions that I might run away and betake myself to the woods for a living perhaps go to the Indians but I do not think she ever suspected that I would hazard the untried undertaking of attempting to make my way back to Maryland My purpose was fixed and now nothing could shake it I only waited for a proper season of the year to commence my toilsome and dangerous journey As I must of necessity procure my own subsistence on my march it behoved me to pay regard to the time at which I took it up I furnished myself with a fire-box as it is called that is a tin case containing flints steel and tinder this I considered indispensable I took the great coat that my master had given me and with a coarse needle and thread quilted a scabbard of old cloth in one side of it in which I could put my sword and carry it with safety I also procured a small bag of linen that held more than a peck This bag I filled with the meal of parched corn grinding the corn after it was parched in the wood where I worked at the mill at night These operations except the grinding of the corn I carried on in a small conical cabin that I had built in the woods The boots that my master gave me I had repaired by a Spaniard who lived in the neighbourhood and followed the business of a cobbler Before the first of August I had all my preparations completed and had matured them with so much secrecy that no one in the country white or black suspected me of entertaining any extraordinary design I only waited for the corn to be ripe and fit to be roasted which time I had fixed as the period of my departure I watched the progress of the corn daily and on the eighth of August I perceived on examining my mistress' field that nearly half of the ears were so far grown that by roasting them a man could easily subsist himself and as I knew that this corn had been planted later than the most of the corn in the country I resolved to take leave of the plantation and its tenants for ever on the next day I had a faithful dog called Trueman and this poor animal had been my constant companion for more than four years without ever showing cowardice or infidelity but once and that was when the panther followed us from the woods I was accordingly anxious to bring my dog with me but as I knew the success of my undertaking depended on secrecy and silence I thought it safest to abandon my last friend and engage in my perilous enterprise alone On the morning of the ninth I went to work as usual carrying my dinner with me and worked diligently at grubbing until about one o'clock in the day I now sat down and took my last dinner as the slave of my mistress dividing the contents of my basket with my dog After I had finished I tied my dog with a rope to a small tree I set my gun against it for I thought I should be better without the gun than with it tied my knapsack with my bag of meal on my shoulders and then turned to take a last farewell of my poor dog that stood by the tree to which he was bound looking wistfully at me When I approached him he licked my hands and then rising on his hind feet and placing his fore paws on my breast he uttered a long howl which thrilled through my heart as if he had My master do not leave me behind you All the affection that the poor animal had testified for me in the course of his life now rose fresh in my memory I recollected that he had always been ready to lay down his life for me that when I was tied and bound to the tree to be whipped they were forced to compel me to order my dog to be quiet to prevent him from attacking my executioner in my defence and even when he fled from the panther he had not left me only advancing a few feet before me and beckoning me to fly from an enemy whose strength was too great for us to contend against with hope of success and I now felt assured that had the panther attacked me my dog would have conquered at my side or have died in defending me This was the first time that I had ever tied him I had often left him for a whole day to guard my coat my basket or my gun which he never deserted and he now seemed to feel that I charge him with ingratitude and infidelity when I bound him to a charge which I had never known him to forsake As I was now leaving my dog for ever I talked to him as to a creature that understood language and was sensible of the dangers I was going to meet Poor Trueman faithful Trueman fare thee well Thou hast been an honest dog and sure friend to thy master in all his shades of fortune When my basket was well filled how cheerfully we have partaken together of its contents I did not then upbraid thee that thou atest in idleness the proceeds of my labour for I knew that thy heart was devoted to thy protector In the day of my adversity when all the world had forsaken me when my master was dead and I had no friend to protect me still poor Trueman thou wert the same Thou laidest thyself down at my feet when the world had united to oppress me How often when I was sick and the fever raged in my veins didst thou come at the going down of the sun and lick my feet in token of thy faith and how patiently didst thou watch with thy poor master through the long and lonely night When I had no crumbs in my basket to give thee nor crust in my pocket to divide with thee thy faithful heart failed not and a glance from the eye of thy hungry master filled thee with gratitude and joy Poor dog I must bid thee farewell To-morrow they will come and release thee Perhaps they will hate thee for my sake and persecute thee as they have persecuted me but I leave thee my gun to secure thee protection at the hands of those who will be the arbiters of thy fate when I am gone It is all the legacy I can give thee and surely they will not kill so good a dog when they see him possessed of so true a gun Man is selfish and heartless-- the richest of them all are as wretched slaves as I am and are only minions of fear and avarice Could pride and ambition witness thy fidelity and gratitude to thy forsaken master and learn humility from thy example how many tears would be wiped from the eyes of sorrow Follow the new master who shall possess my gun and may he be as kind to thee as thou hast been faithful to me I now took to the forest keeping as nearly as I could a north course all the afternoon Night overtook me before I reached any watercourse or any other object worthy of being noticed and I lay down and slept soundly without kindling a fire or eating any thing I was awake before day and as soon as there was light enough to enable me to see my way I resumed my journey and walked on until about eight o'clock when I came to a river which I knew must be the Appalachie I sat down on the bank of the river opened my bag of meal and made my breakfast of a part of its contents I used my meal very sparingly it being the most valuable treasure that I now possessed though I had in my pocket three Spanish dollars but in my situation this money could not avail me any thing as I was resolved not to show myself to any person either white or black After taking my breakfast I prepared to cross the river which was here about a hundred yards wide with a sluggish and deep current The morning was sultry and the thickets along the margin of the river teemed with insects and reptiles By sounding the river with a pole I found the stream too deep to be waded and I therefore prepared to swim it For this purpose I stripped myself and bound my clothes on the top of my knapsack and my bag of meal on the top of my clothes then drawing my knapsack close up to my head I threw myself into the river In my youth I had learned to swim in the Patuxent and have seldom met with any person who was more at ease in deep water than myself I kept a straight line from the place of my entrance into the Appalchie to the opposite side and when I had reached it stepped on the margin of the land and turned round to view the place from which I had set out on my aquatic passage but my eye was arrested by an object nearer to me than the opposite shore Within twenty feet of me in the very line that I had pursued in crossing the river a large alligator was moving in full pursuit of me with his nose just above the surface in the position that creature takes when he gives chase to his intended prey in the water The alligator can swim more than twice as fast as a man for he can overtake young ducks on the water and had I been ten seconds longer in the river I should have been dragged to the bottom and never again been heard of Seeing that I had gained the shore my pursuer turned made two or three circles in the water close by me and then disappeared I received this admonition as a warning of the dangers that I must encounter in my journey to the north After adjusting my clothes I again took to the woods and bore a little to the east of north it now being my determination to turn down the country so as to gain the line of the roads by which I had come to the south I travelled all day in the woods but a short time before sundown came within view of an opening in the forest which I took to be cleared fields but upon a closer examination finding no fences or other enclosures around it I advanced into it and found it to be an open savannah with a small stream of water creeping slowly through it At the lower side of the open space were the remains of an old beaver dam the central part of which had been broken away by the current of the stream at the time of some flood Around the margin of this former pond I observed several decayed beaver lodges and numerous stumps of small trees that had been cut down for the food or fortifications of this industrious little nation which had fled at the approach of the white man and all its people were now like me seeking refuge in the deepest solitudes of the forest from the glance of every human eye As it was growing late and I believed I must now be near the settlements I determined to encamp for the night beside this old beaver dam I again took my supper from my bag of meal and made my bed for the night amongst the canes that grew in the place This night I slept but little for it seemed as if all the owls in the country had assembled in my neighbourhood to perform a grand musical concert Their hooting and chattering commenced soon after dark and continued until the dawn of day In all parts of the southern country the owls are very numerous especially along the margins of streams and in the low grounds with which the waters are universally bordered but since I had been in the country although I had passed many nights in the woods at all seasons of the year I had never before heard so clamorous and deafening a chorus of nocturnal music With the coming of morning I arose from my couch and proceeded warily along the woods keeping a continual lookout for plantations and listening attentively to every noise that I heard in the trees or amongst the cane-brakes When the sun had been up two or three hours I saw an appearance of blue sky at a distance through the trees which proved that the forest had been removed from a spot somewhere before me and at no great distance from me and as I cautiously advanced I heard the voices of people in loud conversation Sitting down amongst the palmetto plants that grew around me in great numbers I soon perceived that the people whose conversation I heard were coming nearer to me I now heard the sound of horses' feet and immediately afterwards saw two men on horseback with rifles on their shoulders riding through the woods and moving on a line that led them past me at a distance of about fifty or sixty yards Perceiving that these men were equipped as hunters I remained almost breathless for the purpose of hearing their conversation When they came so near that I could distinguish their words they were talking of the best place to take a stand for the purpose of seeing the deer from which I inferred that they had sent men to some other point for the purpose of rousing the deer with dogs After they had passed that point of their way that was nearest to me and were beginning to recede from me one of them asked the other if he had heard that a negro had run away the day before yesterday in Morgan county to which his companion answered in the negative The first then he had seen an advertisement at the store which offered a hundred dollars reward for the runaway whose name was Charles The conversation of these horsemen was now interrupted by the cry of hounds at a distance in the woods and heightening the speed of their horses they were soon out of my sight and hearing Information of the state of the country through which I was travelling was of the highest value to me and nothing could more nearly interest me than a knowledge of the fact that my flight was known to the white people who resided round about and before me It was now necessary for me to become doubly vigilant and to concert with myself measures of the highest moment The first resolution that I took was that I would travel no more in the day-time This was the season of hunting deer and knowing that the hunters were under the necessity of being as silent as possible in the woods I saw at a glance that they would be at least as likely to discover me in the forest before I could see them as I should be to see them before I myself could be seen I was now very hungry but exceedingly loath to make any further breaches on my bag of meal except in extreme necessity Feeling confident that there was a plantation within a few rods of me I was anxious to have a view of it in hope that I might find a corn-field upon it from which I could obtain a supply of roasting ears Fearful to stand upright I crept along through the low ground where I then was at times raising myself to my knees for the purpose of obtaining a better view of things about me In this way I advanced until I came in view of a high fence and beyond this saw cotton tall and flourishing but no sign of corn I crept up close to the fence where I found the trunk of a large tree that had been felled in clearing the field Standing upon this and looking over the plantation I saw the tassels of corn at the distance of half a mile growing in a field which was bordered on one side by the wood in which I stood It was now nine or ten o'clock in the morning and as I had slept but little the night before I crept into the bushes great numbers of which grew in and about the top of the fallen tree and hungry as I was fell asleep When I awoke it appeared to me from the position of the sun which I had carefully noted before I lay down to be about one or two o'clock As this was the time of the day when the heat is most oppressive and when every one was most likely to be absent from the forest I again moved and taking a circuitous route at some distance from the fields reached the fence opposite the corn-field without having met with any thing to alarm me Having cautiously examined every thing around me as well by the eye as by the ear and finding all quiet I ventured to cross the fence and pluck from the standing stalks about a dozen good ears of corn with which I stole back to the thicket in safety This corn was of no use to me without fire to roast it and it was equally dangerous to kindle fire by night as by day the light at one time and the smoke at another might betray me to those who I knew were ever ready to pursue and arrest me Hunger eats through stone walls says the proverb and an empty stomach is a petitioner whose solicitations cannot be refused if there is any thing to satisfy them with Having regained the woods in safety I ventured to go as far as the side of a swamp which I knew to be at the distance of two or three hundred yards by the appearance of the timber When in the swamp I felt pretty secure but determined that I would never again attempt to travel in the neighbourhood of a plantation in the daytime When in the swamp a quarter of a mile I collected some dry wood and lighted it with the aid of my tinder-box flint and steel This was the first fire that I kindled on my journey and I was careful to burn none but dry wood to prevent the formation of smoke Here I roasted my corn and ate as much of it as I could After my dinner I lay down and slept for three or four hours When I awoke the sun was scarcely visible through the tree tops It was evening and prudence required me to leave the swamp before dark lest I should not be able to find my way out Approaching the edge of the swamp I watched the going down of the sun and noted the stars as they appeared in the heavens I had long since learned to distinguish the north-star from all the other small luminaries of the night and the seven pointers were familiar to me These heavenly bodies were all the guides I had to direct me on my way and as soon as the night had set in I commenced my march through the woods bearing as nearly due east as I could I took this course for the purpose of getting down the country as far as the road leading from Augusta to Morgan County with the intention of pursuing the route by which I had come out from South Carolina deeming it more safe to travel the high road by night than to attempt to make my way at random over the country guided only by the stars I travelled all night keeping the north-star on my left hand as nearly as I could and passing many plantations taking care to keep at a great distance from the houses I think I travelled at least twenty-five miles to-night without passing any road that appeared so wide or so much beaten as that which I had travelled when I came from South Carolina This night I passed through a peach orchard laden with fine ripe fruit with which I filled my pockets and hat and before day in crossing a corn-field I pulled a supply of roasting-ears with which and my peaches I retired at break of day to a large wood into which I travelled more than a mile before I halted Here in the midst of a thicket of high whortleberry bushes I encamped for the day I made my breakfast upon roasted corn and peaches and then lay down and slept unmolested until after twelve o'clock when I awoke and rose up for the purpose of taking a better view of my quarters but I was scarcely on my feet when I was attacked by a swarm of hornets that issued from a large nest that hung on the limb of a tree within twenty or thirty feet of me I knew that the best means of making peace with my hostile neighbours was to lie down with my face to the ground and this attitude I quickly took not however before I had been stung by several of my assailants which kept humming through the air about me for a long time and prevented me from leaving this spot until after sundown and after they had retired to rest for the night I now commenced the attack on my part and taking a handful of dry leaves approached the nest which was full as large as a half bushel and thrusting the leaves into the hole at the bottom of the nest through which its tenants passed in and out secured the whole garrison prisoners in their own citadel I now cut off the branch upon which the nest hung and threw it with its contents into my evening fire over which I roasted a supply of corn for my night's journey Commencing my march this evening soon after nightfall I travelled until about one o'clock in the morning as nearly as I could estimate the time by the appearance of the stars when I came upon a road which from its width and beaten appearance I took to be the road leading to Augusta and determined to pursue it I travelled on this road until I saw the appearance of daylight when I turned into the woods and went full a mile before I ventured to stop for the day I concealed myself to-day in a thicket of young pine trees that had sprung up round about an old pen of logs which had formerly been used either as a wolf or turkey trap In this retreat nothing disturbed me this day and at dark I again returned to the road which I travelled in silence treading as lightly as possible with my feet and listening most attentively to every sound that I heard After being on the road more than an hour I heard the sound of the feet of horses and immediately stepped aside and took my place behind the trunk of a large tree Within a minute or two several horses with men on them passed me The men were talking to each other and one of them asked another in my hearing if it was not about five miles to the Oconee The reply was too low to be understood by me but I was now satisfied that I was on the high road leading down the country on the Savannah side of Oconee Waiting until these horsemen were out of hearing I followed them at a brisk walk and within less than on hour came to the side of a river the width of which I could not ascertain by reason of the darkness of the night some fog having risen from the water I had no doubt that this stream was the Oconee and as I had heretofore forded that river with a wagon and team I procured a long stick from the shore and entered the river with all my clothes on me except my great coat and pantaloons which I carried on my back The river proved shallow not being more than four feet deep in the deepest part and I had proceeded in safety beyond the middle of the stream when I heard the noise produced by horses' feet in front of me and within two or three minutes several horsemen rode into the river directly before me and advanced towards me I now stooped down into the water so as to leave nothing but my head and the upper part of my pack above its surface and waited the passage of the strangers who after riding into the river until the water washed the bellies of their horses stopped to permit the animals to drink two of them being at this time not more than ten yards from me Here they entered into conversation with each other and one it was his opinion that that fellow had not come this way at all The other then asked what his name was and the first replied that he was called Charles in the advertisement but that he would no doubt call himself by some other name as runaway negroes always took some false name and assumed a false character I now knew that I was within a few feet of a party who were patrolling the country in search of me and that nothing could save me from falling into their hands but the obscurity produced by the fog There were no clouds and if the fog had not been in the air they must have perceived my head on the smooth surface of the water and have known that it was no stump or log of wood After a few minutes of pause these gentlemen all rode on to the side of the river from which I had come and in a short time were out of hearing Notwithstanding they were gone I remained in the water full a quarter of an hour until I was certain that no other persons were moving along the road near me These were the same gentlemen who had passed me early in the night and from whom I learned the distance to the river From these people I had gained intelligence which I considered of much value to me It was now certain that the whole country had been advised of my flight but it was equally certain that no one had any knowledge of the course I had taken nor of the point I was endeavouring to reach To prevent any one from acquiring a knowledge of my route was a primary object with me and I determined from this moment so to regulate my movements as to wrap my very existence in a veil of impenetrable secrecy After leaving the river one or two miles I turned aside from the road and wrung the water from my clothes which were all wet This occupied some time and after being again equipped for my journey I made all haste to gain as much distance this night as possible The fog extended only a few miles from the river and from the top of an eminence which I gained an hour after wringing my clothes the stars were distinctly visible Here I discovered that the road I was travelling bore nearly east and was not likely to take me to the Savannah river for a long time Nevertheless I travelled hard until daylight appeared before me which was my signal for turning into the woods and seeking a place of safety for the day The country in which I now was appeared high and dry without any swamps or low grounds in which an asylum might be found I therefore determined to go to the top of a hill that extended on my right for some distance either way The summit of this ridge was gained before there was enough of daylight to enable me to see objects clearly but as soon as a view of the place could be had I discovered that it was a thicket of pine trees and that the road which I had left led through a plantation that lay within sight the house and other buildings on which appeared to be such as I had before seen but I could not at once recollect where or at what time I had seen them Going to an open space in the thicket from which I could scan the plantation at leisure I became satisfied after the sun had risen and thrown his light upon the earth that this was no other than the residence of the gentleman who had so kindly entertained my master and me as we went to and returned from Savannah with the wagon I now remembered that this gentleman was the friend of my late master and that he had told me to come and see him if ever I passed this way again but I knew that he was a slave-holder and a planter and that when he gave me liberty to visit his plantation he expected that my visits would always be the visits of a slave and not the clandestine calls of a runaway negro It seemed to me that this gentleman was too benevolent a man to arrest and send me back to my cruel mistress and yet how could I expect or even hope that a cotton planter would see a runaway slave on his premises and not cause him to be taken up and sent home Failing to seize a runaway slave when he has him in his power is held to be one of the most dishounorable acts to which a southern planter can subject himself Nor should the people of the north be surprised at this Slaves are regarded in the south as the most precious of all earthly possessions and at the same time as a precarious and hazardous kind of property in the enjoyment of which the master is not safe The planters may well be compared to the inhabitants of a national frontier which is exposed to the inroads of hostile invading tribes Where all are in like danger and subject to like fears it is expected that all will be governed by like sentiments and act upon like principles I stood and looked at the house of this good planter for more than an hour after the sun had risen and saw all the movements which usually take place on a cotton plantation in the morning Long before the sun was up the overseer had proceeded to the field at the head of the hands the black women who attended to the cattle and milked the cows had gone to the cow-pen with their pails and the smoke ascended from the chimney of the kitchen before the doors of the great house were opened or any of the members of the family were seen abroad At length two young ladies opened the door and stood in the freshness of the morning air These were soon joined by a brother and at last I saw the gentleman himself leave the house and walk towards the stables that stood at some distance from the house on my left I think even now that it was a foolish resolution that emboldened me to show myself to this gentleman It was like throwing one's self in the way of a lion who is known sometimes to spare those whom he might destroy but I resolved to go and meet this planter at his stables and tell him my whole story Issuing from the woods I crossed the fields unperceived by the people at the house and going directly to the stables presented myself to then proprietor as he stood looking at a fine horse in one of the yards At first he did not know me and asked me whose man I was I then asked him if he did not remember me and named the time when I had been at his house I then told at once that I was a runaway that my master was dead and my mistress so cruel that I could not live with her not omitting to show the scars on my back and to give a full account of the manner in which they had been made The gentleman stood and looked at me more than a minute without uttering a word and then Charles I will not betray you but you must not stay here It must not be known that you were on this plantation and that I saw and conversed with you However as I suppose you are hungry you may go to the kitchen and get your breakfast with my house servants He then set off for the house and I followed but turning into the kitchen as he ordered me I was soon supplied with a good breakfast of cold meat warm bread and as much new butter-milk as I chose to drink Before I sat down to breakfast the lady of the house came into the kitchen with her two daughters and gave me a dram of peach brandy I drank this brandy and was very thankful for it but I am fully convinced now that it did me much more harm than good and that this part of the kindness of this most excellent family was altogether misplaced Whilst I was taking my breakfast a black man came into the kitchen and gave me a dollar that he his master had sent me at the same time laying on the table before me a package of bread and meat weighing at least ten pounds wrapped up in a cloth On delivering these things the black man told me that his master desired me to quit his premises as soon as I had finished my breakfast This injunction I obeyed and within less than an hour after I entered this truly hospitable house I quitted it forever but not without leaving behind me my holiest blessings upon the heads of its inhabitants It was yet early in the morning when I regained the woods on the opposite side of the plantation from that by which I had entered it XXI I could not believe it possible that the white people whom I had just left would give information of the route I had taken but as it was possible that all who dwelt on this plantation might not be so pure of heart as were they who possessed it I thought it prudent to travel some distance in the woods before I stopped for the day notwithstanding the risk of moving about in the open light For the purpose of precluding the possibility of being betrayed I now determined to quit this road and travel altogether in the woods or through open fields for two or three nights guiding my march by the stars In pursuance of this resolution I bore away to the left of the high road and travelled five or six miles before I stopped going round all the fields that I saw in my way and keeping them at a good distance from me In the afternoon of this day it rained and I had no other shelter than the boughs and leaves of a large magnolia tree but this kept me tolerably dry and as it cleared away in the evening I was able to continue my journey by starlight I have no definite idea of the distance that I travelled in the course of this and the two succeeding nights as I had no road to guide me and was much perplexed by the plantations and houses the latter of which I most carefully eschewed but on the third night after this I encountered a danger which was very nearly fatal to me At the time of which I now speak the moon having changed lately shone until about eleven o'clock I had been on my way two or three hours this evening and all the world seemed to be quiet when I entered a plantation that lay quite across my way In passing through these fields I at last saw the houses and other improvements and about a hundred yards from the house a peach orchard which I could distinguish by the faint light of the moon This orchard was but little out of my way and a quarter of a mile as nearly as I could judge from the woods I resolved to examine these peach trees and see what fruit was on them Coming amongst them I found the fruit of the kind called Indian peaches in Georgia These Indian peaches are much the largest and finest peaches that I have ever seen one of them oftentimes being as large as a common quince I had filled all my pockets and was filling my handkerchief with this delicious fruit which is of deep red when I heard the loud growl of a dog toward the house the roof of which I could see I stood as still as a stone but yet the dog growled on and at length barked out I presume he smelled me for he could not hear me In a short time I found that the dog was coming towards me and I then started and ran as fast as I could for the woods He now barked louder and was followed by another dog both making a terrible noise I was then pretty light of foot and was already close by the woods when the first dog overtook me I carried a good stick in my hand and with this I kept the dogs at bay until I gained the fence and escaped into the woods but now I heard the shouts of men encouraging the dogs both of which were now up with me and the men were coming as fast as they could The dogs would not permit me to run and unless I could make free use of my heels it was clear that I must be taken in a few minutes I now thought of my master's sword which I had not removed from its quilted scabbard in my great coat since I commenced my journey I snatched it from its sheath and at a single cut laid open the head of the largest and fiercest of the dogs from his neck to his nose He gave a loud yell and fell dead on the ground The other dog seeing the fate of his companion leaped the fence and escaped into the field where he stopped and like a cowardly cur set up a clamorous barking at the enemy he was afraid to look in the face I thought this no time to wait to ascertain what the men would say when they came to their dead dog but made the best of my way through the woods and did not stop to look behind me for more than an hour In my battle with the dogs I lost all my peaches except a few that remained in my pockets and in running through the woods I tore my clothes very badly a disaster not easily repaired in my situation but I had proved the solidity of my own judgment in putting up my sword as a part of my travelling equi I now considered it necessary to travel as fast as possible and get as far as I could before day from the late battle-ground and certainly I lost no time but from the occurrences of the next day I am of opinion that I had not continued in a straight line all night but that I must have travelled in a circular or zigzag route When a man is greatly alarmed and in a strange country he is not able to note courses or calculate distances very accurately Daylight made its appearance when I was moving to the south for the daybreak was on my left hand but I immediately stopped went into a thicket of low white oak bushes and lay down to rest myself for I was very weary and soon fell asleep and did not awake until it was ten or eleven o'clock Before I fell asleep I noted the course of the rising sun from the place where I lay in pursuance of a rule that I had established for by this means I could tell the time of day at any hour within a short period of time by taking the bearing of the sun in the heavens from where I lay and then comparing it with the place of his rising When I awoke to-day I felt hungry and after eating my breakfast again lay down but felt an unusual sense of disquietude and alarm It seemed to me that this was not a safe place to lie in although it looked as well as any other spot that I could see I rose and looked for a more secure retreat but not seeing any lay down again--still I was uneasy and could not lie still Finally I determined to get up and remove to the side of a large and long black log that lay at the distance of seventy or eighty yards from me I went to the log and lay down by it placing my bundle under my head with the intention of going to sleep again if I could but I had not been here more than fifteen or twenty minutes when I heard the noise of men's voices and soon after the tramping of horses on the ground I lay with my back to the log in such a position that I could see the place where I had been in the bushes I saw two dogs go into this little thicket and three horsemen rode over the very spot where I had lain when asleep in the morning and immediately horses and voices were at my back around me and over me Two horses jumped over the log by the side of which I lay one about ten feet from my feet and the other within two yards from my head The horses both saw me took fright and started to run but fortunately their riders who were probably looking for me in the tops of the trees or expecting to see me start before them in the woods and run for my life did not see me and attributed the alarm of their horses to the black appearance of the log for I heard one of them say--Our horses are afraid of black logs--I wonder how they would stand the sight of the negro if we should meet him There must have been in the troop at least twenty horsemen and the number of dogs was greater than I could count as they ran in the woods I knew that all these men and dogs were in search of me and that if they could find me I should be hunted down like a wild beast The dogs that had gone into the thicket where I had been fortunately for me had not been trained to hunt negroes in the woods and were probably brought out for the purpose of being trained Doubtless if some of the kept dogs as they are called of which there were certainly several in this large pack had happened to go into that thicket instead of those that did go there my race would soon have been run I lay still by the side of the log for a long time after the horses dogs and men had ceased to trouble the woods with their noise if it can be that a man lies still who is trembling in every joint nerve and muscle like a dog lying upon a cake of ice and when I arose and turned round I found myself so completely bereft of understanding that I could not tell south from north nor east from west I could not even distinguish the thicket of bushes from which I had removed to come to this place from the other bushes of the woods I remained here all day and at night it appeared to me that the sun set in the south-east After sundown the moon appeared to my distempered judgment to stand due north from me and all the stars were out of their places Fortunately I had sense enough remaining to know that it would not be safe for me to attempt to travel until my brain had been restored to its ordinary stability which did not take place until the third morning after my fright The three days that I passed in this place I reckon the most unhappy of my life for surely it is the height of human misery to be oppressed with alienation of mind and to be conscious of the affliction Distracted as I was I had determined never to quit this wood and voluntarily return to slavery and the joy I felt on the third morning when I saw the sun rise in his proper place in the heavens the black log the thicket of bushes and all other things resume the positions in which I found them may be imagined by those who have been saved from apparently hopeless shipwreck on a barren rock in the midst of the ocean but cannot be described by any but a poetic pen I spent this day in making short excursions through the woods for the purpose of ascertaining whether any road was near to me or not and in the afternoon I came to one about a mile from my camp which was broad and had the appearance of being much travelled It appeared to me to lead to the north Awhile before sundown I brought my bundle to this road and lay down quietly to await the approach of night When it was quite dark except the light of the moon which was now brilliant I took to this road and travelled all night without hearing or seeing any person and on the succeeding night about two o'clock in the morning I came to the margin of a river so wide that I could not see across it but the fog was so dense at this time that I could not have seen across a river of very moderate width I procured a long pole and sounded the depth of the water which I found not very deep but as I could not see the opposite shore was afraid to attempt to ford the stream In this dilemma I turned back from the river and went more than a mile to gain the cover of a small wood where I might pass the day in safety and wait a favourable moment for obtaining a view of the river preparatory to crossing it I lay all day in full view of the high road and saw at least a hundred people pass from which I inferred that the country was populous about me In the evening as soon as it was dark I left my retreat and returned to the river side The atmosphere was now clear and the river seemed to be at least a quarter of a mile in width and whilst I was divesting myself of my clothes preparatory to entering the water happening to look down the shore I saw a canoe with its head drawn high on the beach On reaching the canoe I found that it was secured to the trunk of a tree by a lock and chain but after many efforts I broke the lock and launched the canoe into the river The paddles had been removed but with the aid of my sounding-pole I managed to conduct the canoe across the water I was now once more in South Carolina where I knew it was necessary for me to be even more watchful than I had been in Georgia I do not know where I crossed the Savannah river but I think it must have been only a few miles above the town of Augusta After gaining the Carolina shore I took an observation of the rising moon and of such stars as I was acquainted with and hastened to get away from the river from which I knew that heavy fogs rose every night at this season of the year obscuring the heavens for many miles on either side I travelled this night at least twenty miles and provided myself with a supply of corn which was now hard from a field at the side of the road At daybreak I turned into the woods and went to the top of a hill on my left where the ground was overgrown by the species of pine-tree called spruce in the south I here kindled a fire and parched corn for my breakfast In the afternoon of this day the weather became cloudy and before dark the rain fell copiously and continued through the night with the wind high I took shelter under a large stooping tree that was decayed and hollow on the lower side and kept me dry until the morning When daylight appeared I could see that the country around me was well inhabited and that the forest in which I lay was surrounded by plantations at the distance of one or two miles from me I did not consider this a safe position and waited anxiously for night to enable me to change my quarters The weather was foul throughout the day and when night returned it was so dark that I could not see a large tree three feet before me Waiting until the moon rose I made my way back to the road but had not proceeded more than two or three miles on my way when I came to a place where the road forked and the two roads led away almost at right angles from each other It was so cloudy that I could not see the place of the moon in the heavens and I knew not which of these roads to take To go wrong was worse than to stand still and I therefore determined to look out for some spot in which I could hide myself and remain in this neighbourhood until the clearing up of the weather Taking the right hand road I followed its course until I saw at the distance as I computed it in the night of two miles from me a large forest which covered elevated ground I gained it by the shortest route across some cotton fields Going several hundred yards into this wood I attempted to kindle a fire in which I failed every combustible substance being wet This compelled me to pass the night as well as I could amongst the damp bushes and trees that overhung me When day came I went farther into the woods and on the top of the highest ground that I could see established my camp by cutting bushes with my knife and erecting a sort of rude booth It was now by my computation about the twenty-fifth of August and I remained here eleven days without seeing one clear night and in all this time the sun never shone for half a day at once I procured my subsistence while here from a field of corn which I discovered at the distance of a mile and a half from my camp This was the first time that I was weather-bound and my patience had been worn out and renewed repeatedly before the return of the clear weather but one afternoon I perceived the trees to be much agitated by the wind the clouds appeared high and were driven with velocity over my head I saw the clear sky appear in all its beauty in the northwest Before sundown the wind was high the sun shone in full splendour and a few fleecy clouds careering high in the upper vault of heaven gave assurance that the rains were over and gone At nightfall I returned to the forks of the road and after much observation finally concluded to follow the right hand road in which I am satisfied that I committed a great error Nothing worthy of notice occurred for several days after this As I was now in a thickly-peopled country I never moved until long after night and was cautious never to permit daylight to find me on the road but I observed that the north-star was always on my left hand My object was to reach the neighbourhood of Columbia and get upon the road which I had travelled and seen years before in coming to the south but the road I was now on must have been the great Charleston road leading down the country and not across the courses of the rivers So many people travelled this road as well by night as by day that my progress was very slow and in some of the nights I did not travel more than eight miles At the end of a week after leaving the forks I found myself in a flat sandy poor country and as I had not met with any river on this road I now concluded that I was on the way to the sea-board instead of Columbia In my perplexity I resolved to try to get information concerning the country I was in by placing myself in some obscure place in the side of the road and listening to the conversation of travellers as they passed me For this purpose I chose the corner of a cotton field around which the road turned and led along the fence for some distance Passing the day in the woods among the pine-trees I came to this corner in the evening and lying down within the field waited patiently the coming of travellers that I might hear their conversation and endeavour to learn from that which they the name at least of some place in this neighbourhood On the first and second evenings that I lay here I gleaned nothing from the passengers that I thought could be of service to me but on the third night about ten o'clock several wagons drawn by mules passed me and I heard one of the drivers call to another and tell him that it was sixty miles to Charleston and that they should be able to reach the river to-morrow I could not at first imagine what river this could be but another of the wagoners enquired how far it was to the Edisto to which it was replied by some one that it was near thirty miles I now perceived that I had mistaken my course and was as completely lost as a wild goose in cloudy weather Not knowing what to do I retraced the road that had led me to this place for several nights hoping that something would happen from which I might learn the route to Columbia but I gained no information that could avail me anything At length I determined to quit this road altogether travel by the north-star for two or three weeks and after that to trust to Providence to guide me to some road that might lead me back to Maryland Having turned my face due north I made my way pretty well for the first night but on the second the fog was so dense that no stars could be seen This compelled me to remain in my camp which I had pitched in a swamp In this place I remained more than a week waiting for clear nights but now the equinoctial storm came on and raged with a fury which I had never before witnessed in this annual gale at least it had never before appeared so violent to me because perhaps I had never been exposed to its blasts without the shelter of a house of some kind This storm continued four days and no wolf ever lay closer in his lair or moved out with more stealthy caution than I did during this time My subsistence was drawn from a small corn-field at the edge of the swamp in which I lay After the storm was over the weather became calm and clear and I fell into a road which appeared to run nearly north-west Following the course of this road by short marches because I was obliged to start late at night and stop before day I came on the first day or rather night of October by my calender to a broad and well-frequented road that crossed mine at nearly right angles These roads crossed in the middle of a plantation and I took to the right hand along this great road and pursued it in the same cautious and slow manner that I had travelled for the last month When the day came I took refuge in the woods as usual choosing the highest piece of ground that I could find in the neighbourhood No part of this country was very high but I thought people who visited these woods would be less inclined to walk to the tops of the hills than to keep their course along the low grounds I had lately crossed many small streams but on the second night of my journey on this road came to a narrow but deep river and after the most careful search no boat or craft of any kind could be found on my side A large flat with two or three canoes lay on the opposite side but they were as much out of my reach as if they had never been made There was no alternative but swimming this stream and I made the transit in less than three minutes carrying my packages on my back I had as yet fallen in with no considerable towns and whenever I had seen a house near the road or one of the small hamlets of the south in my way I had gone round by the woods or fields so as to avoid the inhabitants but on the fourth night after swimming the small river I came in sight of a considerable village with lights burning and shining through many of the windows I knew the danger of passing a town on account of the patrols with which all southern towns are provided and making a long circuit to the right so as totally to avoid this village I came to the banks of a broad river which upon further examination I found flowing past the village and near its border This compelled me to go back and attempt to turn the village on the left which was performed by wandering a long time in swamps and pine woods It was break of day when I regained the road beyond the village and returning to the swamps from which I had first issued I passed the day under their cover On the following night after regaining the road I soon found myself in a country almost entirely clear of timber and abounding in fields of cotton and corn The houses were numerous and the barking of dogs was incessant I felt that I was in the midst of dangers and that I was entering a region very different from those tracts of country though which I had lately passed where the gloom of the wilderness was only broken by solitary plantations or lonely huts I had no doubt that I was in the neighbourhood of some town but of its name and the part of the country in which it was located I was ignorant I at length found that I was receding from the woods altogether and entering a champaign country in the midst of which I now perceived a town of considerable magnitude the inhabitants of which were entirely silent and the town itself presented the appearance of total solitude The country around was so open that I despaired of turning so large a place as this was and again finding the road I travelled I therefore determined to risk all consequences and attempt to pass this town under cover of darkness Keeping straight forward I came unexpectedly to a broad river which I now saw running between me and the town I took it for granted that there must be a ferry at this place and on examining the shore found several small boats fastened only with ropes to a large scow One of these boats I seized and was quickly on the opposite shore of the river I entered the village and proceeded to its centre without seeing so much as a rat in motion Finding myself in an open space I stopped to examine the streets and upon looking at the houses around me I at once recognized the jail of Columbia and the tavern in which I had lodged on the night after I was sold This discovery made me feel almost at home with my wife and children I remembered the streets by which I had come from the country to the jail and was quickly at the extremity of the town marching towards the residence of the paltry planter at whose house I had lodged on my way south It was late at night when I left Columbia and it was necessary for me to make all speed and get as far as possible from that place before day I ran rather than walked until the appearance of dawn when I left the road and took shelter in the pine woods with which this part of the country abounds I had now been travelling almost two months and was still so near the place from which I first departed that I could easily have walked to it in a week by daylight but I hoped that as I was now on a road with which I was acquainted and in a country through which I had travelled before that my future progress would be more rapid and that I should be able to surmount without difficulty many of the obstacles that had hitherto embarrassed me so greatly It was now in my power to avail myself of the knowledge I had formerly acquired of the customs of South Carolina The patrol are very rigid in the execution of the authority with which they are invested but I never had much difficulty with these officers anywhere From dark until ten or eleven o'clock at night the patrol are watchful and always traversing the country in quest of negroes but towards midnight these gentlemen grow cold or sleepy or weary and generally betake themselves to some house where they can procure a comfortable fire I now established as a rule of my future conduct to remain in my hiding place until after ten o'clock according to my computation of time and this night I did not come to the road until I supposed it to be within an hour of midnight and it was well for me that I practised so much caution for when within two or three hundred yards of the road I heard people conversing After standing some minutes in the woods and listening to the voices at the road the people separated and a party took each end of the road and galloped away upon their horses These people were certainly a band of patrollers who were watching this road and had just separated to return home for the night After the horsemen were quite out of hearing I came to the road and walked as fast as I could for hours and again came into the lane leading to the house where I had first remained a few days in Carolina Turning away from the road I passed through this plantation near the old cotton-gin house in which I had formerly lodged and perceived that every thing on this plantation was nearly as it was when I left it Two or three miles from this place I again left the road and sought a place of concealment and from this time until I reached Maryland I never remained in the road until daylight but once and I paid dearly then for my temerity I was now in an open thickly-peopled country in comparison with many other tracts through which I had passed and this circumstance compelled me to observe the greater caution As nearly as possible I confined my travelling within the hours of midnight and three o'clock in the morning Parties of patrollers were heard by me almost every morning before day These people sometimes moved directly along the roads but more frequently lay in wait near the side of the road ready to pounce upon any runaway slave that might chance to pass but I knew by former experience that they never lay out all night except in times of apprehended danger and the country appearing at this time to be quiet I felt but little apprehension of falling in with these policemen within my travelling hours There was now plenty of corn in the fields and sweet potatoes had not yet been dug There was no scarcity of provisions with me and my health was good and my strength unimpaired For more than two weeks I pursued the road that had led me from Columbia believing I was on my way to Camden Many small streams crossed my way but none of them were large enough to oblige me to swim in crossing them XXII On the twenty-fourth of October according to my computation in a dark night I came to a river which appeared to be both broad and deep Sounding its depth with a pole I found it too deep to be forded and after the most careful search along the shore no boat could be discovered This place appeared altogether strange to me and I began to fear that I was again lost Confident that I had never before been where I now found myself and ignorant of the other side of the stream I thought it best not to attempt to cross this water until I was better informed of the country through which it flowed A thick wood bordered the road on my left and gave me shelter until daylight Ascending a tree at sunrise that overlooked the stream which appeared to be more than a mile in width I perceived on the opposite shore a house and one large and several small boats in the river I remained in this tree the greater part of the day and saw several persons cross the river some of whom had horses but in the evening the boats were all taken back to the place at which I had seen them in the morning The river was so broad that I felt some fear of failing in the attempt to swim it but seeing no prospect of procuring a boat to transport me I resolved to attempt the navigation as soon as it was dark About nine o'clock at night having equipped myself in the best manner I was able I undertook this hazardous navigation and succeeded in gaining the farther shore of the river in about an hour with all my things in safety On the previous day I had noted the bearing of the road as it led from the river and in the middle of the night I again resumed my journey in a state of perplexity bordering upon desperation for it was now evident that this was not the road by which we had travelled when we came to the southern country and on which hand to turn to reach the right way I knew not After travelling five or six miles on this road and having the north-star in view all the time I became satisfied that my course lay northwest and that I was consequently going out of my way and to heighten my anxiety I had not tasted any animal food since I crossed the Savannah river--a sensation of hunger harrassed me constantly but fortune which had been so long adverse to me and had led me so often astray had now a little favour in store for me The leaves were already fallen from some of the more tender trees and near the road I this night perceived a persimmon tree well laden with fruit and whilst gathering the fallen persimmons under the tree a noise over head arrested my attention This noise was caused by a large opossum which was on the tree gathering fruit like myself With a long stick the animal was brought to the ground and it proved to be very fat weighing at least ten pounds With such a luxury as this in my possession I could not think of travelling far without tasting it and accordingly halted about a mile from the persimmon tree on a rising ground in a thick wood where I killed my opossum and took off its skin a circumstance that I much regretted for with the skin I took at least a pound of fine fat Had I possessed the means of scalding my game and dressing it like a pig it would have afforded me provision for a week but as it was I made a large fire and roasted my prize before it losing all the oil that ran out in the operation for want of a dripping-pan to catch it It was daylight when my meat was ready for the table and a very sumptuous breakfast it yielded me Since leaving Columbia I had followed as nearly as the course of the roads permitted the index of the north-star which I supposed would lead me on the most direct route to Maryland but I now became convinced that this star was leading me away from the line by which I had approached the cotton country I slept none this day but passed the whole time from breakfast until night in considering the means of regaining my lost way From the aspect of the country I arrived at the conclusion that I was not near the sea-coast for there were no swamps in all this region the land lay rather high and rolling and oak timber abounded At the return of night I resumed my journey earlier than usual paying no regard to the roads but keeping the north-star on my left hand as nearly as I could This night I killed a rabbit which had leaped from the bushes before me by throwing my walking stick at it It was roasted at my stopping place in the morning and was very good I pursued the same course keeping the north-star on my left hand for three nights intending to get as far east as the road leading from Columbia to Richmond in Virginia but as my line of march lay almost continually in the woods I made but little progress and on the third day the weather became cloudy so that I could not see the stars This again compelled me to lie by until the return of fair weather On the second day after I had stopped this time the sun shone out bright in the morning and continued to shed a glorious light during the day but in the evening the heavens became overcast with clouds and the night that followed was so dark that I did not attempt to travel This state of the weather continued more than a week obliging me to remain stationary all this time These cloudy nights were succeeded by a brisk wind from the north-west accompanied by fine clear nights in which I made the best of my way towards the north-east pursuing my course across the country without regard to roads forests or streams of water crossing many of the latter none of which were deep but some of them were extremely muddy One night I became entangled in a thick and deep swamp the trees that grew in which were so tall and stood so close together that the interlocking of their boughs and the deep foliage in which the were clad prevented me from seeing the stars Wandering there for several hours most of the time with mud and water over my knees and frequently wading in stagnant pools with deep slimy bottoms I became totally lost and was incapable of seeing the least appearance of fast land At length giving up all hope of extricating from this abyss of mud water brambles and fallen timber I scrambled on a large tussock and sat down to await the coming of day with the intention of going to the nearest high land as soon as the sun should be up The nights were now becoming cool and though I did not see any frost in the swamp where I was in the morning I have no doubt that hoar frost was seen in the dry and open country After daylight I found myself as much perplexed as I was at midnight No shore was to be seen and in every direction there was the same deep dreary black solitude To add to my misfortune the morning proved cloudly and when the sun was up I could not tell the east from the west After waiting several hours for a sight of the sun and failing to obtain it I set out in search of a running stream of water intending to strike off at right angels with the course of the current and endeavour to reach the dry ground by this means but after wandering about through tangled bushes briars and vines clambering over fallen tree-tops and wading through fens overgrown with saw grass for two or three hours I sat down in despair of finding any guide to conduct me from this detestable place My bag of meal that I took with me at the commencement of my journey was long since gone and the only provisions that I now possessed were a few grains of parched corn and near a pint of chestnuts that I had picked up under a tree the day before I entered the swamp The chestnut-tree was full of nuts but I was afraid to throw sticks or to shake the tree lest hunters or other persons hearing the noise might be drawn to the place About ten o'clock I sat down under a large cypress tree upon a decaying log of the same timber to make my breakfast on a few grains of parched corn Near me was an open space without trees but filled with water that seemed to be deep for no grass grew in it except a small quantity near the shore The water was on my left hand and as I sat cracking my corn my attention was attracted by the playful gambols of two squirrels that were running and chasing each other on the boughs of some trees near me Half pleased with the joyous movements of the little animals and half covetous of their carcasses to roast and devour them I paid no attention to a succession of sounds on my left which I thought proceeded from the movement of frogs at the edge of the water until the breaking of a stick near me caused me to turn my head when I discovered that I had other neighbours than spring-frogs A monstrous alligator had left the water and was crawling over the mud with his eyes fixed upon me He was now within fifteen feet of me and in a moment more if he had not broken the stick with his weight I should have become his prey He could easily have knocked me down with a blow of his tail and if his jaws had once been closed on a leg or an arm he would have dragged me into the water spite of any resistance that I could have made At the sight of him I sprang to my feet and running to the other end of the fallen tree on which I sat and being there out of danger had an opportunity of viewing the motions of the alligator at leisure Finding me out of his reach he raised his trunk from the ground elevated his snout and gave a wistful look the import of which I well understood then turning slowly round he retreated to the water and sank from my vision I was much alarmed by this adventure with the alligator for had I fallen in with this huge reptile in the night-time I should have had no chance of escape from his tusks The whole day was spent in the swamp not in travelling from place to place but in waking for the sun to shine to enable me to obtain a knowledge of the various points of the heavens The day was succeeded by a night of unbroken darkness and it was late in the evening of the second day before I saw the sun It being then too late to attempt to extricate myself from the swamp for that day I was obliged to pass another night in the lodge that I had formed for myself in the thick boughs of a fallen cypress tree which elevated me several feet from the ground where I believed the alligator could not reach me if he should come in pursuit of me On the morning of the third day the sun rose beautifully clear and at sight of him I set off for the east It must have been five miles from the place where I lay to the dry land on the east of the swamp for with all the exertion that fear and hunger compelled me to make it was two or three o'clock in the afternoon when I reached the shore after swimming in several places and suffering the loss of a very valuable part of my clothes which were torn off by the briars and snags On coming to high ground I found myself in the woods and hungry as I was lay down to await the coming of night lest some one should see me moving through the forest in daylight When night came on I resumed my journey by the stars which were visible and marched several miles before coming to a plantation The first that I came to was a cotton field and after much search I found no corn nor grain of any kind on this place and was compelled to continue on my way Two or three miles further on I was more fortunate and found a field of corn which had been gathered from the stalks and thrown in heaps along the ground Filling my little bag which I still kept with this corn I retreated a mile or two in the woods and striking fire encamped for the purpose of parching and eating it After despatching my meal I lay down beside the fire and fell into a sound sleep from which I did not awake until long after sunrise but on rising and looking around me I found that my lodge was within less than a hundred yards of a new house that people were building in the woods and upon which men were now at work Dropping instantly to the ground I crawled away through the woods until being out of sight of the house I ventured to rise and escape on my feet After I lay down in the night my fire had died away and emitted no smoke this circumstance saved me This affair made me more cautious as to my future conduct Hiding in the woods until night again came on I continued my course eastward and some time after midnight came upon a wide well beaten road one end of which led at this place a little to the left of the north-star which I could plainly see Here I deliberated a long time whether to take this road or continue my course across the country by the stars but at last resolved to follow the road more from a desire to get out of the woods than from a conviction that it would lead me in the right way In the course of this night I saw but few plantations but was so fortunate as to see a ground-hog crossing the road before me This animal I killed with my stick and carried it until morning At the approach of daylight turning away to the right I gained the top of an eminence from which I could see through the woods for some distance around me Here I kindled a fire and roasted my ground-hog which afforded me a most grateful repast after my late fasting and severe toils According to custom my meal being over I betook myself to sleep and did not awake until the afternoon when descending a few rods down the hill and standing still to take a survey of the woods around me I saw at the distance of half a mile from me a man moving slowly about in the forest and apparently watching like myself to see if any one was in view Looking at this man attentively I saw that he was a black and that he did not move more than a few rods from the same spot where I first saw him Curiosity impelled me to know more of the condition of my neighbour and descending quite to the foot of the hill I perceived that he had a covert of boughs of trees under which I saw him pass and after some time return again from his retreat Examining the appearance of things carefully I became satisfied that the stranger was like myself a negro slave and I determined without more ceremony to go and speak to him for I felt no fear of being betrayed by one as badly off in the world as myself When this man first saw me at the distance of a hundred yards from him he manifested great agitation and at once seemed disposed to run from me but when I called to him and told him not to be afraid he became more assured and waited for me to come close to him I found him to be a dark mulatto small and slender in person and lame in one leg He had been well bred and possessed good manners and fine address I told him I was travelling and presumed this was not his dwelling place Upon which he informed me that he was a native of Kent county in the state of Delaware and had been brought up as a house-servant by his master who on his death-bed had made his will and directed him to be set free by his executors at the age of twenty-five and that in the meantime he would be hired out as a servant to some person who should treat him well Soon after the death of his master the executors hired him to a man in Wilmington who employed him as a waiter in his house for three or four months and then took him to a small town called Newport and sold him to a man who took him immediately to Baltimore where he was again sold or transferred to another man who brought him to South Carolina and sold him to a cotton planter with whom he had lived more than two years and had run away three weeks before the time I saw him with the intention of returning to Delaware That being lame and becoming fatigued by travelling he had stopped here and made this shelter of boughs and bark of trees under which he had remained more than a week before I met him He invited me to go into his camp as he termed it where he had an old skillet more than a bushel of potatoes and several fowls all of which he he had purloined from the plantations in the neighbourhood This encampment was in a level open wood and it appeared surprising to me that its occupant had not been discovered and conveyed back to his master before this time I told him that I thought he ran great risk of being taken up by remaining here and advised him to break up his lodge immediately and pursue his journey travelling only in the night time He then proposed to join me and travel in company with me but this I declined because of his lameness and great want of discretion though I did not assign these reasons to him I remained with this man two or three hours and ate dinner of fowls dressed after his rude fashion Before leaving him I pressed upon him the necessity of immediately quitting the position he then occupied but he he intended to remain there a few days longer unless I would take him with me On quitting my new acquaintance I thought it prudent to change my place of abode for the residue of this day and removed along the top of the hill that I occupied at least two miles and concealed myself in a thicket until night when returning to the road I had left in the morning and travelling hard all night I came to a large stream of water just at the break of day As it was too late to pass the river with safety this morning at this ford I went half a mile higher and swam across the stream in open daylight at a place where both sides of the water were skirted with woods I had several large potatoes that had been given to me by the man at his camp in the woods and these constituted my rations for this day At the rising and setting of the sun I took the bearing of the road by the course of the stream I that I had crossed and found that I was travelling to the northwest instead of the north or northeast to one of which latter points I wished to direct my march Having perceived the country in which I now was to be thickly peopled I remained in my resting place until late at night when returning to the road and crossing it I took once more to the woods with the stars for my guides and steered for the northeast This was a fortunate night for me in all respects The atmosphere was clear the ground was high dry and free from thickets In the course of the night I passed several corn fields with the corn still remaining in them and passed a potato lot in which large quantities of fine potatoes were dug out of the ground and lay in heaps covered with vines but my most signal good luck occurred just before day when passing under a dog-wood tree and hearing a noise in the branches above me I looked up and saw a large opossum amongst the berries that hung upon the boughs The game was quickly shaken down and turned out as fat as a well-fed pig and as heavy as a full-grown rackoon My attention was now turned to searching for a place in which I could secrete myself for the day and dress my provisions in quietness This day was dear and beautiful until the afternoon when the air became damp and the heavens were overhung with clouds The night that followed was dark as pitch compelling me to remain in my camp all night The next day brought with it a terrible storm of rain and wind that continued with but little intermission more than twenty- four hours and the sun was not again visible until the third day nor was there a clear night for more than a week During all this time I lay in my camp and subsisted upon the provisions that I had brought with me to this place The corn and potatoes looked so tempting when I saw them in the fields that I had taken more than I should have consumed had not the bad weather compelled me to remain at this spot but it was well for me for this time that I had taken more than I could eat in one or two days At the end of the cloudy weather I felt much refreshed and strengthened and resumed my journey in high spirits although I now began to feel the want of shoes--those which I wore when I left my mistress having long since been worn out and my boots were now beginning to fail so much that I was obliged to wrap straps of hickory bark about my feet to keep the leather from separating and falling to pieces It was now by my computation the month of November and I was yet in the state of South Carolina I began to consider with myself whether I had gamed or lost by attempting to travel on the roads and after revolving in my mind all the disasters that had befallen me determined to abandon the roads altogether for two reasons-- the first of which was that on the highways I was constantly liable to meet persons or to be overtaken by them and a second no less powerful was that as I did not know what roads to pursue I was oftener travelling on the wrong route than on the right one Setting my face once more for the north-star I advanced with a steady though slow pace for four or five nights when I was again delayed by dark weather and forced to remain in idleness nearly two weeks and when the weather again became clear I was arrested on the second night by a broad and rapid river that appeared so formidable that I did not dare to attempt its passage until after examining it in daylight On the succeeding night however I crossed it by swimming--resting at some large rocks near the middle After gaining the north side of this river which I believed to be the Catawba I considered myself in North Carolina and again steered towards the north XXIII The month of November is in all years a season of clouds and vapours but at the time of which I write the good weather vanished early in the month and all the clouds of the universe seemed to have collected in North Carolina From the second night after crossing the Catawba I did not see the north-star for the space of three weeks and during all this time no progress was made in my journey although I seldom remained two days in the same place but moved from one position to another for the purpose of eluding the observation of the people of the country whose attention might have been attracted by the continual appearance of the smoke of my fires in one place There had as yet been no hard frost and the leaves were still on the oak trees at the close of this cloudy weather but the northwest wind which dispelled the mist also brought down nearly all the leaves of the forest except those of the evergreen trees and the nights now became clear and the air keen with frost Hitherto the oak woods had afforded me the safest shelter but now I was obliged to seek for groves of young pines to retire to at dawn Heretofore I had found a plentiful subsistence in every corn-field and potato-lot that fell in my way but now began to find some of the fields in which corn had grown destitute of the corn and containing nothing but the stalks The potatoes had all been taken out of the lots where they grew except in some few instances where they had been buried in the field and the means of subsistence became every day more difficult to be obtained but as I had fine weather I made the best use of those hours in which I dared to travel and was constantly moving from a short time after dark until daylight The toil that I underwent for the first half of the month of December was excessive and my sufferings for want of food were great I was obliged to carry with me a stock of corn sufficient to supply me for two or three days for it frequently happened that I met with none in the fields for a long time In the course of this period I crossed innumerable streams the greater portion of which were of small size but some were of considerable magnitude and in all of them the water had become almost as cold as ice Sometimes I was fortunate enough to find boats or canoes tied at the side of the streams and when this happened I always made free use of that which no one else was using at the time but this did not occur often and I believe that in these two weeks I swam over nine rivers or streams so deep that I could not ford them The number of creeks and rivulets through which I waded was far greater but I cannot now fix the number In one of these fine nights passing near the house of a planter I saw several dry hides hanging on poles under a shed One of these hides I appropriated to myself for the purpose of converting it into moccasins to supply the place of my boots which were totally worthless By beating the dry hide with a stick it was made sufficiently pliable to bear making it into moccasins of which I made for myself three pair wearing one and carrying the others on my back One day as I lay in a pine thicket several pigs which appeared to be wild having no marks on their ears came near me and one of them approached so close without seeing me that I knocked it down with a stone and succeeded in killing it This pig was very fat and would have weighed thirty if not forty pounds Feeling now greatly exhausted with the fatigues that I had lately undergone and being in a very great forest far removed from white inhabitants I resolved to remain a few days in this place to regale myself with the flesh of the pig which I preserved by hanging it up in the shade after cutting it into pieces Fortune so adverse to me heretofore seemed to have been more kind to me at this time for the very night succeeding the day on which I killed the pig a storm of hail snow and sleet came on and continued fifteen or sixteen hours The snow lay on the ground four inches in depth and the whole country was covered with a crust almost hard enough to bear a man In this state of the weather I could not travel and my stock of pork was invaluable to me The pork was frozen where it hung on the branches of the trees and was as well preserved as if it had been buried in snow but on the fourth day after the snow fell the atmosphere underwent a great change The wind blew from the south the snow melted away the air became warm and the sun shone with the brightness and almost with the warmth of spring It was manifest that my pork which was now soft and oily would not long be in a sound state If I remained here my provisions would become putrid on my hands in a short time and compel me to quit my residence to avoid the atmosphere of the place I resolved to pursue my journey and prepared myself by roasting before the fire all my pork that was left wrapping it up carefully in green pine leaves and enveloping the whole in a sort of close basket that I made of small boughs of trees Equipping myself for my journey with my meat in my knapsack I again took to the woods with the stars for my guide keeping the north-star over my left eye The weather had now become exceedingly variable and I was seldom able to travel more than half of the night The fields were muddy the low grounds in the woods were wet and often covered with water through which I was obliged to wade--the air was damp and cold by day the nights were frosty very often covering the water with ice an inch in thickness From the great degree of cold that prevailed I inferred either that I was pretty far north or that I had advanced too much to the left and was approaching the mountain country To satisfy myself as far as possible of my situation one fair day when the sky was very clear I climbed to the top of a pine-tree that stood on the summit of a hill and took a wide survey of the region around me Eastward I saw nothing but a continuation of plantations intervened by forests on the south the faint beams of a winter sun shed a soft lustre over the woods which were dotted at remote distances with the habitations of men and the openings that they had made in the green champion of the endless pine-groves that nature had planted in the direction of the midday sun On the north at a great distance I saw a tract of low and flat country which in my opinion was the vale of some great river and beyond this at the farthest stretch of vision the eye was lost in the blue transparent vault where the extremity of the arch of the world touches the abode of perpetual winter Turning westward the view passed beyond the region of pine-trees which was followed afar off by naked and leafless oaks hickories and walnuts and still beyond these rose high in air elevated tracts of country clad in the white livery of snow and bearing the impress of mid-winter It was now apparent that I had borne too far west and was within a few days travel of the mountains Descending from my observations I determined on the return of night to shape my course for the future nearly due east until I should at least be out of the mountains According to my calendar it was the day before Christmas that I ascended the pine-tree and I believe I was at that time in the north-western part of North Carolina not far from the banks of the Yadkin river On the following night I travelled from dark until as I supposed about three or four o'clock in the morning when I came to a road which led as I thought in an easterly direction This road I travelled until daylight and encamped near it in an old field overgrown with young pines and holly-trees This was Christmas-day and I celebrated it by breakfasting on fat pork without salt and substituted parched corn for bread In the evening the weather became cloudy and cold and when night came it was so dark that I found difficulty in keeping in the road at some points where it made short angles Before midnight it began to snow and at break of day the snow lay more than a foot deep This compelled me to seek winter quarters and fortunately at about half a mile from the road I found on the side of a steep hill a shelving rock that formed a dry covert with a southern prospect Under this rock I took refuge and kindling a fire of dry sticks considered myself happy to possess a few pounds of my roasted pork and more than half a gallon of corn that I carried in my pockets The snow continued falling until it was full two feet deep around me and the danger of exposing myself to discovery by my tracks in the snow compelled me to keep close to my hiding place until the third day when I ventured to go back to the road which I found broken by the passage of numerous wagons sleds and horses and so much beaten that I could travel it with ease at night the snow affording good light Accordingly at night I again advanced on my way which indeed I was obliged to do for my corn was quite gone and not more than a pound of my pork remained to me I travelled hard through the night and after the morning star rose came to a river which I think must have been the Yadkin It appeared to be about two hundred yards wide and the water ran with great rapidity in it Waiting until the eastern horizon was tinged with the first rays of the morning light I entered the river at the ford and waded until the water was nearly three feet deep when it felt as if it was cutting the flesh from the bones of my limbs and a large cake of ice floating downward forced me off my balance and I was near falling My courage failed me and I returned to the shore but found the pain that already tormented me greatly increased when I was out of the water and exposed to the action of the open air Returning to the river I plunged into the current to relieve me from the pinching frost that gnawed every part of my skin that had become wet and rushing forward as fast as the weight of the water that pressed me downward would permit was soon up to my chin in melted ice when rising to the surface I exerted my utmost strength and skill to gain the opposite shore by swimming in the shortest space of time At every stroke of my arms and legs they were cut and bruised by cakes of solid ice or weighed down by floating masses of congealed snow It is impossible for human life to be long sustained in such an element as that which encompassed me and I had not been afloat five minutes before felt chilled in all my members and in less than the double of that time my limbs felt numbed and my hands became stiff and almost powerless When at the distance of thirty feet front the shore my body was struck by a violent current produced by a projecting rock above me and driven with resistless violence down the stream Wholly unable to contend with the fury of the waves and penetrated by the coldness of death in my most vitals I gave myself up for lost and was commending my soul to God whom I expected to be my immediate judge when I perceived the long hanging branch of a large tree sweeping to and fro and undulating backward and forward as its extremities were washed by the surging current of the river just below me In a moment I was in contact with the tree and making the effort of despair seized one of its limbs Bowed down by the weight of my body the branch yielded to the power of the water which rushing against my person swept me round like the quadrant of a circle and dashed me against the shore where clinging to some roots that grew near the bank the limb of the tree left me and springing with elastic force to its former position again dipped its slender branches in the mad stream Crawling out of the water and being once more on dry land I found my circumstances little less desperate than when I was struggling with the floating ice The morning was frosty and icicles hung in long pendant groups from the trees along the shore of the river and the hoar frost glistened in sparkling radiance upon the polished surface of the smooth snow as it whitened all the plain before me and spread its chill but beautiful covering through the woods There were three alternatives before me one of which I knew must quickly be adopted The one was to obtain a fire by which I could dry and warm my stiffened limbs the second was to die without the fire the third to go to the first house if I could reach one and surrender myself as a runaway slave Staggering rather than walking forward until I gained the cover of a wood at a short distance from the river I turned into it and found that a field bordered the wood within less than twenty rods of the road Within a few yards of this fence I stopped and taking out my fire apparatus to my unspeakable joy found them dry and in perfect safety With the aid of my spunk and some dry moss gathered from the fence a small flame was obtained to which dry leaves being added from the boughs of a white oak tree that had fallen before the frost of the last autumn had commenced I soon had fire of sufficient intensity to consume dry wood with which I supplied it partly from the fence and partly from the branches of the fallen tree Having raked away the snow from about the fire by the time the sun was up my frozen clothes were smoking before the coals--warming first one side and then the other-- I felt the glow of returning life once more invigorating my blood and giving animation to my frozen limbs The public road was near me on one hand and an enclosed field was before me on the other but in my present condition it was impossible for me to leave this place to-day without danger of perishing in the woods or of being arrested on the road As evening came on the air became much colder than it was in the forenoon and after night the wind rose high and blew from the northwest with intense keenness My limbs were yet stiff from the effects of my morning adventure and to complete my distress I was totally without provisions having left a few ears of corn that I had in my pocket on the other side of the river Leaving my fire in the night and advancing into the field near me I discovered a house at some distance and as there was no light or sign of fire about it I determined to reconnoitre the premises which turned out to be a small barn standing alone with no other inhabitants about it than a few cattle and a flock of sheep After much trouble I succeeded in entering the barn by starting the nails that confined one of the boards at the corner Entering the house I found it nearly filled with corn in the husks and some from which the husks had been removed was lying in a heap in one corner Into these husks I crawled and covering myself deeply under them soon became warm and fell into a profound sleep from which I was awakened by the noise of people walking about in the barn and talking of the cattle and sheep which it appeared they had come to feed for they soon commenced working in the corn husks with which I was covered and throwing them out to the cattle I expected at every moment that they would uncover me but fortunately before they saw me they ceased their operations and went to work some husking corn and throwing the husks on the pile over me while others were employed in loading the husked corn into carts as I learned by their conversation and hauling it away to the house The people continued working in the barn all day and in the evening gave more husks to the cattle and went home Waiting two or three hours after my visiters were gone I rose from the pile of husks and filling my pockets with ears of corn issued from the barn at the same place by which I had entered it and retired to the woods where I kindled a fire in a pine thicket and parched more than half a gallon of corn Before day I returned to the barn and again secreted myself in the corn husks In the morning the people again returned to their work and husked corn until the evening At night I again repaired to the woods and parched more corn In this manner I passed more than a month lying in the barn all day and going to the woods at night but at length the corn was all husked and I watched daily the progress that was made in feeding the cattle with the husks knowing that I must quit my winter retreat before the husks were exhausted Before the husked corn was removed from the barn I had conveyed several bushels of the ears into the husks near my bed and concealed them for my winter's stock Whilst I lay in this barn there were frequent and great changes of weather The snow that covered the earth to the depth of two feet when I came here did not remain more than ten days and was succeeded by more than a week of warm rainy weather which was in turn succeeded by several days of dry weather with cold high winds from the north The month of February was cloudy and damp with several squalls of snow and frequent rains About the first of March the atmosphere became clear and dry and the winds boisterous from the west On the third of this month having filled my little bag and all my pockets with parched corn I quitted my winter quarters about ten o'clock at night and again proceeded on my way to the north leaving a large heap of corn husks still lying in the corner of the barn On leaving this place I again pursued the road that had led me to it for several nights crossing many small streams in my way all of which I was able to pass without swimming though several of them were so deep that they wet me as high as my arm-pits This road led nearly northeast and was the only road that I had fallen in with since I left Georgia that had maintained that direction for so great a distance Nothing extraordinary befell me until the twelfth of March when venturing to turn out earlier than usual in the evening and proceeding along the road I found that my way led me down a hill along the side of which the road had been cut into the earth ten or twelve feet in depth having steep banks on each side which were now so damp and slippery that it was impossible for a man to ascend either the one or the other Whilst in this narrow place I heard the sound of horses proceeding up the hill to meet me Stopping to listen in a moment almost two horsemen were close before me trotting up the road To escape on either hand was impossible and to retreat backwards would have exposed me to certain destruction Only one means of salvation was left and I embraced it Near the place where I stood was a deep gully cut in one side of the road by the water which had run down here in time of rains Into this gully I threw myself and lying down close to the ground the horsemen rode almost over me and passed on When they were gone I arose and descending the hill found a river before me In crossing this stream I was compelled to swim at least two hundred yards and found the cold so oppressive after coming out of the water that I was forced to stop at the first thick woods that I could find and make a fire to city myself I did not move again until the next night and on the fourth night after this came to a great river which I suppose was the Roanoke I was obliged to swim this stream and was carried a great way down by the rapidity of the current It must have been more than an hour from the time that I entered the water until I reached the opposite shore and as the rivers were yet very cold I suffered greatly at this place Judging by the aspect of the country I believed myself to be at this time in Virginia and was now reduced to the utmost extremity for want of provisions The corn that I had parched at the barn and brought with me was nearly exhausted and no more was to be obtained in the fields at this season of the year For three or four days I allowed myself only my two hands full of parched corn per day after this I travelled three days without tasting food of any kind but being nearly exhausted with hunger I one night entered an old stack-yard hoping that I might fall in with pigs or poultry of some kind I found instead of these a stack of oats which had not been threshed From this stack I took as much oats in the sheaf as I could carry and going on a few miles stopped in a pine forest made a large fire and parched at least half a gallon of oats after rubbing the grain from the straw After the grain was parched I again rubbed it in my hands to separate it from the husks and spent the night in feasting on parched oats The weather was now becoming quite warm though the water was cold in the rivers and I perceived the farmers had everywhere ploughed their fields preparatory to planting corn Every night I saw people burning brush in the new grounds that they were clearing of the wood and brush and when the day came in the morning after I obtained the oats I perceived people planting corn in a field about half a mile from my fire According to my computation of time it was on the night of the last day of March that I obtained the oats and the appearance of the country satisfied me that I had not lost many days in my reckoning I lay in this pine-wood two days for the purpose of recruiting my strength after my long fast and when I again resumed my journey determined to seek some large road leading towards the north and follow it in future the one that I had been pursuing of late not appearing to be a principal high-way of the country For this purpose striking off across the fields in an easterly direction I travelled a few hours and was fortunate enough to come to a great road which was manifestly much travelled leading towards the northeast My bag was now replenished with more than a gallon of parched oats and I had yet one pair of moccasins made of raw hide but my shirt was totally gone and my last pair of trousers was now in actual service A tolerable waistcoat still remained to me and my great coat though full of honourable scars was yet capable of much service Having resolved to pursue the road I was now in it was necessary again to resort to the utmost degree of caution to prevent surprise Travelling only after it was dark and taking care to stop before the appearance of day my progress was not rapid but my safety was preserved The acquisition of food had now become difficult and when my oats began to fail I resorted to the dangerous expedient of attacking the corn-crib of a planter that was near the road The house was built of round logs and was covered with boards One of these boards I succeeded in removing on the side of the crib opposite from the dwelling and by thrusting my arm downwards was able to reach the corn--of which I took as much as filled my bag the pockets of my great coat and a large handkerchief that I had preserved through all the vicissitudes of my journey This opportune supply of corn furnished me with food more than a week and before it was consumed I reached the Appomattox river which I crossed in a canoe that I tied at the shore a few miles above the town of Petersburg Having approached Petersburg in the night I was afraid to attempt to pass through it lest the patrol should fall in with me and turning to left through the country reached the river and crossed in safety The great road leading to Richmond is so distinguishingly marked above the other ways in this part of Virginia that there was no difficulty in following it and on the third night after passing Petersburg I obtained a sight of the capitol of Virginia It was only a little after midnight when the city presented itself to my sight but here as well as at Petersburg I was afraid to attempt to go through the town under cover of the darkness because of the patrol Turning therefore back into a forest about two miles from the small town on the south-side of the river I lay there until after twelve o'clock in the day when loosening the package from my back and taking it in my hand in the form of a bundle I advanced into the village as if I had only come from plantation in the neighbourhood This was on Sunday I believe though according to my computation it was Monday but it must have been Sunday for the village was quiet and in passing it I only saw two or three persons whom I passed as if I had not seen them No one spoke to me and I gained the bridge in safety and crossed it without attracting the least attention Entering the city of Richmond I kept along the principal street walking at a slow pace and turning my head from side to side as if much attracted by the objects around me Few persons were in the street and I was careful to appear more attentive to the houses than to the people At the upper end of the city I saw a great crowd of ladies and gentlemen who were I believe returning from church Whilst these people were passing me I stood in the street on the outside of the foot pavement with my face turned to the opposite side of the street They all went by without taking any notice of me and when they were gone I again resumed my leisure walk along the pavement and reached the utmost limit of the town without being accosted by any one As soon as I was clear of the city I quickened my pace assumed the air of a man in great haste sometimes actually ran and in less than an hour was safely lodged in the thickest part of the woods that lay on the north of Richmond and full four miles from the river This was the boldest exploit that I had performed since leaving my mistress except the visit I paid to the gentleman in Georgia My corn was now failing but as I had once entered a crib secretly I felt but little apprehension on account of future supplies After this time I never wanted corn and did not again suffer by hunger until I reached the place of my nativity After leaving Richmond I again kept along the great road by which I had travelled on my way south taking great care not to expose my person unnecessarily For several nights I saw no white people on the way but was often met by black ones whom I avoided by turning out of the road but one moonlight night five or six days after I left Richmond a man stepped out of the woods almost at my side and accosting me in a familiar manner asked me which way I was travelling how long I had been on the road and made many inquiries concerning the course of my late journey This man was a mulatto and carried a heavy cane or rather club in his hand I did not like his appearance and the idea of a familiar conversation with any one seemed to terrify me I determined to watch my companion closely and he appeared equally intent on observing me but at the same time that he talked with me he was constantly drawing closer to and following behind me This conduct increased my suspicion and I began to wish to get rid of him but could not at the moment imagine how I should effect my purpose To avoid him I crossed the road several times but still he followed me closely The moon which shone brightly upon our backs cast his shadow far before me and enabled me to perceive his motions with the utmost accuracy without turning my head towards him He carried his club under his left arm and at length raised his right hand gently took the stick by the end and drawing it slowly over his head was in the very act of striking a blow at me when springing backward and raising my own staff at the same moment I brought him to the ground by a stroke on his forehead and when I had him down beat him over the back and sides with my weapon until he roared for mercy and begged me not to kill him I left him in no condition to pursue me and hastened on my way resolved to get as far from him before day as my legs would carry me This man was undoubtedly one of those wretches who are employed by white men to kidnap and betray such unfortunate people of colour as may chance to fall into their hands but for once the deceiver was deceived and he who intended to make prey of me had well nigh fallen a sacrifice himself The same night I crossed the Pammunky river near the village of Hanover by swimming and secreted myself before day in a dense cedar thicket The next night after I had travelled several miles in ascending a hill I saw the head of a man rise on the opposite side without having heard any noise I instantly ran into the woods and concealed myself behind a large tree The traveller was on horseback and the road being sandy and his horse moving only at a walk I had not heard his approach until I saw him He also saw me for when he came opposite the place where I stood he stopped his horse in the road and desired me to tell him how far it was to some place the name of which I have forgotten As I made no answer he again repeated the inquiry and then I need not be afraid to speak as he did not wish to hurt me but no answer being given him he at last I might as well speak and rode on Before day I reached the Matapony river and crossed it by wading but knowing that I was not far from Maryland I fell into a great indiscretion and forgot the wariness and caution that had enabled me to overcome obstacles apparently insurmountable Anxious to get forward I neglected to conceal myself before day but travelled until daybreak before I sought a place of concealment and unfortunately when I looked for a hiding place none was at hand This compelled me to keep on the road until gray twilight for the purpose of reaching a wood that was in view before me but to gain this wood I was obliged to pass a house that stood at the road side and when only about fifty yards beyond the house a white man opened the door and seeing me in the road called to me to stop As his order was not obeyed he set his dog upon me The dog was quickly vanquished by my stick and setting off to run at full speed I at the same moment heard the report of a gun and received its contents in my legs chiefly about and in my hams I fell on the road and was soon surrounded by several persons who it appeared were a party of patrollers who had gathered together in this house They ordered me to cross my hands which order not being immediately obeyed they beat me with sticks and stones until I was almost senseless and entirely unable to make resistance They then bound me with cords and dragged me by the feet back to the house and threw me into the kitchen like a dead dog One of my eyes was almost beaten out and the blood was running from my mouth nose and ears but in this condition they refused to wash the blood from my face or even to give me a drink of water In a short time a justice of the peace arrived and when he looked at me ordered me to be unbound and to have water to wash myself and also some bread to eat This man's heart appeared not to be altogether void of sensibility for he reprimanded in harsh terms those who had beaten me told them that their conduct was brutal and that it would have been more humane to kill me outright than to bruise and mangle me in the manner they had done He then interrogated me as to my name place of abode and place of destination and afterwards demanded the name of my master To all these inquiries I made no reply except that I was going to Maryland where I lived The justice told me it was his duty under the law to send me to jail and I was immediately put into a cart and carried to a small village called Bowling Green which I reached before ten o'clock There I was locked up in the jail and a doctor came to examine my legs and extract the shot from my wounds In the course of the operation he took out thirty-four duck shot and after dressing my legs left me to my own reflections No fever followed in the train of my disasters which I attributed to the state of my blood by long fasting and the fatigues I had undergone In the afternoon the jailer came to see me and brought my daily allowance of provisions and a jug of water The provisions consisted of more than a pound of corn-bread and some boiled bacon As my appetite was good I immediately devoured more than two-thirds of this food but reserved the rest for supper For several days I was not able to stand and in this period found great difficulty in performing the ordinary offices of life for myself no one coming to give me any aid but I did not suffer for want of food the daily allowance of the jailer being quite sufficient to appease the cravings of hunger After I grew better and was able to walk in the jail the jailer frequently called to see me and endeavoured to prevail on me to tell where I had come from but in this undertaking he was no more successful than the justice had been in the same business I remained in the jail more than a month and in this time became quite fat and strong but saw no way by which I could escape The jail was of brick the floors were of solid oak boards and the door of the same material was secured by iron bolts let into its posts and connected together by a strong band of iron reaching from the one to the other Every thing appeared sound and strong and to add to my security my feet were chained together from the time my wounds were healed This chain I acquired the knowledge of removing from my feet by working out of its socket a small iron pin that secured the bolt that held the chain round one of my legs The jailer came to see me with great regularity every morning and evening but remained only a few minutes when he came leaving me entirely alone at all other times XXIV When I had been in prison thirty-nine days and had quite recovered from the wounds that I had received the jailer was late in coming to me with my breakfast and going to the door I began to beat against it with my fist for the purpose of making a noise After beating some time against the door I happened by mere accident to strike my fist against one of the posts which to my surprise I discovered by its sound to be a mere hollow shell encrusted with a thin coat of sound timber and as I struck it the rotten wood crumbled to pieces within On a more careful examination of this post I became satisfied that I could easily split it to pieces by the aid of the iron bolt that confined my feet The jailer came with my breakfast and reprimanded me for making a noise This day appeared as long to me as a week had done heretofore but night came at length and as soon as the room in which I was confined had become quite dark I disentangled myself from the irons with which I was bound and with the aid of the long bolt easily wrenched from its place the large staple that held one end of the bar that lay across the door The hasps that held the lock in its place were drawn away almost without force and the door swung open of its own weight I now walked out into the jail-yard and found that all was quiet and that only a few lights were burning in the village windows At first I walked slowly along the road but soon quickened my pace and ran along the high-way until I was more than a mile from the jail then taking to the woods I travelled all night in a northern direction At the approach of day I concealed myself in a cedar thicket where I lay until the next evening without any thing to eat On the second night after my escape I crossed the Potomac at Hoe's ferry in a small boat that I found tied at the side of the ferry flat and on the night following crossed the Patuxent in a canoe which I found chained at the shore About one o'clock in the morning I came to the door of my wife's cabin and stood there I believe more than five minutes before I could summon sufficient fortitude to knock I at length rapped lightly on the door and was immediately asked in the well-known voice of my wife Who is there--I replied Charles She then came to the door and opening it slowly Who is this that speaks so much like my husband I then rushed into the cabin and made myself known to her but it was some time before I could convince her that I was really her husband returned from Georgia The children were then called up but they had forgotten me When I attempted to take them in my arms they fled from me and took refuge under the bed of their mother My eldest boy who was four years old when I was carried away still retained some recollections of once having had a father but could not believe that I was that father My wife who at first was overcome by astonishment at seeing me again in her cabin and was incapable of giving credit to the fidelity of her own vision after I had been in the house a few minutes seemed to awake from a dream and gathering all three of her children in her arms thrust them into my lap as I sat in the corner clapped her hands laughed and cried by turns and in her ecstasy forgot to give me any supper until I at length told her that I was hungry Before I entered the house I felt as if I could eat any thing in the shape of food but now that I attempted to eat my appetite had fled and I sat up all night with my wife and children When on my journey I thought of nothing but getting home and never reflected that when at home I might still be in danger but now that my toils were ended I began to consider with myself how I could appear in safety in Calvert county where everybody must know that I was a runaway slave With my heart thrilling with joy when I looked upon my wife and children who had not hoped ever to behold me again yet fearful of the coming of daylight which must expose me to be arrested as a fugitive slave I passed the night between the happiness of the present and the dread of the future In all the toils dangers and suffering of my long journey my courage had never forsaken me The hope of again seeing my wife and little ones had borne me triumphantly through perils that even now I reflect upon as upon some extravagant dream but when I found myself at rest under the roof of my wife the object of my labour attained and no motive to arouse my energies or give them the least impulse that firmness of resolution which had so long sustained me suddenly vanished from my bosom and I passed the night with my children around me oppressed by a melancholy foreboding of my future destiny The idea that I was utterly unable to afford protection and safeguard to my own family and was myself even more helpless than they tormented my bosom with alternate throbs of affection and fear until the dawn broke in the cast and summoned me to decide upon my future conduct When morning came I went to the great house and showed myself to my wife's master and mistress who treated me with great kindness and gave me a good breakfast Mr Symmes at first advised me to conceal myself but soon afterwards told me to go to work in the neighbourhood for wages I continued to hire myself about among the farmers until after the war broke out and until Commodore Barney came into the Patuxent with his flotilla when I enlisted on board one of his barges and was employed sometimes in the capacity of a seaman and sometimes as cook of the barge I had been on board only a few days when the British fleet entered the Patuxent and forced our flotilla high up the river I was present when the flotilla was blown up and assisted in the performance of that operation upon the barge that I was in The guns and the principal part of the armament of the flotilla were sunk in the river and lost I marched with the troops of Barney from Benedict to Bladensburg and travelled nearly the whole of the distance through heavy forests of timber or numerous and dense cedar thickets It is my opinion that if General Winder had marched the half of the troops that he had at Bladensburg down to the lower part of Prince George county and attacked the British in these woods and cedar thickets not a man of them would ever have reached Bladensburg I feel confident that in the country through which I marched one hundred Americans would have destroyed a thousand of the enemy by felling trees across the road and attacking them in ambush When we reached Bladensburg and the flotilla men were drawn up in line to work at their cannon armed with their cutlasses I volunteered to assist in working the cannon that occupied the first place on the left of the Commodore We had a full and perfect view of the British army as it advanced along the road leading to the bridge over the East Branch and I could not but admire the handsome manner in which the British officers led on their fatigued and worn-out soldiers I thought then and think yet that General Ross was one of the finest looking men that I ever saw on horseback I stood at my gun until the Commodore was shot down when he ordered us to retreat as I was told by the officer who commanded our gun If the militia regiments that lay upon our right and left could have been brought to charge the British in close fight as they crossed the bridge we should have killed or taken the whole of them in a short time but the militia ran like sheep chased by dogs My readers will not perhaps condemn me if I here make a short digression from my main narrative to give some account of the part that I took in the war on the shores of the Chesapeake and the Patuxent I did not enlist with Commodore Barney until the month of December but as I resided in Calvert county in the summer of I had an opportunity of witnessing many of the evils that followed in the train of war before I assumed the profession of arms myself In the spring of the year the British fleet came into the bay and from this time the origin of the troubles and distresses of the people of the Western Shore may be dated I had been employed at a fishery near the mouth of the Patuxent from early March until the latter part of May when a British vessel of war came off the mouth of the river and sent her boats up to drive us away from our fishing ground There was but little property at the fishery that could be destroyed but the enemy cut the seines to pieces and burned the sheds belonging to the place They then marched up two miles into the country burned the house of a planter and brought away with them several cattle that were found in his fields They also carried off more than twenty slaves which were never again restored to their owner although on the following day he went on board the ship with a flag of truce and offered a large ransom for these slaves These were the first black people whom I had known to desert to the British although the practice was afterwards so common In the course of this summer and the summer of several thousand black people deserted from their masters and mistresses and escaped to the British fleet None of these people were ever regained by their owners as the British naval officers treated them as free people and placed them on the footing of military deserters In the fall of this year a lady by the name of Wilson who owned more than a hundred slaves lost them all in one night except one man who had a wife and several children on an adjoining estate and as he could not take his family with him on account of the rigid guard that was kept over them he refused to go himself The slaves of Mrs Wilson effected their escape in the following manner Two or three of the men having agreed amongst themselves that they would run away and go to the fleet they stole a canoe one night and went off to the ship that lay nearest the shore When on board they informed the officer of the ship that their mistress owned more than a hundred other slaves whom they had left behind them They were then advised to return home and remain there until the next night and then bring with them to the beach all the slaves on the plantation--the officer promising that he would send a detachment of boats to the shore to bring them off This advice was followed and the fugitives returned before day to their cabins on the plantation of their mistress On the next night having communicated their plans to some of their fellow-slaves they rose about midnight and partly by persuasion partly by compulsion carried off all the slaves on the plantation with the exception of the man already named When they reached the beach they kindled a fire as had been concerted with the British officers and the boats of the fleet came off and removed this whole party on board In the morning when the overseer of Mrs Wilson arose and went to call his hands to the field he found only empty cabins in the quarter with a single man remaining to tell what had become of his fellows This was the greatest disaster that had befallen any individual in our neighbourhood in the course of the war and as the sufferer was a lady much sympathy was excited in her favour A large number of gentlemen met together for the purpose of endeavouring to devise some means of recovering the fugitive slaves Their consultations ended in sending a deputation of gentlemen on board the fleet with a flag of truce to solicit the restoration of the deserters either as a matter of favour or for such ransom as might be agreed upon Strong hopes were entertained that the runaways might be induced voluntarily to return to the service of their mistress as she had never treated them with great severity To accomplish if possible this latter end I was spoken to to go along with the flag of truce in the assumed character of the servant of one of the gentlemen who bore it but in the real character of the advocate of the mistress for the purpose of inducing her slaves to return to her service We went on board the ship in the afternoon and I observed that the gentlemen who went with me were received by the British officers with very little ceremony The captain did not show himself on deck nor were the gentlemen invited into his cabin They were shown into a large square room under the first deck of the ship which was a and here a great number of officers came to talk to them and ask them questions concerning the war and the state of the country The whole of the runaways were on board this ship lounging about on the main deck or leaning against the sides of the ship's bulwarks I went amongst them and talked to them a long time on the subject of returning home but found that their heads were full of notions of liberty and happiness in some of the West India islands In the afternoon all the gentlemen except one returned home in the boat that they had come off in The gentleman who remained on board was a young man of pleasing manners and lively conversation who appeared even before the other gentlemen who had come with the flag had left the ship to have become quite a favourite with the younger British officers Permission was obtained of the British captain for this young gentleman to remain on board a few days for the purpose as he alleged of seeing the curiosities of the ship He had permission to retain me with him as his servant and I was instructed to exert myself to the utmost to prevail on the runaway slaves to return to their mistress The ship lay at anchor off the shore of Calvert county until the second night after I came on board when from some cause which I was not able to understand this ship and all the rest of the fleet got under weigh and stood down the Bay to the neighbourhood of Tangier Islands where she again cast anchor soon after sunrise the next morning in ten fathoms water I was now at least seventy or eighty miles from home in a ship of the public enemies of the country and liable to be carried off to sea and to be conveyed to the most distant part of the world To increase my alarm about noon of this day a sloop of war cast anchor under the stern of our ship and all the black people that were with us were immediately removed on board the sloop I was invited and even urged to go with the others who I was told were bound to the island of Trinidad in the West Indies where they would have lands given to them and where they were to be free I returned many thanks for their kind offers but respectfully declined them telling those who made them that I was already a freeman and though I owned no land myself yet I could have plenty of land of other people to cultivate In the evening the sloop weighed anchor and stood down the Bay with more than two hundred and fifty black people on board I watched her as she sailed away from us until the darkness of the night shut her out from my sight In the morning she was not to be seen What became of the miserable mass of black fugitives that this vessel took to sea I never learned My mission was now at an end and I spoke this day to the young gentleman under whose care I was to endeavour to procure some means of conveying both him and me back again to Calvert My protector seemed no less embarrassed than I was and informed me that the officers of the ship they would not land us on the Western Shore within less than two weeks I was obliged to content myself the best way I could in my confinement on shipboard and I amused myself by talking to the sailors and giving them an account of the way in which I had passed my life on the tobacco and cotton plantations in return for which the seamen gave many long stories of their adventures at sea and of the battles they had been engaged in I lived well whilst on board this ship as they allowed me to share in a mess In compensation for their civility I gave them many useful instructions in the art of taking fish in the Bay This great ship lay at anchor like a vast castle moored by the cable but there were many small vessels used as tenders to the fleet that were continually sailing up and down the Bay by night as well as by day in pursuit of any thing that they might fall in with that they could take from the Americans Whilst I was on board I saw more than thirty vessels chiefly Bay craft brought to our anchorage and there burned after being stripped of every thing valuable that could be taken from them The people who manned and navigated these vessels were made prisoners and dispersed amongst the several ships of the fleet until they could be removed to Halifax or the West Indies One day a small schooner was seen standing out of the mouth of Nanticoke river and beating up the Bay Chase was immediately given by several of the light vessels belonging to the fleet and continued until nightfall when I could no longer see the sails but the next day the British vessels returned bringing in their company the little schooner which was manned by her owner who acted as captain and two boys On board the schooner besides her crew were several passengers seven in number I believe The people were taken out of this little vessel which was laden with Indian corn and after her cargo had been removed she was burned in view of her owner who seemed much affected at the sight and that it was all the property he owned in the world and that his wife and children were now beggars The passengers and crew of this little vessel were all retained as prisoners of war on board the in which I was and were shut up every night in a room on the lower gun deck In this room there were several port-holes which were suffered to remain open for the benefit of the air After these people had been on board three or four days a boat's crew that had been out somewhere in the evening when they returned to the ship tied the boat with a long rope to one of the halyards of the ship and left the boat floating near the ship's bows Some time after night the tide turned moved the boat along the side of the ship and floated it directly under the port-holes of the prisoners' room The night was dark and warm and I had taken a station on the upper deck and was leaning over the bulwarks when my attention was drawn towards the water by hearing something drop into the boat that lay along side Dark as it was I could see the forms of men passing out of the port-holes into the boat In less than two minutes nine persons had entered the boat and I then heard a low whisper which I could not understand but immediately afterwards saw the boat drifting with the tide which convinced me that she was loose and that the prisoners were in her I nothing and in a short time the boat was out of sight She had however not been long gone when the watch on deck passed near me and looking over the side of the ship called to the officer on deck that the yawl was gone The officer on deck instantly called to some one below to examine the room of the prisoners and received for answer that the prisoners had fled A gun was immediately fired under me on one of the lower decks the ship's bells were tolled numerous blue lights were made ready and cast high into the air which performing a curve in the atmosphere illuminated the face of the water all the way from the ship to the place where they fell The other ships in the fleet all answered by firing guns casting out lights and ringing their large bells Three boats put off from our ship in search of the fugitives with as little delay as possible and after being absent more than an hour returned without finding those who had escaped This affair presented one of the finest night scenes that can well be imagined The deep thunder of the heavy artillery as it broke upon the stillness of the night and re-echoed from the distant shores the solemn and mournful tones of the numerous bells as they answered each other from ship to ship as the sounds rose in the air and died away in the distance on the wide expanse of waters with the shouts of the seamen and the pale and ghastly appearance of the blue lights as they rose into the atmosphere and then descended and died away in the water--all combined together to affect both the eye and the ear in a manner the most impressive One of the prisoners remained in the ship not having courage to undertake with his companions the daring and dangerous exploit of escaping from the ship in her own boat When the morning came this man explained to the officers of the ship the whole plan that had been devised and pursued by his companions When they found that the boat had floated under the port-holes of their room some one of the number proposed to the rest to attempt to escape as the oars of the boat had been left in her but a difficulty suggested itself at the outset which was this the oars could not be worked on the boat without making a great noise sufficient to alarm the watch on deck To avoid this one of the prisoners he would undertake to pull off his coat and muffle one of the oars with it and scull the boat until they should be clear of the fleet when they could lay both oars on the boat and row to shore We lay much nearer to the Western Shore than we were to the Eastern but this man the design of the prisoners was to pull to the Eastern Shore All the boats that went from our ship pulled for the Western Shore and by this means the prisoners escaped without being seen The captain of the ship was much enraged at the escape of these prisoners and swore he would be avenged of the Yankees in a short time In this he was as good as his word for the very next day he fitted out an expedition consisting of eleven long boats and more than two hundred men who landed on the Western Shore and burned three house with all their furniture and killed a great number of cattle The officer who headed this expedition brought back with him a large silk handkerchief full of silver spoons and other articles of silver plate I saw him exhibit these trophies of his valour amongst his brother officers on the deck of the ship After I had been on board nearly a week a furious northeast storm came on and blew for three days accompanied with frequent gusts of rain In the evening of the second day we saw two schooners standing down the bay and sailing close on the wind so as to pass between the fleet and the Eastern Shore As it was dangerous for large ships to approach much nearer the Eastern Shore than where we lay several of the tenders of the fleet amounting in all to more than a dozen were ordered by signal to to intercept the strange sails and bring them to the fleet The tenders got under weigh and stood before the wind for the purpose of encountering the schooners as they came down the Bay These schooners proved to be two heavy armed American privateers and when the tenders approached them a furious battle commenced with cannon which lasted more than an hour and until the privateers had passed quite below the anchorage of the fleet Several of the tenders were much damaged in their hulls and rigging and it was that they lost more than twenty men I could not perceive that the privateers sustained the least injury as they never shortened sail nor altered their course until they had passed to the windward of all the ships of the fleet when they changed their bearing and stood for the Capes of Virginia There were nearly forty vessels in the fleet great and small and yet these two privateers braved the whole of them in open daylight and went to sea in spite of them On the ninth day after we came on board the fleet again moved up the Bay and when we were off the mouth of the Potomac the captain sent the young gentleman in whose service I was together with myself on shore in his own gig The lieutenant who had command of the gig after he set us on shore went up to the house of a farmer whose estate lay upon to the Bay and after pilfering the premises of every thing that he could carry away set fire to the house and returned to his boat In the course of the summer and fall of the year I witnessed many other atrocities of equal enormity I continued with the army after the sack of Washington and assisted in the defence of Baltimore but in the fall of I procured my discharge from the army and went to work in Baltimore as a free black man From this time until the year I worked in various places in Maryland as a free man sometimes in Baltimore sometimes in Annapolis and frequently in Washington My wife died in the year and from that time I was not often in Calvert county I was fortunate in the enjoyment of good health and by constant economy I found myself in possession in the year of three hundred and fifty dollars in money the proceeds of my labour I now removed to the neighbourhood of Baltimore and purchased a lot of twelve acres of ground upon which I erected a small house and became a farmer on my own account and upon my own property I purchased a yoke of oxen and two cows and became a regular attendant of the Baltimore market where I sold the products of my own farm and dairy In the course of two or three years I had brought my little farm into very good culture and had increased my stock of cattle to four cows and several younger animals I now lived very happily and had an abundance of all the necessaries of life around me I had married a second wife who bore me four children and I now looked forward to an old age of comfort if not of ease but I was soon to be awakened from this dream XXV In the month of June as I was ploughing in my lot three gentlemen rode up to my fence and alighting from their horses all came over the fence and approached me when one of them told me he was the sheriff and had a writ in his pocket which commanded him to take me to Baltimore I was not conscious of having done any thing injurious to any one but yet felt a distrust of these men who were all strangers to me I told them I would go with them if they would permit me to turn my oxen loose from the plough but it was my intention to seek an opportunity of escaping to the house of a gentleman who lived about a mile from me This purpose I was not able to effect for whilst I was taking the yoke from the oxen one of the gentlemen came behind me and knocked me down with a heavy whip that he carried in his hand When I recovered from the stunning effects of this blow I found myself bound with my hands behind me and strong cords closely wrapped about my arms In this condition I was forced to set out immediately for Baltimore without speaking to my wife or even entering my door I expected that on arriving at Baltimore I should be taken before a judge for the purpose of being tried but in this I was deceived They led me to the city jail and there shut me up with several other black people both men and women who told me that they had lately been purchased by a trader from Georgia I now saw the extent of my misfortune but could not learn who the persons were who had seized me In the evening however one of the gentlemen who had brought me from home came into the jail with the jailer and asked me if I knew him On being answered in the negative he told me that he knew me very well and asked me if I did not recollect the time when he and his brother had whipped me before my master's door in Georgia I now recognised the features of the younger of the two brothers of my mistress but this man was so changed in his appearance from the time when I had last seen him that if he had not declared himself I should never have known him When I left Georgia he was not more than twenty-one or two years of age and had black bushy hair His hair was now thin and gray and all his features were changed After lying in jail a little more than two weeks strongly ironed my fellow prisoners and I were one day chained together handcuffed in pairs and in this way driven about ten miles out of Baltimore where we remained all night On the evening of the second day we halted at Bladensburg and were shut up in a small house within full view of the very ground where sixteen years before I had fought in the ranks of the army of the United States in defence of the liberty and independence of that which I then regarded as my country It seemed as if it had been but yesterday that I had seen the British columns advancing across the bridge now before me directing their fire against me and my companions in arms The thought now struck me that if I had deserted that day and gone over to the enemies of the United States how different would my situation at this moment have been And this thought I is the reward of the part I bore in the dangers and fatigues of that disastrous battle On the next morning we marched through Washington and as we passed in front of the President's house I saw an old gentleman walking in the grounds near the gate This man I was told was the President of the United States Within four weeks after we left Washington I was in Milledgeville in Georgia near which the man who had kidnapped me resided He took me home with him and set me to work on his plantation but I had now enjoyed liberty too long to submit quietly to the endurance of slavery I had no sooner come here than I began to devise ways of escaping again from the hands of my tyrants and of making my way to the northern states The month of August was now approaching which is a favourable season of the year to travel on account of the abundance of food that is to be found in the corn fields and orchards but I remembered the dreadful sufferings that I had endured in my former journey from the south and determined if possible to devise some scheme of getting away that would not subject me to such hardships After several weeks of consideration I resolved to run away go to some of the seaports and endeavour to get a passage on board a vessel bound to a northern city With this view I assumed the appearance of resignation and composure under the new aspect of my fortune and even went so far as to tell my new master that I lived more comfortably with him in his cotton fields than I had formerly done on my own small farm in Maryland though I believe my master did me the justice to give no credit to my assertions on this subject From the moment I discovered in Maryland that I had fallen into the hands of the brother of my former mistress I gave up all hope of contesting his right to arrest me with success at law as I supposed he had come with authority to reclaim me as the property of his sister but after I had returned to Georgia and had been at work some weeks on the plantation of my new master I learned that he now claimed me as his own slave and that he had reported he had purchased me in Baltimore It was now clear to me that this man having by some means learned the place of my residence in Maryland had kidnapped and now held me as his slave without the colour of legal right but complaint on my part was useless and resistance vain I was again reduced to the condition of a common field slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia and compelled to subsist on the very scanty and coarse food allowed to the southern slaves I had been absent from Georgia almost twenty years and in that period great changes had doubtlessly taken place in the face of the country as well as in the condition of human society I had never been in Milledgeville until I was brought there by the man who had kidnapped me in Maryland and I was now a slave among entire strangers and had no friend to give me the consolation of kind words such as I had formerly received from my master in Morgan county The plantation on which I was now a slave had formerly belonged to the father of my mistress and some of my fellow-slaves had been well acquainted with her in her youth From these people I learned that after the death of my master and my flight from Georgia my mistress had become the wife of a second husband who had removed with her to the state of Louisiana more than fifteen years ago After ascertaining these facts which proved beyond all doubt that my present master had no right whatsoever to me in either law or justice I determined that before encountering the dangers and sufferings that must necessarily attend my second flight from Georgia I would attempt to claim the protection of the laws of the country and try to get myself discharged from the unjust slavery in which I was now held For this purpose I went to Milledgeville one Sunday and inquired for a lawyer of a black man whom I met in the street This person told me that his master was a lawyer and went with me to his house The lawyer after talking to me some time told me that my master was his client and that he therefore could not undertake my cause but referred me to a young gentleman who he would do my business for me Accordingly to this young man I went and after relating my whole story to him he told me that he believed he could not do any thing for me as I had no witnesses to prove my freedom I rejoined that it seemed hard that I must be compelled to prove myself a freeman and that it would appear more consonant to reason that my master should prove me to be a slave He however assured me that this was not the law of Georgia where every man of colour was presumed to be a slave until he could prove that he was free He then told me that if I expected him to talk to me I must give him a fee whereupon I gave him all the money I had been able to procure since my arrival in the country which was two dollars and seventy-five cents When I offered him this money the lawyer tossed his head and such a trifle was not worth accepting but nevertheless he took it and then asked me if I could get some more money before the next Sunday That if I could get another dollar he would issue a writ and have me brought before the court but if he succeeded in getting me set free I must engage to serve him a year To these conditions I agreed and signed a paper which the lawyer wrote and which was signed by two persons as witnesses The brother of my pretended master was yet living in this neighbourhood and the lawyer advised me to have him brought forward as a witness to prove that I was not the slave of my present pretended owner On the Wednesday following my visit to Milledgeville the sheriff came to my master's plantation and took me from the field to the house telling me as I walked beside him that he had a writ which commanded him to take me to Milledgeville Instead however of obeying the command of his writ when we arrived at the house he took a bond of my master that he would produce me at the court-house on the next day Friday and then rode away leaving me at the mercy of my kidnapper Since I had been on this plantation I had never been whipped although all the other slaves of whom there were more than fifty were frequently flogged without any apparent cause I had all along attributed my exemption from the lash to the fears of my master He knew I had formerly run away from his sister on account of her cruelty and his own savage conduct to me and I believed that he was still apprehensive that a repetition of his former barbarity might produce the same effect that it had done twenty years before His evil passions were like fire covered with ashes concealed not extinguished He now found that I was determined to try to regain my liberty at all events and the sheriff was no sooner gone than the overseer was sent for to come from the field and I was tied up and whipped with the long lashed negro whip until I fainted and was carried in a state of insensibility to my lodgings in the quarter It was night when I recovered my understanding sufficiently to be aware of my true situation I now found that my wounds had been oiled and that I was wrapped in a piece of clean linen cloth but for several days I was unable to leave my bed When Friday came I was not taken to Milledgeville and afterwards learned that my master reported to the court that I had been taken ill and was not able to leave the house The judge asked no questions as to the cause of my illness At the end of two weeks I was taken to Milledgeville and carried before a judge who first asked a few questions of my master as to the length of time that he had owned me and the place where he had purchased me He stated in my presence that he had purchased me with several others at public auction in the city of Baltimore and had paid five hundred and ten dollars for me I was not permitted to speak to the court much less to contradict this falsehood in the manner it deserved The brother of my master was then called as a witness by my lawyer but the witness refused to be sworn or examined on account of his interest in me as his slave In support of his refusal he produced a bill of sale from my master to himself for an equal undivided half part of the slave Charles This bill of sale was dated several weeks previous to the time of trial and gave rise to an argument between the opposing lawyers that continued until the court adjourned in the evening On the next morning I was again brought into court and the judge now delivered his opinion which was that the witness could not be compelled to give evidence in a cause to which he was really though not nominally a party The court then proceeded to give judgment in the cause now before it and declared that the law was well settled in Georgia that every negro was presumed to be a slave until he proved his freedom by the clearest evidence That where a negro was found in the custody or keeping of a white man the law declared that white man to be his master without any evidence on the subject But the case before the court was exceedingly plain and free from all doubt or difficulty Here the master has brought this slave into the state of Georgia as his property has held him as a slave ever since and still holds him as a slave The title of the master in this case is the best title that a man can have to any property and the order of the court is that the slave Charles be returned to the custody of his master I was immediately ordered to return home and from this time until I left the plantation my life was a continual torment to me The overseer often came up to me in the field and gave me several lashes with his long whip over my naked back through mere wantonness and I was often compelled after I had done my day's work in the field to cut wood or perform some other labour at the house until long after dark My sufferings were too great to be borne long by any human creature and to a man who had once tasted the sweets of liberty they were doubly tormenting There was nothing in the form of danger that could intimidate me if the road on which I had to encounter it led me to freedom That season of the year most favourable to my escape from bondage had at length arrived The corn in the fields was so far grown as to be fit for roasting the peaches were beginning to ripen and the sweet potatoes were large enough to be eaten but notwithstanding all this the difficulties that surrounded me were greater than can easily be imagined by any one who has never been a slave in the lower country of Georgia In the first place I was almost naked having no other clothes than a ragged shirt of tow cloth and a pair of old trousers of the same material with an old woollen jacket that I had brought with me from home In addition to this I was closely watched every evening until I had finished the labour assigned me and then I was locked up in a small cabin by myself for the night This cabin was really a prison and had been built for the purpose of confining such of the slaves of this estate as were tried in the evening and sentenced to be whipped in the morning It was built of strong oak logs hewn square and dovetailed together at the corners It had no window in it but as the logs did not fit very close together there was never any want of air in this jail in which I had been locked up every night since my trial before the court On Sundays I was permitted to go to work in the fields with the other people who worked on that day if I chose so to do but at this time I was put under the charge of an old African negro who was instructed to give immediate information if I attempted to leave the field To escape on Sunday was impossible and there seemed to be no hope of getting out of my sleeping room the floor of which was made of strong pine plank Fortune at length did for me that which I had not been able to accomplish by the greatest efforts for myself The lock that was on the door of my nightly prison was a large stock lock and had been clumsily fitted on the door so that the end of the lock pressed against the door-case and made it difficult to shut the door even in dry weather When the weather was damp and the wood was swollen with moisture it was not easy to close the door at all Late in the month of September the weather became cloudy and much rain fell The clouds continued to obscure the heavens for four or five days One evening when I was ordered to my house as it was called the overseer followed me without a light although it was very dark When I was in the house he pushed the door after me with all his strength The violence of the effort caused the door to pass within the case at the top for one or two feet and this held it so fast that he could not again pull it open Supposing in the extreme darkness that the door was shut he turned the key and the bolt of the lock passing on the outside of the staple intended to receive it completely deceived him He then withdrew the key and went away Soon after he was gone I went to the door and feeling with my hands ascertained that it was not shut An opportunity now presented itself for me to escape from my prisonhouse with a prospect of being able to be so far from my master's residence before morning that none could soon overtake me even should the course of my flight be ascertained Waiting quietly until every one about the quarter had ceased to be heard I applied one of my feet to the door and giving it a strong push forced it open The world was now all before me but the darkness was so profound as to obscure from my vision the largest objects even a house at the distance of a few yards But dark as it was necessity compelled me to leave the plantation without delay and knowing only the great road that led to Milledgeville amongst the various roads of this country I set off at a brisk walk on this public highway assured that no one could apprehend me in so dark a night It was only about seven miles to Milledgeville and when I reached that town several lights were burning in the windows of the houses but keeping on directly through the village I neither saw nor heard any person in it and after gaining the open country my first care was to find some secure place where shelter could be found for the next day but no appearance of thick woods was to be seen for several miles and two or three hours must have elapsed before a forest of sufficient magnitude was found to answer my purposes It was perhaps three o'clock in the morning when I took refuge in a thick and dismal swamp that lay on the right hand of the road intending to remain here until daylight and then look out for a secret place to conceal myself in during the day Hitherto although the night was so extremely dark it had not rained any but soon after my halt in the swamp the rain began to fall in floods rather than in showers which made me as wet as if I had swum a river Daylight at length appeared but brought with it very little mitigation of my suffering for the swamp in which my hiding-place was lay in the midst of a well-peopled country and was surrounded on all sides by cotton and corn fields so close to me that the open spaces of the cleared land could be seen from my position It was dangerous to move lest some one should see me and painful to remain without food when hunger was consuming me My resting place in the swamp was within view of the road and soon after sunrise although it continued to rain fast numerous horsemen were seen passing along the road by the way that had led me to the swamp There was little doubt on my mind that these people were in search of me and the sequel proved that my surmises were well founded It rained throughout this day and the fear of being apprehended by those who came in pursuit of me confined me to the swamp until after dark the following evening when I ventured to leave the thicket and return to the high road the bearing of which it was impossible for me to ascertain on account of the dense clouds that obscured the heavens All that could be done in my situation was to take care not to follow that end of the road which had led me to the swamp Turning my back once more upon Milledgeville and walking at a quick pace every effort was made to remove myself as far as possible this night from the scene of suffering for which that swamp will be always memorable in my mind The rain had ceased to fall at the going down of the sun and the darkness of this second night was not so great as that of the first had been This circumstance was regarded by me as a happy presage of the final success that awaited my undertaking Events proved that I was no prophet for the dim light of this night was the cause of the dreadful misfortune that awaited me In a former part of this volume the reader is made acquainted with the deep interest that is taken by all the planters far and wide around the plantation from which a slave has escaped by running away Twenty years had wrought no change in favour of the fugitive nor had the feuds and dissensions that agitate and distract the communities of white men produced any relaxation in the friendship that they profess to feel and really do feel for each other on a question of so much importance to them all More than twenty miles of road had been left behind me this night and it must have been two or three o'clock in the morning when as I was passing a part of the road that led through a dense pine grove where the trees on either side grew close to the wheel tracks five or six men suddenly rushed upon me from both sides of the road and with loud cries of Kill him kill him accompanied with oaths and opprobrious language seized me dragged me to the ground and bound me fast with a long cord which was wrapped round my arms and body so as to confine my hands below my hips In this condition I was driven or rather dragged about two miles to a kind of tavern or public house that stood by the side of the road where my captors were joined soon after daylight by at least twenty of their companions who had been out all night waiting and watching for me on the other roads of this part of the country Those who had taken me were loudly applauded by their fellows and the whole party passed the morning in drinking singing songs and playing cards at this house At breakfast time they gave me a large cake of corn bread and some sour milk for breakfast About ten o'clock in the morning my master arrived at the tavern in company with two or three other gentlemen all strangers to me My master when he came into my presence looked at me and Well Charles you had bad luck in running away this time and immediately asked aloud what any person would give for me One man who was slightly intoxicated he would give four hundred dollars for me Other bids followed until my price was soon up to five hundred and eighty dollars for which I was stricken off by my master himself to a gentleman who immediately gave his note for me and took charge of me as his property XXVI The name of my new master was Jones a planter who was only a visiter in this part of the country his residence being about fifty miles down the country The next day my new master set off with me to the place of his residence permitting me to walk behind him as he rode on horseback and leaving me entirely unshackled I was resolved that as my owner treated me with so much liberality the trust he reposed in me should not be broken until after we had reached his home though the determination of again running away and attempting to escape from Georgia never abandoned me for a moment The country through which we passed on our journey was not rich The soil was sandy light and in many places much exhausted by excessive tillage The timber in the woods where the ground was high was almost exclusively pine but many swamps and extensive tracts of low ground intervened in which maple gum and all the other trees common to such land in the south abounded No improvement in the condition of the slaves on the plantations was here perceptible but it appeared to me that there was now even a greater want of good clothes amongst the slaves on the various plantations that we passed than had existed twenty years before Everywhere the overseers still kept up the same custom of walking in the field with the long whip that has been elsewhere described and everywhere the slaves proved by the husky appearance of their skins and the dry sunburnt aspect of their hair that they were strangers to animal food On the second day of our journey in the evening we arrived at the residence of my master about eighty miles from Savannah The plantation which had now become the place of my residence was not large containing only about three hundred acres of cleared land and having on it about thirty working slaves of all classes It was now the very midst of the season of picking cotton and at the end of twenty years from the time of my first flight I again had a daily task assigned me with the promise of half a cent a pound for all the cotton I should pick beyond my day's work Picking cotton like every other occupation requiring active manipulation depends more upon sleight than strength and I was not now able to pick so much in a day as I was once able to do My master seemed to be a man ardently bent on the acquisition of wealth and came into the field where we were at work almost every day frequently remonstrating in strong language with the overseer because he did not get more work done Our rations on this place were a half peck of corn per week in addition to which we had rather more than a peck of sweet potatoes allowed to each person Our provisions were distributed to us on every Sunday morning by the overseer but my master was generally present either to see that justice was done to us or that injustice was not done to himself When I had been here about a week my master came into the field one day and in passing near me stopped and told me that I had now fallen into good hands as it was his practice not to whip his people much That he in truth never whipped them nor suffered his overseer to whip them except in flagrant cases That he had discovered a mode of punishment much more mild and at the same time much more effectual than flogging and that he governed his negroes exclusively under this mode of discipline He then told me that when I came home in the evening I must come to the house and that he would then make me acquainted with the principles upon which he chastised his slaves Going to the house in the evening according to orders my master showed me a pump set in a well in which the water rose within ten feet of the surface of the ground The spout of this pump was elevated at least thirteen feet above the earth and when the water was to be drawn from it the person who worked the handle ascended by a ladder to the proper station The water in this well although so near the surface was very cold and the pump discharged it in a large stream One of the women employed in the house had committed some offence for which she was to be punished and the opportunity was embraced of exhibiting to me the effect of this novel mode of torture upon the human frame The woman was stripped quite naked and tied to a post that stood just under the stream of water as it fell from the spout of the pump A lad was then ordered to ascend the ladder and pump water upon the head and shoulders of the victim who had not been under the waterfall more than a minute before she began to cry and scream in a most lamentable manner In a short time she exerted her strength in the most convulsive throes in trying to escape from the post but as the cords were strong this was impossible After another minute or a little more her cries became weaker and soon afterwards her head fell forward upon her breast and then the boy was ordered to cease pumping the water The woman was removed in a state of insensibility but recovered her faculties in about an hour The next morning she complained of lightness of head but was able to go to work This punishment of the pump as it is called was never inflicted on me and I am only able to describe it as it has been described to me by those who have endured it When the water first strikes the head and arm it is not at all painful but in a very short time it produces the sensation that is felt when heavy blows are inflicted with large rods of the size of a man's finger This perception becomes more and more painful until the skull bone and shoulder blades appear to be broken in pieces Finally all the faculties become oppressed breathing becomes more and more difficult until the eye-sight becomes dim and animation ceases This punishment is in fact a temporary murder as all the pains are endured that can be felt by a person who is deprived of life by being beaten with bludgeons--but after the punishment of the pump the sufferer is restored to existence by being laid in a bed and covered with warm clothes A giddiness of the head and oppression of the breast follows this operation for a day or two and sometimes longer The object of calling me to be a witness of this new mode of torture doubtlessly was was to intimidate me from running away but like medicines administered by empirics the spectacle had precisely the opposite effect from that which it was expected to produce After my arrival on this estate my intention had been to defer my elopement until the next year before I had seen the torture inflicted on this unfortunate woman but from that moment my resolution was unalterably fixed to escape as quickly as possible Such was my desperation of feeling at this time that I deliberated seriously upon the project of endeavouring to make my way southward for the purpose of joining the Indians in Florida Fortune reserved a more agreeable fate for me On the Saturday night after the woman was punished at the pump I stole a yard of cotton bagging from the cotton-gin house and converted it into a bag by means of a coarse needle and thread that I borrowed of one of the black women On the next morning when our weekly rations were distributed to us my portion was carefully placed in my bag under pretence of fears that it would be stolen from me if it was left open in the loft of the kitchen that I lodged in This day being Sunday I did not go to the field to work as usual on that day but under pretence of being unwell remained in the kitchen all day to be the better prepared for the toils of the following night After daylight had totally disappeared taking my bag under my arm under pretence of going to the mill to grind my corn I stole softly across the cotton fields to the nearest woods and taking an observation of the stars directed my course to the eastward resolved that in no event should any thing induce me to travel a single yard on the high road until at least one hundred miles from this plantation Keeping on steadily through the whole of this night and meeting with no swamps or briery thickets in my way I have no doubt that before daylight the plantation was more than thirty miles behind me Twenty years before this I had been in Savannah and noted at that time that great numbers of ships were in that port taking in loading of cotton My plan now was to reach Savannah in the best way I could by some means to be devised after my arrival in the city to procure a passage to some of the northern cities When day appeared before me I was in a large cotton field and before the woods could be reached it was gray dawn but the forest bordering on the field was large and afforded me good shelter through the day under the cover of a large thicket of swamp laurel that lay at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the field It now became necessary to kindle a fire for all my stock of provisions consisting of corn and potatoes was raw and undressed Less fortunate now than in my former flight no fire apparatus was in my possession and driven at last to the extremity I determined to endeavour to produce fire by rubbing two sticks together and spent at least two hours of incessant toil in this vain operation without the least prospect of success Abandoning this project at length I turned my thoughts to searching for a stone of some kind with which to endeavour to extract fire from an old jack knife that had been my companion in Maryland for more than three years My labours were fruitless No stone could be found in this swamp and the day was passed in anxiety and hunger a few raw potatoes being my only food Night at length came and with it a renewal of my travelling labours Avoiding with the utmost care every appearance of a road and pursuing my way until daylight I must have travelled at least thirty miles this night Awhile before day in crossing a field I fortunately came upon a bed of large pebbles on the side of a hill Several of these were deposited in my bag which enabled me when day arrived to procure fire with which I parched corn and roasted potatoes sufficient to subsist me for two or three days On the fourth night of my journey fortune directed me to a broad open highway that appeared to be much travelled Near the side of this road I established my quarters for the day in a thick pine wood for the purpose of making observations upon the people who travelled it and of judging thence of the part of the country to which it led Soon after daylight a wagon passed along drawn by oxen and loaded with bales of cotton then followed by some white men on horseback and soon after sunrise a whole train of wagons and carts all loaded with bales of cotton passed by following the wagon first seen by me In the course of the day at least one hundred wagons and carts passed along this road towards the south-east all laden with cotton bales and at least an equal number came towards the west either laden with casks of various dimensions or entirely empty Numerous horsemen many carriages and great numbers of persons on foot also passed to and fro on this road in the course of the day All these indications satisfied me that I must be near some large town the seat of an extensive cotton market The next consideration with me was to know how far it was to this town for which purpose I determined to travel on the road the succeeding night Lying in the woods until about eleven o'clock I rose came to the road and travelled it until within an hour of daylight at which time the country around me appeared almost wholly clear of timber and houses became much more numerous than they had been in the former part of my journey Things continued to wear this aspect until daylight when I stopped and sat down by the side of a high fence that stood beside the road After remaining here a short time a wagon laden with cotton passed along drawn by oxen whose driver a black man asked me if I was going towards town Being answered in the affirmative he then asked me if I did not wish to ride in his wagon I told him I had been out of town all night and should be very thankful to him for a ride at the same time ascending his wagon and placing myself in a secure and easy position on the bags of cotton In this manner we travelled on for about two hours when we entered the town of Savannah In my situation there was no danger of any one suspecting me to be a runaway slave for no runaway had ever been known to flee from the country and seek refuge in Savannah The man who drove the wagon passed through several of the principal streets of the city and stopped his team before a large warehouse standing on a wharf looking into the river Here I assisted my new friend to unload his cotton and when we were done he invited me to share his breakfast with him consisting of corn bread roasted potatoes and some cold boiled rice Whilst we were at our breakfast a black man came along the street and asked us if we knew where he could hire a hand to help him to work a day or two I at once replied that my master had sent me to town to hire myself out for a few weeks and that I was ready to go with him immediately The joy I felt at finding employment so overcame me that all thought of my wages was forgotten Bidding farewell to the man who had given me my breakfast and thanking him in my heart for his kindness I followed my new employer who informed me that he had engaged to remove a thousand bales of cotton from a large warehouse to the end of a wharf at which a ship lay that was taking in the cotton as a load This man was a slave but hired his time of his master at two hundred and fifty dollars a year which he he paid in monthly instalments He did what he called job work which consisted of undertaking jobs and hiring men to work under him if the job was too great to be performed by himself In the present instance he had seven or eight black men beside me all hired to help him to remove the cotton in wheel-barrows and lay it near the end of the wharf when it was taken up by sailors and carried on board the ship that was receiving it We continued working hard all day and amongst the crew of the ship was a black man with whom I resolved to become acquainted by some means Accordingly at night after we had quit our work I went to the end of the wharf against which the ship lay moored and stood there a long time waiting for the black sailor to make his appearance on deck At length my desires were gratified He came upon the deck and sat down near the main-mast with a pipe in his mouth which he was smoking with great apparent pleasure After a few minutes I spoke to him for he had not yet seen me as it appeared and when he heard my voice he rose up and came to the side of the ship near where I stood We entered into conversation together in the course of which he informed me that his home was in New-York that he had a wife and several children there but that he followed the sea for a livelihood and knew no other mode of life He also asked me where my master lived and if Georgia had always been the place of my residence I deemed this a favourable opportunity of effecting the object I had in view in seeking the acquaintance of this man and told him at once that by law and justice I was a free man but had been kidnapped near Baltimore forcibly brought to Georgia and sold there as a slave That I was now a fugitive from my master and in search of some means of getting back to my wife and children The man seemed moved by the account of my sufferings and at the close of my narrative told me he could not receive me on board the ship as the captain had given positive orders to him not to let any of the negroes of Savannah come on board lest they should steal something belonging to the ship He further told me that he was on watch and should continue on deck two hours That he was forced to take a turn of watching the ship every night for two hours but that his turn would not come the next night until after midnight I now begged him to enable me to secrete myself on board the ship previous to the time of her sailing so that I might be conveyed to Philadelphia whither the ship was bound with her load of cotton He at first received my application with great coldness and he would not do any thing contrary to the orders of the captain but before we parted he he should be glad to assist me if he could but that the execution of the plan proposed by me would be attended with great dangers if not ruin In my situation there was nothing too hazardous for me to undertake and I informed him that if he would let me hide myself in the hold of the ship amongst the bags of cotton no one should ever know that he had any knowledge of the fact and that all the danger and all the disasters that might attend the affair should fall exclusively on me He finally told me to go away and that he would think of the matter until the next day It was obvious that his heart was softened in my favour that his feelings of compassion almost impelled him to do an act in my behalf that was forbidden by his judgment and his sense of duty to his employers As the houses of the city were now closed and I was a stranger in the place I went to a wagon that stood in front of the warehouse and had been unladen of the cotton that had been brought in it and creeping into it made my bed with the driver who permitted me to share his lodgings amongst some corn tops that he had brought to feed his oxen When the morning came I went again to the ship and when the people came on deck asked them for the captain whom I should not have known by his dress which was very nearly similar to that of the sailors On being asked if he did not wish to hire a hand to help to load his ship he told me I might go to work amongst the men if I chose and he would pay me what I was worth My object was to procure employment on board the ship and not to get wages and in the course of this day I found means to enter the hold of the ship several times and examine it minutely The black sailor promised that he would not betray me and that if I could find the means of escaping on board the ship he would not disclose it At the end of three days the ship had taken in her loading and the captain in my presence that he intended to sail the day after No time was now to be lost and asking the captain what he thought I had earned he gave me three dollars which was certainly very liberal pay considering that during the whole time that I had worked for him my fare had been the same as that of the sailors who had as much as they could consume of excellent food The sailors were now busy in trimming the ship and making ready for sea and observing that this work required them to spend much time in the hold of the ship I went to the captain and told him that as he had paid me good wages and treated me well I would work with his people the residue of this day for my victuals and half a gallon of molasses which he he would give me My first object now was to get into the hold of the ship with those who were adjusting the cargo The first time the men below called for aid I went to them and being there took care to remain with them Being placed at one side of the hold for the purpose of packing the bags close to the ship's timbers I so managed as to leave a space between two of the bags large enough for a man to creep in and conceal himself This cavity was near the opening in the centre of the hold that was left to let men get down to stow away the last of the bags that were put in In this small hollow retreat amongst the bags of cotton I determined to take my passage to Philadelphia if by any means I could succeed in stealing on board the ship at night When the evening came I went to a store near the wharf and bought two jugs one that held half a gallon and the other a large stone jug holding more than three gallons When it was dark I filled my large jug with water purchased twenty pounds of pilot bread at a bakery which I tied in a large handkerchief and taking my jugs in my hand went on board the ship to receive my molasses of the captain for the labour of the day The captain was not on board and a boy gave me the molasses but under pretence of waiting to see the captain I sat down between two rows of cotton bales that were stowed on deck The night was very dark and watching a favourable opportunity when the man on deck had gone forward succeeded in placing both my jugs upon the bags of cotton that rose in the hold almost to the deck In another moment I glided down amongst the cargo and lost no time in placing my jugs in the place provided for them amongst the bales of cotton beside the lair provided for myself Soon after I had taken my station for the voyage the captain came on board and the boy reported to him that he had paid me off and dismissed me In a short time all was quiet on board the ship except the occasional tread of the man on watch I slept none at all this night the anxiety that oppressed me preventing me from taking any repose Before day the captain was on deck and gave orders to the seamen to clear the ship for sailing and to be ready to descend the river with the ebb tide which was expected to flow at sunrise I felt the motion of the ship when she got under weigh and thought the time long before I heard the breakers of the ocean surging against her sides In the place where I lay when the hatches were closed total darkness prevailed and I had no idea of the lapse of time or of the progress we made until having at one period crept out into the open space between the rows of cotton bags which I have before described I heard a man who appeared from the sound of his voice to be standing on the hatch call out and say That is Cape Hatteras I had already come out of my covert several times into the open space but the hatches were closed so tightly as to exclude all light It appeared to me that we had already been at sea a long time but as darkness was unbroken with me I could not make any computation of periods Soon after this the hatch was opened and the light was let into the hold A man descended for the purpose of examining the state of the cargo who returned in a short time The hatch was again closed and nothing of moment occurred from this time until I heard and felt the ship strike against some solid body In a short time I heard much noise and a multitude of sounds of various kinds All this satisfied me that the ship was in some port for I no longer heard the sound of the waves nor perceived the least motion in the ship At length the hatch was again opened and the light was let in upon me My anxiety now was to escape fromthe ship without being discovered by any one to accomplish which I determined to issue from the hold as soon as night came on if possible Waiting until sometime after daylight had disappeared I ventured to creep to the hatchway and raise my head above deck Seeing no one on board I crawled out of the hold and stepped on board a ship that lay alongside of that in which I had come a passenger Here a man seized me and called me a thief saying I had come to rob his ship and it was with much difficulty that I prevailed upon him to let me go He at length permitted me to go on the wharf and I once more felt myself a freeman I did not know what city I was in but as the sailors had all told me at Savannah that their ship was bound to Philadelphia I had no doubt of being in that city In going along the street a black man met me and I asked him if I was in Philadelphia This question caused the stranger to laugh loudly and he passed on without giving me any answer Soon afterwards I met an old gentleman with drab clothes on as I could see by the light of the lamps To him I propounded the same question that had been addressed a few moment before to the black man This time however I received a civil answer being told that I was in Philadelphia This gentleman seemed concerned for me either because of my wretched and ragged appearance or because I was a stranger and did not know where I was Whether for the one cause or the other I know not but he told me to follow him and led me to the house of a black man not far off whom he directed to take care of me until the morning In this house I was kindly entertained all night and when the morning came the old gentleman in drab clothes returned and brought with him an entire suit of clothes not more than half worn of which he made me a present and gave me money to buy a hat and some muslin for a couple of shirts He then turned to go away and I perceive that thee is a slave and has run away from thy master Thee can now go to work for thy living but take care that they do not catch thee again I then told him that I had been a slave and had twice run away and escaped from the state of Georgia The gentleman seemed a little incredulous of that which I told him but when I explained to him the cause of the condition in which he found me he seemed to become more than ever interested in my fate This gentleman whose name I shall not publish has always been a kind friend to me After remaining in Philadelphia a few weeks I resolved to return to my little farm in Maryland for the purpose of selling my property for as much as it would produce and of bringing my wife and children to Pennsylvania On arriving in Baltimore I went to a tavern keeper whom I had formerly supplied with vegetables from my garden This man appeared greatly surprised to see me and asked me how I had managed to escape from my master in Georgia I told him that the man who had taken me to Georgia was not my master but had kidnapped me and carried me away by violence The tavern keeper then told me that I had better leave Baltimore as soon as possible and showed me a handbill that was stuck up against the wall of his bar-room in which a hundred and fifty dollars reward was offered for my apprehension I immediately left this house and fled from Baltimore that very night When I reached my former residence I found a white man living in it whom I did not know This man on being questioned by me as to the time he had owned this place and the manner in which he had obtained possession informed me that a black man had formerly lived here but he was a runaway slave and his master had come the summer before and carried him off That the wife of the former owner of the house was also a slave and that her master had come about six weeks before the present time and taken her and her children and sold them in Baltimore to a slave-dealer from the south This man also informed me that he was not in this neighbourhood at the time the woman and her children were carried away but that he had received his information from a black woman who lived half a mile off This black woman I was well acquainted with she had been my neighbour and I knew her to be my friend She had been set free some years before by a gentleman of this neighbourhood and resided under his protection on a part of his land I immediately went to the house of this woman who could scarcely believe the evidence of her own eyes when she saw me enter her door The first words she spoke to me were Lucy and her children have all been stolen away At my request she gave me the following account of the manner in which my wife and children all of whom had been free from their birth were seized and driven into southern slavery A few weeks she after they took you away and before Lucy had so far recovered from the terror produced by that event as to remain in her house all night with her children without some other company I went one evening to stay all night with her a kindness that I always rendered her if no other person came to remain with her It was late when we went to bed perhaps eleven o'clock and after we had been asleep some time we were awakened by a loud rap at the door At first we nothing but upon the rap being several times repeated Lucy asked who was there She was then told in a voice that seemed by its sound to be that of a woman to get up and open the door adding that the person without had something to tell her that she wished to hear Lucy supposing the voice to be that of a black woman the slave of a lady living near rose and opened the door but to our astonishment instead of a woman coming in four or five men rushed into the house and immediately closed the door at which one of the men stood with his back against it until the others made a light in the fire place and proceeded deliberately to tie Lucy with a rope Search was then made in the bed for the children and I was found and dragged out This seemed to produce some consternation amongst the captors whose faces were all black but whose hair and visages were those of white men A consultation was held amongst them the object of which was to determine whether I should also be taken along with Lucy and the children or be left behind on account of the interest which my master was supposed to feel for me It was finally agreed that as it would be very dangerous to carry me off lest my old master should cause pursuit to be made after them they would leave me behind and take only Lucy and the children One of the number then it would not do to leave me behind and at liberty as I would immediately go and give intelligence of what I had seen and if the affair should be discovered by the members of the abolition society before they had time to get out of Maryland they would certainly be detected and punished for the crimes they were committing It was finally resolved to tie me with cords to one of the logs of the housegag me by tying a rope in my mouth and confining it closely at the back of my neck They immediately confined me and then took the children from the bed The oldest boy they tied to his mother and compelled them to go out of the house together The three youngest children were then taken out of bed and carried off in the hands of the men who had tied me to the log I never saw nor heard any more of Lucy or her children For myself I remained in the house the door of which was carefully closed and fastened after it was shut until the second night after my confinement without any thing to eat or drink On the second night some unknown persons came and cut the cords that bound me when I returned to my own cabin This intelligence almost deprived me of life it was the most dreadful of all the misfortunes that I had ever suffered It was now clear that some slave-dealer had come in my absence and seized my wife and children as slaves and sold them to such men as I had served in the south They had now passed into hopeless bondage and were gone forever beyond my reach I myself was advertised as a fugitive slave and was liable to be arrested at each moment and dragged back to Georgia I rushed out of my own house in despair and returned to Pennsylvania with a broken heart For the last few years I have resided about fifty miles from Philadelphia where I expect to pass the evening of my life in working hard for my subsistence without the least hope of ever again seeing my wife and children-- fearful at this day to let my place of residence be known lest even yet it may be supposed that as an article of property I am of sufficient value to be worth pursuing in my old age THE END
Frederick,NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS AN AMERICAN SLAVE WRITTEN BY HIMSELF BOSTON PUBLISHED AT THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE No CORNHILL verso Entered according to Act of Congress in the year BY FREDERERICK DOUGLASS In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of Massachusetts iii PREFACE IN the month of August I attended an antislavery convention in Nantucket at which it was my happiness to become acquainted with FREDERICK DOUGLASS the writer of the following Narrative He was a stranger to nearly every member of that body but having recently made his escape from the southern prison-house of bondage and feeling his curiosity excited to ascertain the principles and measures of the abolitionists--of whom he had heard a somewhat vague description while he was a slave--he was induced to give his attendance on the occasion alluded to though at that time a resident in New Bedford Fortunate most fortunate occurrence--fortunate for the millions of his manacled brethren yet panting for deliverance from their awful thraldom--fortunate for the cause of negro emancipation and of universal liberty--fortunate for the land of his birth which he has already done so much to save and bless--fortunate for a large circle of friends and acquaintances whose sympathy and affection he has strongly secured by the many sufferings he has endured by his virtuous traits of character by his ever-abiding remembrance of those who are in bonds as being bound with them --fortunate for the multitudes in various parts of our republic whose minds he has enlightened on the subject of slavery and who have been melted to tears by his pathos or roused to virtuous indignation by his stirring eloquence against the enslavers of men--fortunate for himself as it at once brought him into the iv field of public usefulness gave the world assurance of a MAN quickened the slumbering energies of his soul and consecrated him to the great work of breaking the rod of the oppressor and letting the oppressed go free I shall never forget his first speech at the convention--the extraordinary emotion it excited in my own mind--the powerful impression it created upon a crowded auditory completely taken by surprise--the applause which followed from the beginning to the end of his felicitous remarks I think I never hated slavery so intensely as at that moment certainly my perception of the enormous outrage which is inflicted by it on the godlike nature of its victims was rendered far more clear than ever There stood one in physical proportion and stature commanding and exact--in intellect richly endowed--in natural eloquence a prodigy--in soul manifestly created but a little lower than the angels--yet a slave ay a fugitive slave--trembling for his safety hardly daring to believe that on the American soil a single white person could be found who would befriend him at all hazards for the love of God and humanity Capable of high attainments as an intellectual and moral being--needing nothing but a comparatively small amount of cultivation to make him an ornament to society and a blessing to his race--by the law of the land by the voice of the people by the terms of the slave code he was only a piece of property a beast of burden a chattel personal nevertheless A beloved friend from New Bedford prevailed on Mr DOUGLASS to address the convention He came forward to the platform with a hesitancy and embarrassment necessarily the attendants of a sensitive mind in such a novel position After apologizing for his ignorance and reminding the audience that slavery was a poor school for the human intellect and heart v he proceeded to narrate some of the facts in his own history as a slave and in the course of his speech gave utterance to many noble thoughts and thrilling reflections As soon as he had taken his seat filled with hope and admiration I rose and declared that PATRICK HENRY of revolutionary fame never made a speech more eloquent in the cause of liberty than the one we had just listened to from the lips of that hunted fugitive So I believed at that time--such is my belief now I reminded the audience of the peril which surrounded this self-emancipated young man at the North --even in Massachusetts on the soil of the Pilgrim Fathers among the descendants of revolutionary sires and I appealed to them whether they would ever allow him to be carried back into slavery--law or no law constitution or no constitution The response was unanimous and in thunder-tones--NO Will you succor and protect him as a brother-man--a resident of the old Bay State YES shouted the whole mass with an energy so startling that the ruthless tyrants south of Mason and Dixon's line might almost have heard the mighty burst of feeling and recognized it as the pledge of an invincible determination on the part of those who gave it never to betray him that wanders but to hide the outcast and firmly to abide the consequences It was at once deeply impressed upon my mind that if Mr DOUGLASS could be persuaded to consecrate his time and talents to the promotion of the anti-slavery enterprise a powerful impetus would be given to it and a stunning blow at the same time inflicted on northern prejudice against a colored complexion I therefore endeavored to instil hope and courage into his mind in order that he might dare to engage in a vocation so anomalous and responsible for a person in his situation and I was seconded in this effort by warm-hearted friends especially by the late General vi Agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society Mr JOHN A COLLINS whose judgment in this instance entirely coincided with my own At first he could give no encouragement with unfeigned diffidence he expressed his conviction that he was not adequate to the performance of so great a task the path marked out was wholly an untrodden one he was sincerely apprehensive that he should do more harm than good After much deliberation however he consented to make a trial and ever since that period he has acted as a lecturing agent under the auspices either of the American or the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society In labors he has been most abundant and his success in combating prejudice in gaining proselytes in agitating the public mind has far surpassed the most sanguine expectations that were raised at the commencement of his brilliant career He has borne himself with gentleness and meekness yet with true manliness of character As a public speaker he excels in pathos wit comparison imitation strength of reasoning and fluency of language There is in him that union of head and heart which is indispensable to an enlightenment of the heads and a winning of the hearts of others May his strength continue to be equal to his day May he continue to grow in grace and in the knowledge of God that he may be increasingly serviceable in the cause of bleeding humanity whether at home or abroad It is certainly a very remarkable fact that one of the most efficient advocates of the slave population now before the public is a fugitive slave in the person of FREDERICK DOUGLASS and that the free colored population of the United States are as ably represented by one of their own number in the person of CHARLES LENOX REMOND whose eloquent appeals have extorted the highest applause of multitudes on both sides of the Atlantic Let the calumniators of the colored vii race despise themselves for their baseness and illiberality of spirit and henceforth cease to talk of the natural inferiority of those who require nothing but time and opportunity to attain to the highest point of human excellence It may perhaps be fairly questioned whether any other portion of the population of the earth could have endured the privations sufferings and horrors of slavery without having become more degraded in the scale of humanity than the slaves of African descent Nothing has been left undone to cripple their intellects darken their minds debase their moral nature obliterate all traces of their relationship to mankind and yet how wonderfully they have sustained the mighty load of a most frightful bondage under which they have been groaning for centuries To illustrate the effect of slavery on the white man--to show that he has no powers of endurance in such a condition superior to those of his black brother -- DANIEL O'CONNELL the distinguished advocate of universal emancipation and the mightiest champion of prostrate but not conquered Ireland relates the following anecdote in a speech delivered by him in the Conciliation Hall Dublin before the Loyal National Repeal Association March No matter said Mr O'CONNELL under what specious term it may disguise itself slavery is still hideous It has a natural an inevitable tendency to brutalize every noble faculty of man An American sailor who was cast away on the shore of Africa where he was kept in slavery for three years was at the expiration of that period found to be imbruted and stultified--he had lost all reasoning power and having forgotten his native language could only utter some savage gibberish between Arabic and English which nobody could understand and which even he himself found difficulty in pronouncing So much for the humanizing influence of THE DOMESTIC INSTITUTION viii Admitting this to have been an extraordinary case of mental deterioration it proves at least that the white slave can sink as low in the scale of humanity as the black one Mr DOUGLASS has very properly chosen to write his own Narrative in his own style and according to the best of his ability rather than to employ some one else It is therefore entirely his own production and considering how long and dark was the career he had to run as a slave--how few have been his opportunities to improve his mind since he broke his iron fetters--it is in my judgment highly creditable to his head and heart He who can peruse it without a tearful eye a heaving breast an afflicted spirit--without being filled with an unutterable abhorrence of slavery and all its abettors and animated with a determination to seek the immediate overthrow of that execrable system--without trembling for the fate of this country in the hands of a righteous God who is ever on the side of the oppressed and whose arm is not shortened that it cannot save--must have a flinty heart and be qualified to act the part of a trafficker in slaves and the souls of men I am confident that it is essentially true in all its statements that nothing has been set down in malice nothing exaggerated nothing drawn from the imagination that it comes short of the reality rather than overstates a single fact in regard to SLAVERY AS IT IS The experience of FREDERICK DOUGLASS as a slave was not a peculiar one his lot was not especially a hard one his case may be regarded as a very fair specimen of the treatment of slaves in Maryland in which State it is conceded that they are better fed and less cruelly treated than in Georgia Alabama or Louisiana Many have suffered incomparably more while very few on the plantations have suffered less than himself Yet how deplorable was his situation what terrible chastisements were ix inflicted upon his person what still more shocking outrages were perpetrated upon his mind with all his noble powers and sublime aspirations how like a brute was he treated even by those professing to have the same mind in them that was in Christ Jesus to what dreadful liabilities was he continually subjected how destitute of friendly counsel and aid even in his greatest extremities how heavy was the midnight of woe which shrouded in blackness the last ray of hope and filled the future with terror and gloom what longings after freedom took possession of his breast and how his misery augmented in proportion as he grew reflective and intelligent--thus demonstrating that a happy slave is an extinct man how he thought reasoned felt under the lash of the driver with the chains upon his limbs what perils he encountered in his endeavors to escape from his horrible doom and how signal have been his deliverance and preservation in the midst of a nation of pitiless enemies This Narrative contains many affecting incidents many passages of great eloquence and power but I think the most thrilling one of them all is the description DOUGLASS gives of his feelings as he stood soliloquizing respecting his fate and the chances of his one day being a freeman on the banks of the Chesapeake Bay--viewing the receding vessels as they flew with their white wings before the breeze and apostrophizing them as animated by the living spirit of freedom Who can read that passage and be insensible to its pathos and sublimity Compressed into it is a whole Alexandrian library of thought feeling and sentiment--all that can all that need be urged in the form of expostulation entreaty rebuke against that crime of crimes--making man the property of his fellow-man O how accursed is that system which entombs the godlike mind of man defaces the divine image reduces those who by creation were crowned x with glory and honor to a level with four-footed beasts and exalts the dealer in human flesh above all that is called God Why should its existence be prolonged one hour Is it not evil only evil and that continually What does its presence imply but the absence of all fear of God all regard for man on the part of the people of the United States Heaven speed its eternal overthrow So profoundly ignorant of the nature of slavery are many persons that they are stubbornly incredulous whenever they read or listen to any recital of the cruelties which are daily inflicted on its victims They do not deny that the slaves are held as property but that terrible fact seems to convey to their minds no idea of injustice exposure to outrage or savage barbarity Tell them of cruel scourgings of mutilations and brandings of scenes of pollution and blood of the banishment of all light and knowledge and they affect to be greatly indignant at such enormous exaggerations such wholesale misstatements such abominable libels on the character of the southern planters As if all these direful outrages were not the natural results of slavery As if it were less cruel to reduce a human being to the condition of a thing than to give him a severe flagellation or to deprive him of necessary food and clothing As if whips chains thumb-screws paddles bloodhounds overseers drivers patrols were not all indispensable to keep the slaves down and to give protection to their ruthless oppressors As if when the marriage institution is abolished concubinage adultery and incest must not necessarily abound when all the rights of humanity are annihilated any barrier remains to protect the victim from the fury of the spoiler when absolute power is assumed over life and liberty it will not be wielded with destructive sway Skeptics of this character abound in society In some few instances their incredulity arises from a want of xi reflection but generally it indicates a hatred of the light a desire to shield slavery from the assaults of its foes a contempt of the colored race whether bond or free Such will try to discredit the shocking tales of slaveholding cruelty which are recorded in this truthful Narrative but they will labor in vain Mr DOUGLASS has frankly disclosed the place of his birth the names of those who claimed ownership in his body and soul and the names also of those who committed the crimes which he has alleged against them His statements therefore may easily be disproved if they are untrue In the course of his Narrative he relates two instances of murderous cruelty--in one of which a planter deliberately shot a slave belonging to a neighboring plantation who had unintentionally gotten within his lordly domain in quest of fish and in the other an overseer blew out the brains of a slave who had fled to a stream of water to escape a bloody scourging Mr DOUGLASS states that in neither of these instances was any thing done by way of legal arrest or judicial investigation The Baltimore American of March relates a similar case of atrocity perpetrated with similar impunity--as follows--Shooting a Slave--We learn upon the authority of a letter from Charles county Maryland received by a gentleman of this city that a young man named Matthews a nephew of General Matthews and whose father it is believed holds an office at Washington killed one of the slaves upon his father's farm by shooting him The letter states that young Matthews had been left in charge of the farm that he gave an order to the servant which was disobeyed when he proceeded to the house obtained a gun and returning shot the servant He immediately the letter continues fled to his father's residence where he still remains unmolested--Let it never be forgotten that no slaveholder or xii overseer can be convicted of any outrage perpetrated on the person of a slave however diabolical it may be on the testimony of colored witnesses whether bond or free By the slave code they are adjudged to be as incompetent to testify against a white man as though they were indeed a part of the brute creation Hence there is no legal protection in fact whatever there may be in form for the slave population and any amount of cruelty may be inflicted on them with impunity Is it possible for the human mind to conceive of a more horrible state of society The effect of a religious profession on the conduct of southern masters is vividly described in the following Narrative and shown to be any thing but salutary In the nature of the case it must be in the highest degree pernicious The testimony of Mr DOUGLASS on this point is sustained by a cloud of witnesses whose veracity is unimpeachable A slaveholder's profession of Christianity is a palpable imposture He is a felon of the highest grade He is a man-stealer It is of no importance what you put in the other scale Reader are you with the man-stealers in sympathy and purpose or on the side of their down-trodden victims If with the former then are you the foe of God and man If with the latter what are you prepared to do and dare in their behalf Be faithful be vigilant be untiring in your efforts to break every yoke and let the oppressed go free Come what may--cost what it may--inscribe on the banner which you unfurl to the breeze as your religious and political motto--NO COMPROMISE WITH SLAVERY NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS WM LLOYD GARRISON BOSTON May xiii LETTER FROM WENDELL PHILLIPS ESQ BOSTON April My Dear Friend You remember the old fable of The Man and the Lion where the lion complained that he should not be so misrepresented when the lions write history I am glad the time has come when the lions write history We have been left long enough to gather character of slavery from the involuntary evidence of the masters One might indeed rest sufficiently satisfied with what it is evident must be in general the results of such a relation without seeking farther to find whether they have followed in every instance Indeed those who stare at the half-peck of corn a week and love to count the lashes on the slave's back are seldom the stuff out of which reformers and abolitionists are to be made I remember that in many were waiting for the results of the West India experiment before they could come into our ranks Those results have come long ago but alas few of that number have come with them as converts A man must be disposed to judge of emancipation by other tests than whether it has increased the produce of sugar--and to hate slavery for other reasons because it starves men and whips women--before he is ready to lay the first stone of his anti-slavery life xiv I was glad to learn in your story how early the most neglected of God's children waken to a sense of their rights and of the injustice done them Experience is a keen teacher and long before you had mastered your A B C or knew where the white sails of the Chesapeake were bound you began I see to gauge the wretchedness of the slave not by his hunger and want not by his lashes and toil but by the cruel and blighting death which gathers over his soul In connection with this there is one circumstance which makes your recollections peculiarly valuable and renders your early insight the more remarkable You come from that part of the country where we are told slavery appears with its fairest features Let us hear then what it is at its best estate--gaze on its bright side if it has one and then imagination may task her powers to add dark lines to the picture as she travels southward to that for the colored man Valley of the Shadow of Death where the Mississippi sweeps along Again we have known you long and can put the most entire confidence in your truth candor and sincerity Every one who has heard you speak has felt and I am confident every one who reads your book will feel persuaded that you give them a fair specimen of the whole truth No one-sided portrait--no wholesale complaints-- but strict justice done whenever individual kindliness has neutralized for a moment the deadly system with which it was strangely allied You have been with us too some years and can fairly compare the twilight of rights which your race enjoy at the North with that noon of night under which they labor south of Mason and Dixon's line Tell us whether after all the half-free colored man of Massachusetts is worse off than the pampered slave of the rice swamps In reading your life no one can say that we have xv unfairly picked out some rare specimens of cruelty We know that the bitter drops which even you have drained from the cup are no incidental aggravations no individual ills but such as must mingle always and necessarily in the lot of every slave They are the essential ingredients not the occasional results of the system After all I shall read your book with trembling for you Some years ago when you were beginning to tell me your real name and birthplace you may remember I stopped you and preferred to remain ignorant of all With the exception of a vague description so I continued till the other day when you read me your memoirs I hardly knew at the time whether to thank you or not for the sight of them when I reflected that it was still dangerous in Massachusetts for honest men to tell their names They say the fathers in signed the Declaration of Independence with the halter about their necks You too publish your declaration of freedom with danger compassing you around In all the broad lands which the Constitution of the United States overshadows there is no single spot--however narrow or desolate--where a fugitive slave can plant himself and say I am safe The whole armory of Northern Law has no shield for you I am free to say that in your place I should throw the MS into the fire You perhaps may tell your story in safety endeared as you are to so many warm hearts by rare gifts and a still rarer devotion of them to the service of others But it will be owing only to your labors and the fearless efforts of those who trampling the laws and Constitution of the country under their feet are determined that they will hide the outcast and that their hearths shall be spite of the law an asylum for the oppressed if some time or other the humblest may stand in our xvi streets and bear witness in safety against the cruelties of which he has been the victim Yet it is sad to think that these very throbbing hearts which welcome your story and form your best safeguard in telling it are all beating contrary to the statute in such case made and provided Go on my dear friend till you and those who like you have been saved so as by fire from the dark prison-house shall stereotype these free illegal pulses into statutes and New England cutting loose from a blood-stained Union shall glory in being the house of refuge for the oppressed--till we no longer merely hide the outcast or make a merit of standing idly by while he is hunted in our midst but consecrating anew the soil of the Pilgrims as an asylum for the oppressed proclaim our welcome to the slave so loudly that the tones shall reach every hut in the Carolinas and make the broken-hearted bondman leap up at the thought of old Massachusetts God speed the day Till then and ever Yours truly WENDELL PHILLIPS FREDERICK DOUGLASS I I WAS born in Tuckahoe near Hillsborough and about twelve miles from Easton in Talbot county Maryland I have no accurate knowledge of my age never having seen any authentic record containing it By far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday They seldom come nearer to it than planting-time harvest-time cherry-time spring-time or fall-time A want of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood The white children could tell their ages I could not tell why I ought to be deprived of the same privilege I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper and impertinent and evidence of a restless spirit The nearest estimate I can give makes me now between twenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age I come to this from hearing my master say some time during I was about seventeen years old My mother was named Harriet Bailey She was the daughter of Isaac and Betsey Bailey both colored and quite dark My mother was of a darker complexion than either my grandmother or grandfather My father was a white man He was admitted to be such by all I ever heard speak of my parentage The opinion was also whispered that my master was my father but of the correctness of this opinion I know nothing the means of knowing was withheld from me My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant--before I knew her as my mother It is a common custom in the part of Maryland from which I ran away to part children from their mothers at a very early age Frequently before the child has reached its twelfth month its mother is taken from it and hired out on some farm a considerable distance off and the child is placed under the care of an old woman too old for field labor For what this separation is done I do not know unless it be to hinder the development of the child's affection toward its mother and to blunt and destroy the natural affection of the mother for the child This is the inevitable result I never saw my mother to know her as such more than four or five times in my life and each of these times was very short in duration and at night She was hired by a Mr Stewart who lived about twelve miles from my home She made her journeys to see me in the night travelling the whole distance on foot after the performance of her day's work She was a field hand and a whipping is the penalty of not being in the field at sunrise unless a slave has special permission from his or her master to the contrary--a permission which they seldom get and one that gives to him that gives it the proud name of being a kind master I do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light of day She was with me in the night She would lie down with me and get me to sleep but long before I waked she was gone Very little communication ever took place between us Death soon ended what little we could have while she lived and with it her hardships and suffering She died when I was about seven years old on one of my master's farms near Lee's Mill I was not allowed to be present during her illness at her death or burial She was gone long before I knew any thing about it Never having enjoyed to any considerable extent her soothing presence her tender and watchful care I received the tidings of her death with much the same emotions I should have probably felt at the death of a stranger Called thus suddenly away she left me without the slightest intimation of who my father was The whisper that my master was my father may or may not be true and true or false it is of but little consequence to my purpose whilst the fact remains in all its glaring odiousness that slaveholders have ordained and by law established that the children of slave women shall in all cases follow the condition of their mothers and this is done too obviously to administer to their own lusts and make a gratification of their wicked desires profitable as well as pleasurable for by this cunning arrangement the slaveholder in cases not a few sustains to his slaves the double relation of master and father I know of such cases and it is worthy of remark that such slaves invariably suffer greater hardships and have more to contend with than others They are in the first place a constant offence to their mistress She is ever disposed to find fault with them they can seldom do any thing to please her she is never better pleased than when she sees them under the lash especially when she suspects her husband of showing to his mulatto children favors which he withholds from his black slaves The master is frequently compelled to sell this class of his slaves out of deference to the feelings of his white wife and cruel as the deed may strike any one to be for a man to sell his own children to human flesh-mongers it is often the dictate of humanity for him to do so for unless he does this he must not only whip them himself but must stand by and see one white son tie up his brother of but few shades darker complexion than himself and ply the gory lash to his naked back and if he lisp one word of disapproval it is set down to his parental partiality and only makes a bad matter worse both for himself and the slave whom he would protect and defend Every year brings with it multitudes of this class of slaves It was doubtless in consequence of a knowledge of this fact that one great statesman of the south predicted the downfall of slavery by the inevitable laws of population Whether this prophecy is ever fulfilled or not it is nevertheless plain that a very different-looking class of people are springing up at the south and are now held in slavery from those originally brought to this country from Africa and if their increase will do no other good it will do away the force of the argument that God cursed Ham and therefore American slavery is right If the lineal descendants of Ham are alone to be scripturally enslaved it is certain that slavery at the south must soon become unscriptural for thousands are ushered into the world annually who like myself owe their existence to white fathers and those fathers most frequently their own masters I have had two masters My first master's name was Anthony I do not remember his first name He was generally called Captain Anthony--a title which I presume he acquired by sailing a craft on the Chesapeake Bay He was not considered a rich slaveholder He owned two or three farms and about thirty slaves His farms and slaves were under the care of an overseer The overseer's name was Plummer Mr Plummer was a miserable drunkard a profane swearer and a savage monster He always went armed with a cowskin and a heavy cudgel I have known him to cut and slash the women's heads so horribly that even master would be enraged at his cruelty and would threaten to whip him if he did not mind himself Master however was not a humane slaveholder It required extraordinary barbarity on the part of an overseer to affect him He was a cruel man hardened by a long life of slaveholding He would at times seem to take great pleasure in whipping a slave I have often been awakened at the dawn of day by the most heart-rending shrieks of an own aunt of mine whom he used to tie up to a joist and whip upon her naked back till she was literally covered with blood No words no tears no prayers from his gory victim seemed to move his iron heart from its bloody purpose The louder she screamed the harder he whipped and where the blood ran fastest there he whipped longest He would whip her to make her scream and whip her to make her hush and not until overcome by fatigue would he cease to swing the blood-clotted cowskin I remember the first time I ever witnessed this horrible exhibition I was quite a child but I well remember it I never shall forget it whilst I remember any thing It was the first of a long series of such outrages of which I was doomed to be a witness and a participant It struck me with awful force It was the blood-stained gate the entrance to the hell of slavery through which I was about to pass It was a most terrible spectacle I wish I could commit to paper the feelings with which I beheld it This occurrence took place very soon after I went to live with my old master and under the following circumstances Aunt Hester went out one night--where or for what I do not know--and happened to be absent when my master desired her presence He had ordered her not to go out evenings and warned her that she must never let him catch her in company with a young man who was paying attention to her belonging to Colonel Lloyd The young man's name was Ned Roberts generally called Lloyd's Ned Why master was so careful of her may be safely left to conjecture She was a woman of noble form and of graceful proportions having very few equals and fewer superiors in personal appearance among the colored or white women of our neighborhood Aunt Hester had not only disobeyed his orders in going out but had been found in company with Lloyd's Ned which circumstance I found from what he said while whipping her was the chief offence Had he been a man of pure morals himself he might have been thought interested in protecting the innocence of my aunt but those who knew him will not suspect him of any such virtue Before he commenced whipping Aunt Hester he took her into the kitchen and stripped her from neck to waist leaving her neck shoulders and back entirely naked He then told her to cross her hands calling her at the same time a d--d b--h After crossing her hands he tied them with a strong rope and led her to a stool under a large hook in the joist put in for the purpose He made her get upon the stool and tied her hands to the hook She now stood fair for his infernal purpose Her arms were stretched up at their full length so that she stood upon the ends of her toes He then said to her Now you d--d b--h I'll learn you how to disobey my orders and after rolling up his sleeves be commenced to lay on the heavy cowskin and soon the warm red blood amid heart-rending shrieks from her and horrid oaths from him came dripping to the floor I was so terrified and horror-stricken at the sight that I hid myself in a closet and dared not venture out till long after the bloody transaction was over I expected it would be my turn next It was all new to me I had never seen any thing like it before I had always lived with my grandmother on the outskirts of the plantation where she was put to raise the children of the younger women I had therefore been until now out of the way of the bloody scenes that often occurred on the plantation II My master's family consisted of two sons Andrew and Richard one daughter Lucretia and her husband Captain Thomas Auld They lived in one house upon the home plantation of Colonel Edward Lloyd My master was Colonel Lloyd's clerk and superintendent He was what might be called the overseer of the overseers I spent two years of childhood on this plantation in my old master's family It was here that I witnessed the bloody transaction recorded in the first and as I received my first impressions of slavery on this plantation I will give some description of it and of slavery as it there existed The plantation is about twelve miles north of Easton in Talbot county and is situated on the border of Miles River The principal products raised upon it were tobacco corn and wheat These were raised in great abundance so that with the products of this and the other farms belonging to him he was able to keep in almost constant employment a large sloop in carrying them to market at Baltimore This sloop was named Sally Lloyd in honor of one of the colonel's daughters My master's son-in-law Captain Auld was master of the vessel she was otherwise manned by the colonel's own slaves Their names were Peter Isaac Rich and Jake These were esteemed very highly by the other slaves and looked upon as the privileged ones of the plantation for it was no small affair in the eyes of the slaves to be allowed to see Baltimore Colonel Lloyd kept from three to four hundred slaves on his home plantation and owned a large number more on the neighboring farms belonging to him The names of the farms nearest to the home plantation were Wye Town and New Design Wye Town was under the overseership of a man named Noah Willis New Design was under the overseership of a Mr Townsend The overseers of these and all the rest of the farms numbering over twenty received advice and direction from the managers of the home plantation This was the great business place It was the seat of government for the whole twenty farms All disputes among the overseers were settled here If a slave was convicted of any high misdemeanor became unmanageable or evinced a determination to run away he was brought immediately here severely whipped put on board the sloop carried to Baltimore and sold to Austin Woolfolk or some other slave-trader as a warning to the slaves remaining Here too the slaves of all the other farms received their monthly allowance of food and their yearly clothing The men and women slaves received as their monthly allowance of food eight pounds of pork or its equivalent in fish and one bushel of corn meal Their yearly clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts one pair of linen trousers like the shirts one jacket one pair of trousers for winter made of coarse negro cloth one pair of stockings and one pair of shoes the whole of which could not have cost more than seven dollars The allowance of the slave children was given to their mothers or the old women having the care of them The children unable to work in the field had neither shoes stockings jackets nor trousers given to them their clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts per year When these failed them they went naked until the next allowance-day Children from seven to ten years old of both sexes almost naked might be seen at all seasons of the year There were no beds given the slaves unless one coarse blanket be considered such and none but the men and women had these This however is not considered a very great privation They find less difficulty from the want of beds than from the want of time to sleep for when their day's work in the field is done the most of them having their washing mending and cooking to do and having few or none of the ordinary facilities for doing either of these very many of their sleeping hours are consumed in preparing for the field the coming day and when this is done old and young male and female married and single drop down side by side on one common bed--the cold damp floor--each covering himself or herself with their miserable blankets and here they sleep till they are summoned to the field by the driver's horn At the sound of this all must rise and be off to the field There must be no halting every one must be at his or her post and woe betides them who hear not this morning summons to the field for if they are not awakened by the sense of hearing they are by the sense of feeling no age nor sex finds any favor Mr Severe the overseer used to stand by the door of the quarter armed with a large hickory stick and heavy cowskin ready to whip any one who was so unfortunate as not to hear or from any other cause was prevented from being ready to start for the field at the sound of the horn Mr Severe was rightly named he was a cruel man I have seen him whip a woman causing the blood to run half an hour at the time and this too in the midst of her crying children pleading for their mother's release He seemed to take pleasure in manifesting his fiendish barbarity Added to his cruelty he was a profane swearer It was enough to chill the blood and stiffen the hair of an ordinary man to hear him talk Scarce a sentence escaped him but that was commenced or concluded by some horrid oath The field was the place to witness his cruelty and profanity His presence made it both the field of blood and of blasphemy From the rising till the going down of the sun he was cursing raving cutting and slashing among the slaves of the field in the most frightful manner His career was short He died very soon after I went to Colonel Lloyd's and he died as he lived uttering with his dying groans bitter curses and horrid oaths His death was regarded by the slaves as the result of a merciful providence Mr Severe's place was filled by a Mr Hopkins He was a very different man He was less cruel less profane and made less noise than Mr Severe His course was characterized by no extraordinary demonstrations of cruelty He whipped but seemed to take no pleasure in it He was called by the slaves a good overseer The home plantation of Colonel Lloyd wore the appearance of a country village All the mechanical operations for all the farms were performed here The shoemaking and mending the blacksmithing cartwrighting coopering weaving and grain-grinding were all performed by the slaves on the home plantation The whole place wore a business-like aspect very unlike the neighboring farms The number of houses too conspired to give it advantage over the neighboring farms It was called by the slaves the Great House Farm Few privileges were esteemed higher by the slaves of the out-farms than that of being selected to do errands at the Great House Farm It was associated in their minds with greatness A representative could not be prouder of his election to a seat in the American Congress than a slave on one of the out-farms would be of his election to do errands at the Great House Farm They regarded it as evidence of great confidence reposed in them by their overseers and it was on this account as well as a constant desire to be out of the field from under the driver's lash that they esteemed it a high privilege one worth careful living for He was called the smartest and most trusty fellow who had this honor conferred upon him the most frequently The competitors for this office sought as diligently to please their overseers as the office-seekers in the political parties seek to please and deceive the people The same traits of character might be seen in Colonel Lloyd's slaves as are seen in the slaves of the political parties The slaves selected to go to the Great House Farm for the monthly allowance for themselves and their fellow-slaves were peculiarly enthusiastic While on their way they would make the dense old woods for miles around reverberate with their wild songs revealing at once the highest joy and the deepest sadness They would compose and sing as they went along consulting neither time nor tune The thought that came up came out--if not in the word in the sound --and as frequently in the one as in the other They would sometimes sing the most pathetic sentiment in the most rapturous tone and the most rapturous sentiment in the most pathetic tone Into all of their songs they would manage to weave something of the Great House Farm Especially would they do this when leaving home They would then sing most exultingly the following words-- I am going away to the Great House Farm O yea O yea O This they would sing as a chorus to words which to many would seem unmeaning jargon but which nevertheless were full of meaning to themselves I have sometimes thought that the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress some minds with the horrible character of slavery than the reading of whole volumes of philosophy on the subject could do I did not when a slave understand the deep meaning of those rude and apparently incoherent songs I was myself within the circle so that I neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear They told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension they were tones loud long and deep they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish Every tone was a testimony against slavery and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirit and filled me with ineffable sadness I have frequently found myself in tears while hearing them The mere recurrence to those songs even now afflicts me and while I am writing these lines an expression of feeling has already found its way down my cheek To those songs I trace my first glimmering conception of the dehumanizing character of slavery I can never get rid of that conception Those songs still follow me to deepen my hatred of slavery and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds If any one wishes to be impressed with the soul-killing effects of slavery let him go to Colonel Lloyd's plantation and on allowance-day place himself in the deep pine woods and there let him in silence analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his soul--and if he is not thus impressed it will only be because there is no flesh in his obdurate heart I have often been utterly astonished since I came to the north to find persons who could speak of the singing among slaves as evidence of their contentment and happiness It is impossible to conceive of a greater mistake Slaves sing most when they are most unhappy The songs of the slave represent the sorrows of his heart and he is relieved by them only as an aching heart is relieved by its tears At least such is my experience I have often sung to drown my sorrow but seldom to express my happiness Crying for joy and singing for joy were alike uncommon to me while in the jaws of slavery The singing of a man cast away upon a desolate island might be as appropriately considered as evidence of contentment and happiness as the singing of a slave the songs of the one and of the other are prompted by the same emotion III COLONEL LLOYD kept a large and finely cultivated garden which afforded almost constant employment for four men besides the chief gardener Mr M'Durmond This garden was probably the greatest attraction of the place During the summer months people came from far and near--from Baltimore Easton and Annapolis--to see it It abounded in fruits of almost every description from the hardy apple of the north to the delicate orange of the south This garden was not the least source of trouble on the plantation Its excellent fruit was quite a temptation to the hungry swarms of boys as well as the older slaves belonging to the colonel few of whom had the virtue or the vice to resist it Scarcely a day passed during the summer but that some slave had to take the lash for stealing fruit The colonel had to resort to all kinds of stratagems to keep his slaves out of the garden The last most successful one was that of tarring his fence all around after which if a slave was caught with any tar upon his person it was deemed sufficient proof that he had either been into the garden or had tried to get in In either case he was severely whipped by the chief gardener This plan worked well the slaves became as fearful of tar as of the lash They seemed to realize the impossibility of touching tar without being defiled The colonel also kept a splendid riding equi His stable and carriage-house presented the appearance of some of our large city livery establishments His horses were of the finest form and noblest blood His carriage-house contained three splendid coaches three or four gigs besides dearborns and barouches of the most fashionable style This establishment was under the care of two slaves-- old Barney and young Barney--father and son To attend to this establishment was their sole work But it was by no means an easy employment for in nothing was Colonel Lloyd more particular than in the management of his horses The slightest inattention to these was unpardonable and was visited upon those under whose care they were placed with the severest punishment no excuse could shield them if the colonel only suspected any want of attention to his horses--a supposition which he frequently indulged and one which of course made the office of old and young Barney a very trying one They never knew when they were safe from punishment They were frequently whipped when least deserving and escaped whipping when most deserving it Every thing depended upon the looks of the horses and the state of Colonel Lloyd's own mind when his horses were brought to him for use If a horse did not move fast enough or hold his head high enough it was owing to some fault of his keepers It was painful to stand near the stable-door and hear the various complaints against the keepers when a horse was taken out for use This horse has not had proper attention He has not been sufficiently rubbed and curried or he has not been properly fed his food was too wet or too dry he got it too soon or too late he was too hot or too cold he had too much hay and not enough of grain or he had too much grain and not enough of hay instead of old Barney's attending to the horse he had very improperly left it to his son To all these complaints no matter how unjust the slave must answer never a word Colonel Lloyd could not brook any contradiction from a slave When he spoke a slave must stand listen and tremble and such was literally the case I have seen Colonel Lloyd make old Barney a man between fifty and sixty years of age uncover his bald head kneel down upon the cold damp ground and receive upon his naked and toil-worn shoulders more than thirty lashes at the time Colonel Lloyd had three sons--Edward Murray and Daniel--and three sons-in-law Mr Winder Mr Nicholson and Mr Lowndes All of these lived at the Great House Farm and enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they pleased from old Barney down to William Wilkes the coach-driver I have seen Winder make one of the house-servants stand off from him a suitable distance to be touched with the end of his whip and at every stroke raise great ridges upon his back To describe the wealth of Colonel Lloyd would be almost equal to describing the riches of Job He kept from ten to fifteen house-servants He was said to own a thousand slaves and I think this estimate quite within the truth Colonel Lloyd owned so many that he did not know them when he saw them nor did all the slaves of the out-farms know him It is reported of him that while riding along the road one day he met a colored man and addressed him in the usual manner of speaking to colored people on the public highways of the south Well boy whom do you belong to To Colonel Lloyd replied the slave Well does the colonel treat you well No sir was the ready reply What does he work you too hard Yea sir Well don't he give you enough to eat Yes sir he gives me enough such as it is The colonel after ascertaining where the slave belonged rode on the man also went on about his business not dreaming that be had been conversing with his master He thought said and heard nothing more of the matter until two or three weeks afterwards The poor man was then informed by his overseer that for having found fault with his master he was now to be sold to a Georgia trader He was immediately chained and handcuffed and thus without a moment's warning he was snatched away and forever sundered from his family and friends by a hand more unrelenting than death This is the penalty of telling the truth of telling the simple truth in answer to a series of plain questions It is partly in consequence of such facts that slaves when inquired of as to their condition and the character of their masters almost universally say they are contented and that their masters are kind The slaveholders have been known to send in spies among their slaves to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition The frequency of this has had the effect to establish among the slaves the maxim that a still tongue makes a wise head They suppress the truth rather than take the consequences of telling it and in so doing prove themselves a part of the human family If they have any thing to say of their masters it is generally in their masters' favor especially when speaking to an untried man I have been frequently asked when a slave if I had a kind master and do not remember ever to have given a negative answer nor did I in pursuing this course consider myself as uttering what was absolutely false for I always measured the kindness of my master by the standard of kindness set up among slaveholders around us Moreover slaves are like other people and imbibe prejudices quite common to others They think their own better than that of others Many under the influence of this prejudice think their own masters are better than the masters of other slaves and this too in some cases when the very reverse is true Indeed it is not uncommon for slaves even to fall out and quarrel among themselves about the relative goodness of their masters each contending for the superior goodness of his own over that of the others At the very same time they mutually execrate their masters when viewed separately It was so on our plantation When Colonel Lloyd's slaves met the slaves of Jacob Jepson they seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters Colonel Lloyd's slaves contending that he was the richest and Mr Jepson's slaves that he was the smartest and most of a man Colonel Lloyd's slaves would boast his ability to buy and sell Jacob Jepson Mr Jepson's slaves would boast his ability to whip Colonel Lloyd These quarrels would almost always end in a fight between the parties and those that whipped were supposed to have gained the point at issue They seemed to think that the greatness of their masters was transferable to themselves It was considered as being bad enough to be a slave but to be a poor man's slave was deemed a disgrace indeed IV MR HOPKINS remained but a short time in the office of overseer Why his career was so short I do not know but suppose he lacked the necessary severity to suit Colonel Lloyd Mr Hopkins was succeeded by Mr Austin Gore a man possessing in an eminent degree all those traits of character indispensable to what is called a first-rate overseer Mr Gore had served Colonel Lloyd in the capacity of overseer upon one of the out-farms and had shown himself worthy of the high station of overseer upon the home or Great House Farm Mr Gore was proud ambitious and persevering He was artful cruel and obdurate He was just the man for such a place and it was just the place for such a man It afforded scope for the full exercise of all his powers and he seemed to be perfectly at home in it He was one of those who could torture the slightest look word or gesture on the part of the slave into impudence and would treat it accordingly There must be no answering back to him no explanation was allowed a slave showing himself to have been wrongfully accused Mr Gore acted fully up to the maxim laid down by slaveholders--It is better that a dozen slaves suffer under the lash than that the overseer should be convicted in the presence of the slaves of having been at fault No matter how innocent a slave might be--it availed him nothing when accused by Mr Gore of any misdemeanor To be accused was to be convicted and to be convicted was to be punished the one always following the other with immutable certainty To escape punishment was to escape accusation and few slaves had the fortune to do either under the overseership of Mr Gore He was just proud enough to demand the most debasing homage of the slave and quite servile enough to crouch himself at the feet of the master He was ambitious enough to be contented with nothing short of the highest rank of overseers and persevering enough to reach the height of his ambition He was cruel enough to inflict the severest punishment artful enough to descend to the lowest trickery and obdurate enough to be insensible to the voice of a reproving conscience He was of all the overseers the most dreaded by the slaves His presence was painful his eye flashed confusion and seldom was his sharp shrill voice heard without producing horror and trembling in their ranks Mr Gore was a grave man and though a young man he indulged in no jokes said no funny words seldom smiled His words were in perfect keeping with his looks and his looks were in perfect keeping with his words Overseers will sometimes indulge in a witty word even with the slaves not so with Mr Gore He spoke but to command and commanded but to be obeyed he dealt sparingly with his words and bountifully with his whip never using the former where the latter would answer as well When he whipped he seemed to do so from a sense of duty and feared no consequences He did nothing reluctantly no matter how disagreeable always at his post never inconsistent He never promised but to fulfil He was in a word a man of the most inflexible firmness and stone-like coolness His savage barbarity was equalled only by the consummate coolness with which he committed the grossest and most savage deeds upon the slaves under his charge Mr Gore once undertook to whip one of Colonel Lloyd's slaves by the name of Demby He had given Demby but few stripes when to get rid of the scourging he ran and plunged himself into a creek and stood there at the depth of his shoulders refusing to come out Mr Gore told him that he would give him three calls and that if he did not come out at the third call he would shoot him The first call was given Demby made no response but stood his ground The second and third calls were given with the same result Mr Gore then without consultation or deliberation with any one not even giving Demby an additional call raised his musket to his face taking deadly aim at his standing victim and in an instant poor Demby was no more His mangled body sank out of sight and blood and brains marked the water where he had stood A thrill of horror flashed through every soul upon the plantation excepting Mr Gore He alone seemed cool and collected He was asked by Colonel Lloyd and my old master why he resorted to this extraordinary expedient His reply was as well as I can remember that Demby had become unmanageable He was setting a dangerous example to the other slaves--one which if suffered to pass without some such demonstration on his part would finally lead to the total subversion of all rule and order upon the plantation He argued that if one slave refused to be corrected and escaped with his life the other slaves would soon copy the example the result of which would be the freedom of the slaves and the enslavement of the whites Mr Gore's defence was satisfactory He was continued in his station as overseer upon the home plantation His fame as an overseer went abroad His horrid crime was not even submitted to judicial investigation It was committed in the presence of slaves and they of course could neither institute a suit nor testify against him and thus the guilty perpetrator of one of the bloodiest and most foul murders goes unwhipped of justice and uncensured by the community in which he lives Mr Gore lived in St Michael's Talbot county Maryland when I left there and if he is still alive he very probably lives there now and if so he is now as he was then as highly esteemed and as much respected as though his guilty soul had not been stained with his brother's blood I speak advisedly when I say this--that killing a slave or any colored person in Talbot county Maryland is not treated as a crime either by the courts or the community Mr Thomas Lanman of St Michael's killed two slaves one of whom he killed with a hatchet by knocking his brains out He used to boast of the commission of the awful and bloody deed I have heard him do so laughingly saying among other things that he was the only benefactor of his country in the company and that when others would do as much as he had done we should be relieved of the d--d niggers The wife of Mr Giles Hick living but a short distance from where I used to live murdered my wife's cousin a young girl between fifteen and sixteen years of age mangling her person in the most horrible manner breaking her nose and breastbone with a stick so that the poor girl expired in a few hours afterward She was immediately buried but had not been in her untimely grave but a few hours before she was taken up and examined by the coroner who decided that she had come to her death by severe beating The offence for which this girl was thus murdered was this-- She had been set that night to mind Mrs Hick's baby and during the night she fell asleep and the baby cried She having lost her rest for several nights previous did not hear the crying They were both in the room with Mrs Hicks Mrs Hicks finding the girl slow to move jumped from her bed seized an oak stick of wood by the fireplace and with it broke the girl's nose and breastbone and thus ended her life I will not say that this most horrid murder produced no sensation in the community It did produce sensation but not enough to bring the murderess to punishment There was a warrant issued for her arrest but it was never served Thus she escaped not only punishment but even the pain of being arraigned before a court for her horrid crime Whilst I am detailing bloody deeds which took place during my stay on Colonel Lloyd's plantation I will briefly narrate another which occurred about the same time as the murder of Demby by Mr Gore Colonel Lloyd's slaves were in the habit of spending a part of their nights and Sundays in fishing for oysters and in this way made up the deficiency of their scanty allowance An old man belonging to Colonel Lloyd while thus engaged happened to get beyond the limits of Colonel Lloyd's and on the premises of Mr Beal Bondly At this trespass Mr Bondly took offence and with his musket came down to the shore and blew its deadly contents into the poor old man Mr Bondly came over to see Colonel Lloyd the next day whether to pay him for his property or to justify himself in what he had done I know not At any rate this whole fiendish transaction was soon hushed up There was very little said about it at all and nothing done It was a common saying even among little white boys that it was worth a half-cent to kill a nigger and a half-cent to bury one V As to my own treatment while I lived on Colonel Lloyd's plantation it was very similar to that of the other slave children I was not old enough to work in the field and there being little else than field work to do I had a great deal of leisure time The most I had to do was to drive up the cows at evening keep the fowls out of the garden keep the front yard clean and run of errands for my old master's daughter Mrs Lucretia Auld The most of my leisure time I spent in helping Master Daniel Lloyd in finding his birds after he had shot them My connection with Master Daniel was of some advantage to me He became quite attached to me and was a sort of protector of me He would not allow the older boys to impose upon me and would divide his cakes with me I was seldom whipped by my old master and suffered little from any thing else than hunger and cold I suffered much from hunger but much more from cold In hottest summer and coldest winter I was kept almost naked--no shoes no stockings no jacket no trousers nothing on but a coarse tow linen shirt reaching only to my knees I had no bed I must have perished with cold but that the coldest nights I used to steal a bag which was used for carrying corn to the mill I would crawl into this bag and there sleep on the cold damp clay floor with my head in and feet out My feet have been so cracked with the frost that the pen with which I am writing might be laid in the gashes We were not regularly allowanced Our food was coarse corn meal boiled This was called mush It was put into a large wooden tray or trough and set down upon the ground The children were then called like so many pigs and like so many pigs they would come and devour the mush some with oyster-shells others with pieces of shingle some with naked hands and none with spoons He that ate fastest got most he that was strongest secured the best place and few left the trough satisfied I was probably between seven and eight years old when I left Colonel Lloyd's plantation I left it with joy I shall never forget the ecstasy with which I received the intelligence that my old master Anthony had determined to let me go to Baltimore to live with Mr Hugh Auld brother to my old master's son-in-law Captain Thomas Auld I received this information about three days before my departure They were three of the happiest days I ever enjoyed I spent the most part of all these three days in the creek washing off the plantation scurf and preparing myself for my departure The pride of appearance which this would indicate was not my own I spent the time in washing not so much because I wished to but because Mrs Lucretia had told me I must get all the dead skin off my feet and knees before I could go to Baltimore for the people in Baltimore were very cleanly and would laugh at me if I looked dirty Besides she was going to give me a pair or trousers which I should not put on unless I got all the dirt off me The thought of owning a pair of trousers was great indeed It was almost a sufficient motive not only to make me take off what would be called by pig-drovers the mange but the skin itself I went at it in good earnest working for the first time with the hope of reward The ties that ordinarily bind children to their homes were all suspended in my case I found no severe trial in my departure My home was charmless it was not home to me on parting from it I could not feel that I was leaving any thing which I could have enjoyed by staying My mother was dead my grandmother lived far off so that I seldom saw her I had two sisters and one brother that lived in the same house with me but the early separation of us from our mother had well nigh blotted the fact of our relationship from our memories I looked for home elsewhere and was confident of finding none which I should relish less than the one which I was leaving If however I found in my new home hardship hunger whipping and nakedness I had the consolation that I should not have escaped any one of them by staying Having already had more than a taste of them in the house of my old master and having endured them there I very naturally inferred my ability to endure them elsewhere and especially at Baltimore for I had something of the feeling about Baltimore that is expressed in the proverb that being hanged in England is preferable to dying a natural death in Ireland I had the strongest desire to see Baltimore Cousin Tom though not fluent in speech had inspired me with that desire by his eloquent description of the place I could never point out any thing at the Great House no matter how beautiful or powerful but that he had seen something at Baltimore far exceeding both in beauty and strength the object which I pointed out to him Even the Great House itself with all its pictures was far inferior to many buildings in Baltimore So strong was my desire that I thought a gratification of it would fully compensate for whatever loss of comforts I should sustain by the exchange I left without a regret and with the highest hopes of future happiness We sailed out of Miles River for Baltimore on a Saturday morning I remember only the day of the week for at that time I had no knowledge of the days of the month nor the months of the year On setting sail I walked aft and gave to Colonel Lloyd's plantation what I hoped would be the last look I then placed myself in the bows of the sloop and there spent the remainder of the day in looking ahead interesting myself in what was in the distance rather than in things nearby or behind In the afternoon of that day we reached Annapolis the capital of the State We stopped but a few moments so that I had no time to go on shore It was the first large town that I had ever seen and though it would look small compared with some of our New England factory villages I thought it a wonderful place for its size--more imposing even than the Great House Farm We arrived at Baltimore early on Sunday morning landing at Smith's Wharf not far from Bowley's Wharf We had on board the sloop a large flock of sheep and after aiding in driving them to the slaughterhouse of Mr Curtis on Louden Slater's Hill I was conducted by Rich one of the hands belonging on board of the sloop to my new home in Alliciana Street near Mr Gardner's ship-yard on Fells Point Mr and Mrs Auld were both at home and met me at the door with their little son Thomas to take care of whom I had been given And here I saw what I had never seen before it was a white face beaming with the most kindly emotions it was the face of my new mistress Sophia Auld I wish I could describe the rapture that flashed through my soul as I beheld it It was a new and strange sight to me brightening up my pathway with the light of happiness Little Thomas was told there was his Freddy--and I was told to take care of little Thomas and thus I entered upon the duties of my new home with the most cheering prospect ahead I look upon my departure from Colonel Lloyd's plantation as one of the most interesting events of my life It is possible and even quite probable that but for the mere circumstance of being removed from that plantation to Baltimore I should have to-day instead of being here seated by my own table in the enjoyment of freedom and the happiness of home writing this Narrative been confined in the galling chains of slavery Going to live at Baltimore laid the foundation and opened the gateway to all my subsequent prosperity I have ever regarded it as the first plain manifestation of that kind providence which has ever since attended me and marked my life with so many favors I regarded the selection of myself as being somewhat remarkable There were a number of slave children that might have been sent from the plantation to Baltimore There were those younger those older and those of the same age I was chosen from among them all and was the first last and only choice I may be deemed superstitions and even egotistical in regarding this event as a special interposition of divine Providence in my favor But I should be false to the earliest sentiments of my soul if I suppressed the opinion I prefer to be true to myself even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others rather than to be false and incur my own abhorrence From my earliest recollection I date the entertainment of a deep conviction that slavery would not always be able to hold me within its foul embrace and in the darkest hours of my career in slavery this living word of faith and spirit of hope departed not from me but remained like ministering angels to cheer me through the gloom This good spirit was from God and to him I offer thanksgiving and praise VI My new mistress proved to be all she appeared when I first met her at the door--a woman of the kindest heart and finest feelings She had never had a slave under her control previously to myself and prior to her marriage she had been dependent upon her own industry for a living She was by trade a weaver and by constant application to her business she had been in a good degree preserved from the blighting and dehumanizing effects of slavery I was utterly astonished at her goodness I scarcely knew how to behave towards her She was entirely unlike any other white woman I had ever seen I could not approach her as I was accustomed to approach other white ladies My early instruction was all out of place The crouching servility usually so acceptable a quality in a slave did not answer when manifested toward her Her favor was not gained by it she seemed to be disturbed by it She did not deem it impudent or unmannerly for a slave to look her in the face The meanest slave was put fully at ease in her presence and none left without feeling better for having seen her Her face was made of heavenly smiles and her voice of tranquil music But alas this kind heart had but a short time to remain such The fatal poison of irresponsible power was already in her hands and soon commenced its infernal work That cheerful eye under the influence of slavery soon became red with rage that voice made all of sweet accord changed to one of harsh and horrid discord and that angelic face gave place to that of a demon Very soon after I went to live with Mr and Mrs Auld she very kindly commenced to teach me the A B C After I had learned this she assisted me in learning to spell words of three or four letters Just at this point of my progress Mr Auld found out what was going on and at once forbade Mrs Auld to instruct me further telling her among other things that it was unlawful as well as unsafe to teach a slave to read To use his own words further he said If you give a nigger an inch he will take an ell A nigger should know nothing but to obey his master--to do as he is told to do Learning would spoil the best nigger in the world Now said he if you teach that nigger speaking of myself how to read there would be no keeping him It would forever unfit him to be a slave He would at once become unmanageable and of no value to his master As to himself it could do him no good but a great deal of harm It would make him discontented and unhappy These words sank deep into my heart stirred up sentiments within that lay slumbering and called into existence an entirely new train of thought It was a new and special revelation explaining dark and mysterious things with which my youthful understanding had struggled but struggled in vain I now understood what had been to me a most perplexing difficulty--to wit the white man's power to enslave the black man It was a grand achievement and I prized it highly From that moment I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom It was just what I wanted and I got it at a time when I the least expected it Whilst I was saddened by the thought of losing the aid of my kind mistress I was gladdened by the invaluable instruction which by the merest accident I had gained from my master Though conscious of the difficulty of learning without a teacher I set out with high hope and a fixed purpose at whatever cost of trouble to learn how to read The very decided manner with which he spoke and strove to impress his wife with the evil consequences of giving me instruction served to convince me that he was deeply sensible of the truths he was uttering It gave me the best assurance that I might rely with the utmost confidence on the results which he said would flow from teaching me to read What he most dreaded that I most desired What he most loved that I most hated That which to him was a great evil to be carefully shunned was to me a great good to be diligently sought and the argument which he so warmly urged against my learning to read only served to inspire me with a desire and determination to learn In learning to read I owe almost as much to the bitter opposition of my master as to the kindly aid of my mistress I acknowledge the benefit of both I had resided but a short time in Baltimore before I observed a marked difference in the treatment of slaves from that which I had witnessed in the country A city slave is almost a freeman compared with a slave on the plantation He is much better fed and clothed and enjoys privileges altogether unknown to the slave on the plantation There is a vestige of decency a sense of shame that does much to curb and check those outbreaks of atrocious cruelty so commonly enacted upon the plantation He is a desperate slaveholder who will shock the humanity of his non-slaveholding neighbors with the cries of his lacerated slave Few are willing to incur the odium attaching to the reputation of being a cruel master and above all things they would not be known as not giving a slave enough to eat Every city slaveholder is anxious to have it known of him that he feeds his slaves well and it is due to them to say that most of them do give their slaves enough to eat There are however some painful exceptions to this rule Directly opposite to us on Philpot Street lived Mr Thomas Hamilton He owned two slaves Their names were Henrietta and Mary Henrietta was about twenty-two years of age Mary was about fourteen and of all the mangled and emaciated creatures I ever looked upon these two were the most so His heart must be harder than stone that could look upon these unmoved The head neck and shoulders of Mary were literally cut to pieces I have frequently felt her head and found it nearly covered with festering sores caused by the lash of her cruel mistress I do not know that her master ever whipped her but I have been an eye-witness to the cruelty of Mrs Hamilton I used to be in Mr Hamilton's house nearly every day Mrs Hamilton used to sit in a large chair in the middle of the room with a heavy cowskin always by her side and scarce an hour passed during the day but was marked by the blood of one of these slaves The girls seldom passed her without her saying Move faster you black gip at the same time giving them a blow with the cowskin over the head or shoulders often drawing the blood She would then say Take that you black gip-- continuing If you don't move faster I'll move you Added to the cruel lashings to which these slaves were subjected they were kept nearly half-starved They seldom knew what it was to eat a full meal I have seen Mary contending with the pigs for the offal thrown into the street So much was Mary kicked and cut to pieces that she was oftener called pecked than by her name VII I LIVED in Master Hugh's family about seven years During this time I succeeded in learning to read and write In accomplishing this I was compelled to resort to various stratagems I had no regular teacher My mistress who had kindly commenced to instruct me had in compliance with the advice and direction of her husband not only ceased to instruct but had set her face against my being instructed by any one else It is due however to my mistress to say of her that she did not adopt this course of treatment immediately She at first lacked the depravity indispensable to shutting me up in mental darkness It was at least necessary for her to have some training in the exercise of irresponsible power to make her equal to the task of treating me as though I were a brute My mistress was as I have said a kind and tender-hearted woman and in the simplicity of her soul she commenced when I first went to live with her to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another In entering upon the duties of a slaveholder she did not seem to perceive that I sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel and that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong but dangerously so Slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me When I went there she was a pious warm and tender-hearted woman There was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear She had bread for the hungry clothes for the naked and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach Slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities Under its influence the tender heart became stone and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of tiger-like fierceness The first step in her downward course was in her ceasing to instruct me She now commenced to practise her husband's precepts She finally became even more violent in her opposition than her husband himself She was not satisfied with simply doing as well as he had commanded she seemed anxious to do better Nothing seemed to make her more angry than to see me with a newspaper She seemed to think that here lay the danger I have had her rush at me with a face made all up of fury and snatch from me a newspaper in a manner that fully revealed her apprehension She was an apt woman and a little experience soon demonstrated to her satisfaction that education and slavery were incompatible with each other From this time I was most narrowly watched If I was in a separate room any considerable length of time I was sure to be suspected of having a book and was at once called to give an account of myself All this however was too late The first step had been taken Mistress in teaching me the alphabet had given me the inch and no precaution could prevent me from taking the ell The plan which I adopted and the one by which I was most successful was that of making friends of all the little white boys whom I met in the street As many of these as I could I converted into teachers With their kindly aid obtained at different times and in different places I finally succeeded in learning to read When I was sent of errands I always took my book with me and by going one part of my errand quickly I found time to get a lesson before my return I used also to carry bread with me enough of which was always in the house and to which I was always welcome for I was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood This bread I used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins who in return would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them but prudence forbids--not that it would injure me but it might embarrass them for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this Christian country It is enough to say of the dear little fellows that they lived on Philpot Street very near Durgin and Bailey's ship-yard I used to talk this matter of slavery over with them I would sometimes say to them I wished I could be as free as they would be when they got to be men You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one but I am a slave for life Have not I as good a right to be free as you have These words used to trouble them they would express for me the liveliest sympathy and console me with the hope that something would occur by which I might be free I was now about twelve years old and the thought of being a slave for life began to bear heavily upon my heart Just about this time I got hold of a book entitled The Columbian Orator Every opportunity I got I used to read this book Among much of other interesting matter I found in it a dialogue between a master and his slave The slave was represented as having run away from his master three times The dialogue represented the conversation which took place between them when the slave was retaken the third time In this dialogue the whole argument in behalf of slavery was brought forward by the master all of which was disposed of by the slave The slave was made to say some very smart as well as impressive things in reply to his master--things which had the desired though unexpected effect for the conversation resulted in the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part of the master In the same book I met with one of Sheridan's mighty speeches on and in behalf of Catholic emancipation These were choice documents to me I read them over and over again with unabated interest They gave tongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul which had frequently flashed through my mind and died away for want of utterance The moral which I gained from the dialogue was the power of truth over the conscience of even a slaveholder What I got from Sheridan was a bold denunciation of slavery and a powerful vindication of human rights The reading of these documents enabled me to utter my thoughts and to meet the arguments brought forward to sustain slavery but while they relieved me of one difficulty they brought on another even more painful than the one of which I was relieved The more I read the more I was led to abhor and detest my enslavers I could regard them in no other light than a band of successful robbers who had left their homes and gone to Africa and stolen us from our homes and in a strange land reduced us to slavery I loathed them as being the meanest as well as the most wicked of men As I read and contemplated the subject behold that very discontentment which Master Hugh had predicted would follow my learning to read had already come to torment and sting my soul to unutterable anguish As I writhed under it I would at times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than a blessing It had given me a view of my wretched condition without the remedy It opened my eyes to the horrible pit but to no ladder upon which to get out In moments of agony I envied my fellow-slaves for their stupidity I have often wished myself a beast I preferred the condition of the meanest reptile to my own Any thing no matter what to get rid of thinking It was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me There was no getting rid of it It was pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing animate or inanimate The silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal wakefulness Freedom now appeared to disappear no more forever It was heard in every sound and seen in every thing It was ever present to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition I saw nothing without seeing it I heard nothing without hearing it and felt nothing without feeling it It looked from every star it smiled in every calm breathed in every wind and moved in every storm I often found myself regretting my own existence and wishing myself dead and but for the hope of being free I have no doubt but that I should have killed myself or done something for which I should have been killed While in this state of mind I was eager to hear any one speak of slavery I was a ready listener Every little while I could hear something about the abolitionists It was some time before I found what the word meant It was always used in such connections as to make it an interesting word to me If a slave ran away and succeeded in getting clear or if a slave killed his master set fire to a barn or did any thing very wrong in the mind of a slaveholder it was spoken of as the fruit of abolition Hearing the word in this connection very often I set about learning what it meant The dictionary afforded me little or no help I found it was the act of abolishing but then I did not know what was to be abolished Here I was perplexed I did not dare to ask any one about its meaning for I was satisfied that it was something they wanted me to know very little about After a patient waiting I got one of our city papers containing an account of the number of petitions from the north praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia and of the slave trade between the States From this time I understood the words abolition and abolitionist and always drew near when that word was spoken expecting to bear something of importance to myself and fellow-slaves The light broke in upon me by degrees I went one day down on the wharf of Mr Waters and seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow of stone I went unasked and helped them When we had finished one of them came to me and asked me if I were a slave I told him I was He asked Are ye a slave for life I told him that I was The good Irishman seemed to be deeply affected by the statement He said to the other that it was a pity so fine a little fellow as myself should be a slave for life He said it was a shame to hold me They both advised me to run away to the north that I should find friends there and that I should be free I pretended not to be interested in what they said and treated them as if I did not understand them for I feared they might be treacherous White men have been known to encourage slaves to escape and then to get the reward catch them and return them to their masters I was afraid that these seemingly good men might use me so but I nevertheless remembered their advice and from that time I resolved to run away I looked forward to a time at which it would be safe for me to escape I was too young to think of doing so immediately besides I wished to learn how to write as I might have occasion to write my own pass I consoled myself with the hope that I should one day find a good chance Meanwhile I would learn to write The idea as to how I might learn to write was suggested to me by being in Durgin and Bailey's ship-yard and frequently seeing the ship carpenters after hewing and getting a piece of timber ready for use write on the timber the name of that part of the ship for which it was intended When a piece of timber was intended for the larboard side it would be marked thus--L When a piece was for the starboard side it would be marked thus-- S A piece for the larboard side forward would be marked thus--L F When a piece was for starboard side forward it would be marked thus--S F For larboard aft it would be marked thus--L A For starboard aft it would be marked thus--S A I soon learned the names of these letters and for what they were intended when placed upon a piece of timber in the ship-yard I immediately commenced copying them and in a short time was able to make the four letters named After that when I met with any boy who I knew could write I would tell him I could write as well as he The next word would be I don't believe you Let me see you try it I would then make the letters which I had been so fortunate as to learn and ask him to beat that In this way I got a good many lessons in writing which it is quite possible I should never have gotten in any other way During this time my copy-book was the board fence brick wall and pavement my pen and ink was a lump of chalk With these I learned mainly how to write I then commenced and continued copying the Italics in Webster's Spelling Book until I could make them all without looking on the book By this time my little Master Thomas had gone to school and learned how to write and had written over a number of copy-books These had been brought home and shown to some of our near neighbors and then laid aside My mistress used to go to class meeting at the Wilk Street meeting house every Monday afternoon and leave me to take care of the house When left thus I used to spend the time in writing in the spaces left in Master Thomas's copy-book copying what he had written I continued to do this until I could write a hand very similar to that of Master Thomas Thus after a long tedious effort for years I finally succeeded in learning how to write VIII IN a very short time after I went to live at Baltimore my old master's youngest son Richard died and in about three years and six months after his death my old master Captain Anthony died leaving only his son Andrew and daughter Lucretia to share his estate He died while on a visit to see his daughter at Hillsborough Cut off thus unexpectedly he left no will as to the disposal of his property It was therefore necessary to have a valuation of the property that it might be equally divided between Mrs Lucretia and Master Andrew I was immediately sent for to be valued with the other property Here again my feelings rose up in detestation of slavery I had now a new conception of my degraded condition Prior to this I had become if not insensible to my lot at least partly so I left Baltimore with a young heart overborne with sadness and a soul full of apprehension I took passage with Captain Rowe in the schooner Wild Cat and after a sail of about twenty-four hours I found myself near the place of my birth I had now been absent from it almost if not quite five years I however remembered the place very well I was only about five years old when I left it to go and live with my old master on Colonel Lloyd's plantation so that I was now between ten and eleven years old We were all ranked together at the valuation Men and women old and young married and single were ranked with horses sheep and swine There were horses and men cattle and women pigs and children all holding the same rank in the scale of being and were all subjected to the same narrow examination Silvery-headed age and sprightly youth maids and matrons had to undergo the same indelicate inspection At this moment I saw more clearly than ever the brutalizing effects of slavery upon both slave and slaveholder After the valuation then came the division I have no language to express the high excitement and deep anxiety which were felt among us poor slaves during this time Our fate for life was now to be decided We had no more voice in that decision than the brutes among whom we were ranked A single word from the white men was enough--against all our wishes prayers and entreaties--to sunder forever the dearest friends dearest kindred and strongest ties known to human beings In addition to the pain of separation there was the horrid dread of falling into the hands of Master Andrew He was known to us all as being a most cruel wretch--a common drunkard who had by his reckless mismanagement and profligate dissipation already wasted a large portion of his father's property We all felt that we might as well be sold at once to the Georgia traders as to pass into his hands for we knew that that would be our inevitable condition--a condition held by us all in the utmost horror and dread I suffered more anxiety than most of my fellow-slaves I had known what it was to be kindly treated they had known nothing of the kind They had seen little or nothing of the world They were in very deed men and women of sorrow and acquainted with grief Their backs had been made familiar with the bloody lash so that they had become callous mine was yet tender for while at Baltimore I got few whippings and few slaves could boast of a kinder master and mistress than myself and the thought of passing out of their hands into those of Master Andrew--a man who but a few days before to give me a sample of his bloody disposition took my little brother by the throat threw him on the ground and with the heel of his boot stamped upon his head till the blood gushed from his nose and ears--was well calculated to make me anxious as to my fate After he had committed this savage outrage upon my brother he turned to me and said that was the way he meant to serve me one of these days--meaning I suppose when I came into his possession Thanks to a kind Providence I fell to the portion of Mrs Lucretia and was sent immediately back to Baltimore to live again in the family of Master Hugh Their joy at my return equalled their sorrow at my departure It was a glad day to me I had escaped a worse than lion's jaws I was absent from Baltimore for the purpose of valuation and division just about one month and it seemed to have been six Very soon after my return to Baltimore my mistress Lucretia died leaving her husband and one child Amanda and in a very short time after her death Master Andrew died Now all the property of my old master slaves included was in the hands of strangers --strangers who had had nothing to do with accumulating it Not a slave was left free All remained slaves from the youngest to the oldest If any one thing in my experience more than another served to deepen my conviction of the infernal character of slavery and to fill me with unutterable loathing of slaveholders it was their base ingratitude to my poor old grandmother She had served my old master faithfully from youth to old age She had been the source of all his wealth she had peopled his plantation with slaves she had become a great grandmother in his service She had rocked him in infancy attended him in childhood served him through life and at his death wiped from his icy brow the cold death-sweat and closed his eyes forever She was nevertheless left a slave--a slave for life--a slave in the hands of strangers and in their hands she saw her children her grandchildren and her great-grand children divided like so many sheep without being gratified with the small privilege of a single word as to their or her own destiny And to cap the climax of their base ingratitude and fiendish barbarity my grandmother who was now very old having outlived my old master and all his children having seen the beginning and end of all of them and her present owners finding she was of but little value her frame already racked with the pains of old age and complete helplessness fast stealing over her once active limbs they took her to the woods built her a little hut put up a little mud-chimney and then made her welcome to the privilege of supporting herself there in perfect loneliness thus virtually turning her out to die If my poor old grandmother now lives she lives to suffer in utter loneliness she lives to remember and mourn over the loss of children the loss of grandchildren and the loss of great-grandchildren They are in the language of the slave's poet Whittier-- Gone gone sold and gone To the rice swamp dank and lone Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings Where the noisome insect stings Where the fever-demon strews Poison with the failing dews Where the sickly sunbeams glare Through the hot and misty air-- Gone gone sold and gone To the rice swamp dank and lone From Virginia hills and waters-- Woe is me my stolen daughters The hearth is desolate The children the unconscious children who once sang and danced in her presence are gone She gropes her way in the darkness of age for a drink of water Instead of the voices of her children she hears by day the moans of the dove and by night the screams of the hideous owl All is gloom The grave is at the door And now when weighed down by the pains and aches of old age when the head inclines to the feet when the beginning and ending of human existence meet and helpless infancy and painful old age combine together--at this time this most needful time the time for the exercise of that tenderness and affection which children only can exercise towards a declining parent-- my poor old grandmother the devoted mother of twelve children is left all alone in yonder little hut before a few dim embers She stands--she sits--she staggers-- she falls--she groans--she dies--and there are none of her children or grandchildren present to wipe from her wrinkled brow the cold sweat of death or to place beneath the sod her fallen remains Will not a righteous God visit for these things In about two years after the death of Mrs Lucretia Master Thomas married his second wife Her name was Rowena Hamilton She was the eldest daughter of Mr William Hamilton Master now lived in St Michael's Not long after his marriage a misunderstanding took place between himself and Master Hugh and as a means of punishing his brother he took me from him to live with himself at St Michael's Here I underwent another most painful separation It however was not so severe as the one I dreaded at the division of property for during this interval a great change had taken place in Master Hugh and his once kind and affectionate wife The influence of brandy upon him and of slavery upon her had effected a disastrous change in the characters of both so that as far as they were concerned I thought I had little to lose by the change But it was not to them that I was attached It was to those little Baltimore boys that I felt the strongest attachment I had received many good lessons from them and was still receiving them and the thought of leaving them was painful indeed I was leaving too without the hope of ever being allowed to return Master Thomas had said he would never let me return again The barrier betwixt himself and brother he considered impassable I then had to regret that I did not at least make the attempt to carry out my resolution to run away for the chances of success are tenfold greater from the city than from the country I sailed from Baltimore for St Michael's in the sloop Amanda Captain Edward Dodson On my passage I paid particular attention to the direction which the steamboats took to go to Philadelphia I found instead of going down on reaching North Point they went up the bay in a north-easterly direction I deemed this knowledge of the utmost importance My determination to run away was again revived I resolved to wait only so long as the offering of a favorable opportunity When that came I was determined to be off IX I HAVE now reached a period of my life when I can give dates I left Baltimore and went to live with Master Thomas Auld at St Michael's in March It was now more than seven years since I lived with him in the family of my old master on Colonel Lloyd's plantation We of course were now almost entire strangers to each other He was to me a new master and I to him a new slave I was ignorant of his temper and disposition he was equally so of mine A very short time however brought us into full acquaintance with each other I was made acquainted with his wife not less than with himself They were well matched being equally mean and cruel I was now for the first time during a space of more than seven years made to feel the painful gnawings of hunger-- a something which I had not experienced before since I left Colonel Lloyd's plantation It went hard enough with me then when I could look back to no period at which I had enjoyed a sufficiency It was tenfold harder after living in Master Hugh's family where I had always had enough to eat and of that which was good I have said Master Thomas was a mean man He was so Not to give a slave enough to eat is regarded as the most aggravated development of meanness even among slaveholders The rule is no matter how coarse the food only let there be enough of it This is the theory and in the part of Maryland from which I came it is the general practice--though there are many exceptions Master Thomas gave us enough of neither coarse nor fine food There were four slaves of us in the kitchen--my sister Eliza my aunt Priscilla Henny and myself and we were allowed less than a half of a bushel of corn-meal per week and very little else either in the shape of meat or vegetables It was not enough for us to subsist upon We were therefore reduced to the wretched necessity of living at the expense of our neighbors This we did by begging and stealing whichever came handy in the time of need the one being considered as legitimate as the other A great many times have we poor creatures been nearly perishing with hunger when food in abundance lay mouldering in the safe and smoke-house and our pious mistress was aware of the fact and yet that mistress and her husband would kneel every morning and pray that God would bless them in basket and store Bad as all slaveholders are we seldom meet one destitute of every element of character commanding respect My master was one of this rare sort I do not know of one single noble act ever performed by him The leading trait in his character was meanness and if there were any other element in his nature it was made subject to this He was mean and like most other mean men he lacked the ability to conceal his meanness Captain Auld was not born a slaveholder He had been a poor man master only of a Bay craft He came into possession of all his slaves by marriage and of all men adopted slaveholders are the worst He was cruel but cowardly He commanded without firmness In the enforcement of his rules he was at times rigid and at times lax At times he spoke to his slaves with the firmness of Napoleon and the fury of a demon at other times he might well be mistaken for an inquirer who had lost his way He did nothing of himself He might have passed for a lion but for his ears In all things noble which he attempted his own meanness shone most conspicuous His airs words and actions were the airs words and actions of born slaveholders and being assumed were awkward enough He was not even a good imitator He possessed all the disposition to deceive but wanted the power Having no resources within himself he was compelled to be the copyist of many and being such he was forever the victim of inconsistency and of consequence he was an object of contempt and was held as such even by his slaves The luxury of having slaves of his own to wait upon him was something new and unprepared for He was a slaveholder without the ability to hold slaves He found himself incapable of managing his slaves either by force fear or fraud We seldom called him master we generally called him Captain Auld and were hardly disposed to title him at all I doubt not that our conduct had much to do with making him appear awkward and of consequence fretful Our want of reverence for him must have perplexed him greatly He wished to have us call him master but lacked the firmness necessary to command us to do so His wife used to insist upon our calling him so but to no purpose In August my master attended a Methodist camp-meeting held in the Bay-side Talbot county and there experienced religion I indulged a faint hope that his conversion would lead him to emancipate his slaves and that if he did not do this it would at any rate make him more kind and humane I was disappointed in both these respects It neither made him to be humane to his slaves nor to emancipate them If it had any effect on his character it made him more cruel and hateful in all his ways for I believe him to have been a much worse man after his conversion than before Prior to his conversion he relied upon his own depravity to shield and sustain him in his savage barbarity but after his conversion he found religious sanction and support for his slaveholding cruelty He made the greatest pretensions to piety His house was the house of prayer He prayed morning noon and night He very soon distinguished himself among his brethren and was soon made a class-leader and exhorter His activity in revivals was great and he proved himself an instrument in the hands of the church in converting many souls His house was the preachers' home They used to take great pleasure in coming there to put up for while he starved us he stuffed them We have had three or four preachers there at a time The names of those who used to come most frequently while I lived there were Mr Storks Mr Ewery Mr Humphry and Mr Hickey I have also seen Mr George Cookman at our house We slaves loved Mr Cookman We believed him to be a good man We thought him instrumental in getting Mr Samuel Harrison a very rich slaveholder to emancipate his slaves and by some means got the impression that he was laboring to effect the emancipation of all the slaves When he was at our house we were sure to be called in to prayers When the others were there we were sometimes called in and sometimes not Mr Cookman took more notice of us than either of the other ministers He could not come among us without betraying his sympathy for us and stupid as we were we had the sagacity to see it While I lived with my master in St Michael's there was a white young man a Mr Wilson who proposed to keep a Sabbath school for the instruction of such slaves as might be disposed to learn to read the New Testament We met but three times when Mr West and Mr Fairbanks both class-leaders with many others came upon us with sticks and other missiles drove us off and forbade us to meet again Thus ended our little Sabbath school in the pious town of St Michael's I have said my master found religious sanction for his cruelty As an example I will state one of many facts going to prove the charge I have seen him tie up a lame young woman and whip her with a heavy cowskin upon her naked shoulders causing the warm red blood to drip and in justification of the bloody deed he would quote this passage of Scripture--He that knoweth his master's will and doeth it not shall be beaten with many stripes Master would keep this lacerated young woman tied up in this horrid situation four or five hours at a time I have known him to tie her up early in the morning and whip her before breakfast leave her go to his store return at dinner and whip her again cutting her in the places already made raw with his cruel lash The secret of master's cruelty toward Henny is found in the fact of her being almost helpless When quite a child she fell into the fire and burned herself horribly Her hands were so burnt that she never got the use of them She could do very little but bear heavy burdens She was to master a bill of expense and as he was a mean man she was a constant offence to him He seemed desirous of getting the poor girl out of existence He gave her away once to his sister but being a poor gift she was not disposed to keep her Finally my benevolent master to use his own words set her adrift to take care of herself Here was a recently-converted man holding on upon the mother and at the same time turning out her helpless child to starve and die Master Thomas was one of the many pious slaveholders who hold slaves for the very charitable purpose of taking care of them My master and myself had quite a number of differences He found me unsuitable to his purpose My city life he said had had a very pernicious effect upon me It had almost ruined me for every good purpose and fitted me for every thing which was bad One of my greatest faults was that of letting his horse run away and go down to his father-in-law's farm which was about five miles from St Michael's I would then have to go after it My reason for this kind of carelessness or carefulness was that I could always get something to eat when I went there Master William Hamilton my master's father-in-law always gave his slaves enough to eat I never left there hungry no matter how great the need of my speedy return Master Thomas at length said he would stand it no longer I had lived with him nine months during which time he had given me a number of severe whippings all to no good purpose He resolved to put me out as he said to be broken and for this purpose he let me for one year to a man named Edward Covey Mr Covey was a poor man a farm-renter He rented the place upon which he lived as also the hands with which he tilled it Mr Covey had acquired a very high reputation for breaking young slaves and this reputation was of immense value to him It enabled him to get his farm tilled with much less expense to himself than he could have had it done without such a reputation Some slaveholders thought it not much loss to allow Mr Covey to have their slaves one year for the sake of the training to which they were subjected without any other compensation He could hire young help with great ease in consequence of this reputation Added to the natural good qualities of Mr Covey he was a professor of religion--a pious soul--a member and a class-leader in the Methodist church All of this added weight to his reputation as a nigger-breaker I was aware of all the facts having been made acquainted with them by a young man who had lived there I nevertheless made the change gladly for I was sure of getting enough to eat which is not the smallest consideration to a hungry man X I LEFT Master Thomas's house and went to live with Mr Covey on the st of January I was now for the first time in my life a field hand In my new employment I found myself even more awkward than a country boy appeared to be in a large city I had been at my new home but one week before Mr Covey gave me a very severe whipping cutting my back causing the blood to run and raising ridges on my flesh as large as my little finger The details of this affair are as follows Mr Covey sent me very early in the morning of one of our coldest days in the month of January to the woods to get a load of wood He gave me a team of unbroken oxen He told me which was the in-hand ox and which the off-hand one He then tied the end of a large rope around the horns of the in-hand ox and gave me the other end of it and told me if the oxen started to run that I must hold on upon the rope I had never driven oxen before and of course I was very awkward I however succeeded in getting to the edge of the woods with little difficulty but I had got a very few rods into the woods when the oxen took fright and started full tilt carrying the cart against trees and over stumps in the most frightful manner I expected every moment that my brains would be dashed out against the trees After running thus for a considerable distance they finally upset the cart dashing it with great force against a tree and threw themselves into it dense thicket How I escaped death I do not know There I was entirely alone in a thick wood in a place new to me My cart was upset and shattered my oxen were entangled among the young trees and there was none to help me After a long spell of effort I succeeded in getting my cart righted my oxen disentangled and again yoked to the cart I now proceeded with my team to the place where I had the day before been chopping wood and loaded my cart pretty heavily thinking in this way to tame my oxen I then proceeded on my way home I had now consumed one half of the day I got out of the woods safely and now felt out of danger I stopped my oxen to open the woods gate and just as I did so before I could get hold of my ox-rope the oxen again started rushed through the gate catching it between the wheel and the body of the cart tearing it to pieces and coming within a few inches of crushing me against the gate-post Thus twice in one short day I escaped death by the merest chance On my return I told Mr Covey what had happened and how it happened He ordered me to return to the woods again immediately I did so and he followed on after me Just as I got into the woods he came up and told me to stop my cart and that he would teach me how to trifle away my time and break gates He then went to a large gum-tree and with his axe cut three large switches and after trimming them up neatly with his pocket-knife he ordered me to take off my clothes I made him no answer but stood with my clothes on He repeated his order I still made him no answer nor did I move to strip myself Upon this he rushed at me with the fierceness of a tiger tore off my clothes and lashed me till he had worn out his switches cutting me so savagely as to leave the marks visible for a long time after This whipping was the first of a number just like it and for similar offences I lived with Mr Covey one year During the first six months of that year scarce a week passed without his whipping me I was seldom free from a sore back My awkwardness was almost always his excuse for whipping me We were worked fully up to the point of endurance Long before day we were up our horses fed and by the first approach of day we were off to the field with our hoes and ploughing teams Mr Covey gave us enough to eat but scarce time to eat it We were often less than five minutes taking our meals We were often in the field from the first approach of day till its last lingering ray had left us and at saving-fodder time midnight often caught us in the field binding blades Covey would be out with us The way he used to stand it was this He would spend the most of his afternoons in bed He would then come out fresh in the evening ready to urge us on with his words example and frequently with the whip Mr Covey was one of the few slaveholders who could and did work with his hands He was a hard-working man He knew by himself just what a man or a boy could do There was no deceiving him His work went on in his absence almost as well as in his presence and he had the faculty of making us feel that he was ever present with us This he did by surprising us He seldom approached the spot where we were at work openly if he could do it secretly He always aimed at taking us by surprise Such was his cunning that we used to call him among ourselves the snake When we were at work in the cornfield he would sometimes crawl on his hands and knees to avoid detection and all at once he would rise nearly in our midst and scream out Ha ha Come come Dash on dash on This being his mode of attack it was never safe to stop a single minute His comings were like a thief in the night He appeared to us as being ever at hand He was under every tree behind every stump in every bush and at every window on the plantation He would sometimes mount his horse as if bound to St Michael's a distance of seven miles and in half an hour afterwards you would see him coiled up in the corner of the wood-fence watching every motion of the slaves He would for this purpose leave his horse tied up in the woods Again he would sometimes walk up to us and give us orders as though he was upon the point of starting on a long journey turn his back upon us and make as though he was going to the house to get ready and before he would get half way thither he would turn short and crawl into a fence-corner or behind some tree and there watch us till the going down of the sun Mr Covey's forte consisted in his power to deceive His life was devoted to planning and perpetrating the grossest deceptions Every thing he possessed in the shape of learning or religion he made conform to his disposition to deceive He seemed to think himself equal to deceiving the Almighty He would make a short prayer in the morning and a long prayer at night and strange as it may seem few men would at times appear more devotional than he The exercises of his family devotions were always commenced with singing and as he was a very poor singer himself the duty of raising the hymn generally came upon me He would read his hymn and nod at me to commence I would at times do so at others I would not My non-compliance would almost always produce much confusion To show himself independent of me he would start and stagger through with his hymn in the most discordant manner In this state of mind he prayed with more than ordinary spirit Poor man Such was his disposition and success at deceiving I do verily believe that he sometimes deceived himself into the solemn belief that he was a sincere worshipper of the most high God and this too at a time when he may be said to have been guilty of compelling his woman slave to commit the sin of adultery The facts in the case are these Mr Covey was a poor man he was just commencing in life he was only able to buy one slave and shocking as is the fact he bought her as he said for a breeder This woman was named Caroline Mr Covey bought her from Mr Thomas Lowe about six miles from St Michael's She was a large able-bodied woman about twenty years old She had already given birth to one child which proved her to be just what he wanted After buying her he hired a married man of Mr Samuel Harrison to live with him one year and him he used to fasten up with her every night The result was that at the end of the year the miserable woman gave birth to twins At this result Mr Covey seemed to be highly pleased both with the man and the wretched woman Such was his joy and that of his wife that nothing they could do for Caroline during her confinement was too good or too hard to be done The children were regarded as being quite an addition to his wealth If at any one time of my life more than another I was made to drink the bitterest dregs of slavery that time was during the first six months of my stay with Mr Covey We were worked in all weathers It was never too hot or too cold it could never rain blow hail or snow too hard for us to work in the field Work work work was scarcely more the order of the day than of the night The longest days were too short for him and the shortest nights too long for him I was somewhat unmanageable when I first went there but a few months of this discipline tamed me Mr Covey succeeded in breaking me I was broken in body soul and spirit My natural elasticity was crushed my intellect languished the disposition to read departed the cheerful spark that lingered about my eye died the dark night of slavery closed in upon me and behold a man transformed into a brute Sunday was my only leisure time I spent this in a sort of beast-like stupor between sleep and wake under some large tree At times I would rise up a flash of energetic freedom would dart through my soul accompanied with a faint beam of hope that flickered for a moment and then vanished I sank down again mourning over my wretched condition I was sometimes prompted to take my life and that of Covey but was prevented by a combination of hope and fear My sufferings on this plantation seem now like a dream rather than a stern reality Our house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake Bay whose broad bosom was ever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable globe Those beautiful vessels robed in purest white so delightful to the eye of freemen were to me so many shrouded ghosts to terrify and torment me with thoughts of my wretched condition I have often in the deep stillness of a summer's Sabbath stood all alone upon the lofty banks of that noble bay and traced with saddened heart and tearful eye the countless number of sails moving off to the mighty ocean The sight of these always affected me powerfully My thoughts would compel utterance and there with no audience but the Almighty I would pour out my soul's complaint in my rude way with an apostrophe to the moving multitude of ships-- You are loosed from your moorings and are free I am fast in my chains and am a slave You move merrily before the gentle gale and I sadly before the bloody whip You are freedom's swift-winged angels that fly round the world I am confined in bands of iron O that I were free O that I were on one of your gallant decks and under your protecting wing Alas betwixt me and you the turbid waters roll Go on go on O that I could also go Could I but swim If I could fly O why was I born a man of whom to make a brute The glad ship is gone she hides in the dim distance I am left in the hottest hell of unending slavery O God save me God deliver me Let me be free Is there any God Why am I a slave I will run away I will not stand it Get caught or get clear I'll try it I had as well die with ague as the fever I have only one life to lose I had as well be killed running as die standing Only think of it one hundred miles straight north and I am free Try it Yes God helping me I will It cannot be that I shall live and die a slave I will take to the water This very bay shall yet bear me into freedom The steamboats steered in a north-east course from North Point I will do the same and when I get to the head of the bay I will turn my canoe adrift and walk straight through Delaware into Pennsylvania When I get there I shall not be required to have a pass I can travel without being disturbed Let but the first opportunity offer and come what will I am off Meanwhile I will try to bear up under the yoke I am not the only slave in the world Why should I fret I can bear as much as any of them Besides I am but a boy and all boys are bound to some one It may be that my misery in slavery will only increase my happiness when I get free There is a better day coming Thus I used to think and thus I used to speak to myself goaded almost to madness at one moment and at the next reconciling myself to my wretched lot I have already intimated that my condition was much worse during the first six months of my stay at Mr Covey's than in the last six The circumstances leading to the change in Mr Covey's course toward me form an epoch in my humble history You have seen how a man was made a slave you shall see how a slave was made a man On one of the hottest days of the month of August Bill Smith William Hughes a slave named Eli and myself were engaged in fanning wheat Hughes was clearing the fanned wheat from before the fan Eli was turning Smith was feeding and I was carrying wheat to the fan The work was simple requiring strength rather than intellect yet to one entirely unused to such work it came very hard About three o'clock of that day I broke down my strength failed me I was seized with a violent aching of the head attended with extreme dizziness I trembled in every limb Finding what was coming I nerved myself up feeling it would never do to stop work I stood as long as I could stagger to the hopper with grain When I could stand no longer I fell and felt as held down by an immense weight The fan of course stopped every one had his own work to do and no one could do the work of the other and have his own go on at the same time Mr Covey was at the house about one hundred yards from the treading-yard where we were fanning On hearing the fan stop he left immediately and came to the spot where we were He hastily inquired what the matter was Bill answered that I was sick and there was no one to bring wheat to the fan I had by this time crawled away under the side of the post and rail-fence by which the yard was enclosed hoping to find relief by getting out of the sun He then asked where I was He was told by one of the hands He came to the spot and after looking at me awhile asked me what was the matter I told him as well as I could for I scarce had strength to speak He then gave me a savage kick in the side and told me to get up I tried to do so but fell back in the attempt He gave me another kick and again told me to rise I again tried and succeeded in gaining my feet but stooping to get the tub with which I was feeding the fan I again staggered and fell While down in this situation Mr Covey took up the hickory slat with which Hughes had been striking off the half-bushel measure and with it gave me a heavy blow upon the head making a large wound and the blood ran freely and with this again told me to get up I made no effort to comply having now made up my mind to let him do his worst In a short time after receiving this blow my head grew better Mr Covey had now left me to my fate At this moment I resolved for the first time to go to my master enter a complaint and ask his protection In order to this I must that afternoon walk seven miles and this under the circumstances was truly a severe undertaking I was exceedingly feeble made so as much by the kicks and blows which I received as by the severe fit of sickness to which I had been subjected I however watched my chance while Covey was looking in an opposite direction and started for St Michael's I succeeded in getting a considerable distance on my way to the woods when Covey discovered me and called after me to come back threatening what he would do if I did not come I disregarded both his calls and his threats and made my way to the woods as fast as my feeble state would allow and thinking I might be overhauled by him if I kept the road I walked through the woods keeping far enough from the road to avoid detection and near enough to prevent losing my way I had not gone far before my little strength again failed me I could go no farther I fell down and lay for a considerable time The blood was yet oozing from the wound on my head For a time I thought I should bleed to death and think now that I should have done so but that the blood so matted my hair as to stop the wound After lying there about three quarters of an hour I nerved myself up again and started on my way through bogs and briers barefooted and bareheaded tearing my feet sometimes at nearly every step and after a journey of about seven miles occupying some five hours to perform it I arrived at master's store I then presented an appearance enough to affect any but a heart of iron From the crown of my head to my feet I was covered with blood My hair was all clotted with dust and blood my shirt was stiff with blood My legs and feet were torn in sundry places with briers and thorns and were also covered with blood I suppose I looked like a man who had escaped a den of wild beasts and barely escaped them In this state I appeared before my master humbly entreating him to interpose his authority for my protection I told him all the circumstances as well as I could and it seemed as I spoke at times to affect him He would then walk the floor and seek to justify Covey by saying he expected I deserved it He asked me what I wanted I told him to let me get a new home that as sure as I lived with Mr Covey again I should live with but to die with him that Covey would surely kill me he was in a fair way for it Master Thomas ridiculed the idea that there was any danger of Mr Covey's killing me and said that he knew Mr Covey that he was a good man and that he could not think of taking me from him that should he do so he would lose the whole year's wages that I belonged to Mr Covey for one year and that I must go back to him come what might and that I must not trouble him with any more stories or that he would himself get hold of me After threatening me thus he gave me a very large dose of salts telling me that I might remain in St Michael's that night it being quite late but that I must be off back to Mr Covey's early in the morning and that if I did not he would get hold of me which meant that he would whip me I remained all night and according to his orders I started off to Covey's in the morning Saturday morning wearied in body and broken in spirit I got no supper that night or breakfast that morning I reached Covey's about nine o'clock and just as I was getting over the fence that divided Mrs Kemp's fields from ours out ran Covey with his cowskin to give me another whipping Before he could reach me I succeeded in getting to the cornfield and as the corn was very high it afforded me the means of hiding He seemed very angry and searched for me a long time My behavior was altogether unaccountable He finally gave up the chase thinking I suppose that I must come home for something to eat he would give himself no further trouble in looking for me I spent that day mostly in the woods having the alternative before me--to go home and be whipped to death or stay in the woods and be starved to death That night I fell in with Sandy Jenkins a slave with whom I was somewhat acquainted Sandy had a free wife who lived about four miles from Mr Covey's and it being Saturday he was on his way to see her I told him my circumstances and he very kindly invited me to go home with him I went home with him and talked this whole matter over and got his advice as to what course it was best for me to pursue I found Sandy an old adviser He told me with great solemnity I must go back to Covey but that before I went I must go with him into another part of the woods where there was a certain root which if I would take some of it with me carrying it always on my right side would render it impossible for Mr Covey or any other white man to whip me He said he had carried it for years and since he had done so he had never received a blow and never expected to while he carried it I at first rejected the idea that the simple carrying of a root in my pocket would have any such effect as he had said and was not disposed to take it but Sandy impressed the necessity with much earnestness telling me it could do no harm if it did no good To please him I at length took the root and according to his direction carried it upon my right side This was Sunday morning I immediately started for home and upon entering the yard gate out came Mr Covey on his way to meeting He spoke to me very kindly bade me drive the pigs from a lot near by and passed on towards the church Now this singular conduct of Mr Covey really made me begin to think that there was something in the root which Sandy had given me and had it been on any other day than Sunday I could have attributed the conduct to no other cause than the influence of that root and as it was I was half inclined to think the root to be something more than I at first had taken it to be All went well till Monday morning On this morning the virtue of the root was fully tested Long before daylight I was called to go and rub curry and feed the horses I obeyed and was glad to obey But whilst thus engaged whilst in the act of throwing down some blades from the loft Mr Covey entered the stable with a long rope and just as I was half out of the loft he caught hold of my legs and was about tying me As soon as I found what he was up to I gave a sudden spring and as I did so he holding to my legs I was brought sprawling on the stable floor Mr Covey seemed now to think he had me and could do what he pleased but at this moment--from whence came the spirit I don't know--I resolved to fight and suiting my action to the resolution I seized Covey hard by the throat and as I did so I rose He held onto me and I to him My resistance was so entirely unexpected that Covey seemed taken all aback He trembled like a leaf This gave me assurance and I held him uneasy causing the blood to run where I touched him with the ends of my fingers Mr Covey soon called out to Hughes for help Hughes came and while Covey held me attempted to tie my right hand While he was in the act of doing so I watched my chance and gave him a heavy kick close under the ribs This kick fairly sickened Hughes so that he left me in the hands of Mr Covey This kick had the effect of not only weakening Hughes but Covey also When he saw Hughes bending over with pain his courage quailed He asked me if I meant to persist in my resistance I told him I did come what might that he had used me like a brute for six months and that I was determined to be used so no longer With that he strove to drag me to a stick that was lying just out of the stable door He meant to knock me down But just as he was leaning over to get the stick I seized him with both hands by his collar and brought him by a sudden snatch to the ground By this time Bill came Covey called upon him for assistance Bill wanted to know what he could do Covey said Take hold of him take hold of him Bill said his master hired him out to work and not to help to whip me so he left Covey and myself to fight our own battle out We were at it for nearly two hours Covey at length let me go puffing and blowing at a great rate saying that if I had not resisted he would not have whipped me half so much The truth was that he had not whipped me at all I considered him as getting entirely the worst end of the bargain for he had drawn no blood from me but I had from him The whole six months afterwards that I spent with Mr Covey he never laid the weight of his finger upon me in anger He would occasionally say he didn't want to get hold of me again No thought I you need not for you will come off worse than you did before This battle with Mr Covey was the turning-point in my career as a slave It rekindled the few expiring embers of freedom and revived within me a sense of my own manhood It recalled the departed self-confidence and inspired me again with a determination to be free The gratification afforded by the triumph was a full compensation for whatever else might follow even death itself He only can understand the deep satisfaction which I experienced who has himself repelled by force the bloody arm of slavery I felt as I never felt before It was a glorious resurrection from the tomb of slavery to the heaven of freedom My long-crushed spirit rose cowardice departed bold defiance took its place and I now resolved that however long I might remain a slave in form the day had passed forever when I could be a slave in fact I did not hesitate to let it be known of me that the white man who expected to succeed in whipping must also succeed in killing me From this time I was never again what might be called fairly whipped though I remained a slave four years afterwards I had several fights but was never whipped It was for a long time a matter of surprise to me why Mr Covey did not immediately have me taken by the constable to the whipping-post and there regularly whipped for the crime of raising my hand against a white man in defence of myself And the only explanation I can now think of does not entirely satisfy me but such as it is I will give it Mr Covey enjoyed the most unbounded reputation for being a first-rate overseer and negro-breaker It was of considerable importance to him That reputation was at stake and had he sent me--a boy about sixteen years old--to the public whipping-post his reputation would have been lost so to save his reputation he suffered me to go unpunished My term of actual service to Mr Edward Covey ended on Christmas day The days between Christmas and New Year's day are allowed as holidays and accordingly we were not required to perform any labor more than to feed and take care of the stock This time we regarded as our own by the grace of our masters and we therefore used or abused it nearly as we pleased Those of us who had families at a distance were generally allowed to spend the whole six days in their society This time however was spent in various ways The staid sober thinking and industrious ones of our number would employ themselves in making corn-brooms mats horse-collars and baskets and another class of us would spend the time in hunting opossums hares and coons But by far the larger part engaged in such sports and merriments as playing ball wrestling running foot-races fiddling dancing and drinking whisky and this latter mode of spending the time was by far the most agreeable to the feelings of our masters A slave who would work during the holidays was considered by our masters as scarcely deserving them He was regarded as one who rejected the favor of his master It was deemed a disgrace not to get drunk at Christmas and he was regarded as lazy indeed who had not provided himself with the necessary means during the year to get whisky enough to last him through Christmas From what I know of the effect of these holidays upon the slave I believe them to be among the most effective means in the hands of the slaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection Were the slaveholders at once to abandon this practice I have not the slightest doubt it would lead to an immediate insurrection among the slaves These holidays serve as conductors or safety-valves to carry off the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity But for these the slave would be forced up to the wildest desperation and woe betide the slaveholder the day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation of those conductors I warn him that in such an event a spirit will go forth in their midst more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake The holidays are part and parcel of the gross fraud wrong and inhumanity of slavery They are professedly a custom established by the benevolence of the slaveholders but I undertake to say it is the result of selfishness and one of the grossest frauds committed upon the down-trodden slave They do not give the slaves this time because they would not like to have their work during its continuance but because they know it would be unsafe to deprive them of it This will be seen by the fact that the slaveholders like to have their slaves spend those days just in such a manner as to make them as glad of their ending as of their beginning Their object seems to be to disgust their slaves with freedom by plunging them into the lowest depths of dissipation For instance the slaveholders not only like to see the slave drink of his own accord but will adopt various plans to make him drunk One plan is to make bets on their slaves as to who can drink the most whisky without getting drunk and in this way they succeed in getting whole multitudes to drink to excess Thus when the slave asks for virtuous freedom the cunning slaveholder knowing his ignorance cheats him with a dose of vicious dissipation artfully labelled with the name of liberty The most of us used to drink it down and the result was just what might be supposed many of us were led to think that there was little to choose between liberty and slavery We felt and very properly too that we had almost as well be slaves to man as to rum So when the holidays ended we staggered up from the filth of our wallowing took a long breath and marched to the field-- feeling upon the whole rather glad to go from what our master had deceived us into a belief was freedom back to the arms of slavery I have said that this mode of treatment is a part of the whole system of fraud and inhumanity of slavery It is so The mode here adopted to disgust the slave with freedom by allowing him to see only the abuse of it is carried out in other things For instance a slave loves molasses he steals some His master in many cases goes off to town and buys a large quantity he returns takes his whip and commands the slave to eat the molasses until the poor fellow is made sick at the very mention of it The same mode is sometimes adopted to make the slaves refrain from asking for more food than their regular allowance A slave runs through his allowance and applies for more His master is enraged at him but not willing to send him off without food gives him more than is necessary and compels him to eat it within a given time Then if he complains that he cannot eat it he is said to be satisfied neither full nor fasting and is whipped for being hard to please I have an abundance of such illustrations of the same principle drawn from my own observation but think the cases I have cited sufficient The practice is a very common one On the first of January I left Mr Covey and went to live with Mr William Freeland who lived about three miles from St Michael's I soon found Mr Freeland a very different man from Mr Covey Though not rich he was what would be called an educated southern gentleman Mr Covey as I have shown was a well-trained negro-breaker and slave-driver The former slaveholder though he was seemed to possess some regard for honor some reverence for justice and some respect for humanity The latter seemed totally insensible to all such sentiments Mr Freeland had many of the faults peculiar to slaveholders such as being very passionate and fretful but I must do him the justice to say that he was exceedingly free from those degrading vices to which Mr Covey was constantly addicted The one was open and frank and we always knew where to find him The other was a most artful deceiver and could be understood only by such as were skilful enough to detect his cunningly-devised frauds Another advantage I gained in my new master was he made no pretensions to or profession of religion and this in my opinion was truly a great advantage I assert most unhesitatingly that the religion of the south is a mere covering for the most horrid crimes--a justifier of the most appalling barbarity--a sanctifier of the most hateful frauds--and a dark shelter under which the darkest foulest grossest and most infernal deeds of slaveholders find the strongest protection Were I to be again reduced to the chains of slavery next to that enslavement I should regard being the slave of a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me For of all slaveholders with whom I have ever met religious slaveholders are the worst I have ever found them the meanest and basest the most cruel and cowardly of all others It was my unhappy lot not only to belong to a religious slaveholder but to live in a community of such religionists Very near Mr Freeland lived the Rev Daniel Weeden and in the same neighborhood lived the Rev Rigby Hopkins These were members and ministers in the Reformed Methodist Church Mr Weeden owned among others a woman slave whose name I have forgotten This woman's back for weeks was kept literally raw made so by the lash of this merciless religious wretch He used to hire hands His maxim was Behave well or behave ill it is the duty of a master occasionally to whip a slave to remind him of his master's authority Such was his theory and such his practice Mr Hopkins was even worse than Mr Weeden His chief boast was his ability to manage slaves The peculiar feature of his government was that of whipping slaves in advance of deserving it He always managed to have one or more of his slaves to whip every Monday morning He did this to alarm their fears and strike terror into those who escaped His plan was to whip for the smallest offences to prevent the commission of large ones Mr Hopkins could always find some excuse for whipping a slave It would astonish one unaccustomed to a slaveholding life to see with what wonderful ease a slaveholder can find things of which to make occasion to whip a slave A mere look word or motion--a mistake accident or want of power--are all matters for which a slave may be whipped at any time Does a slave look dissatisfied It is said he has the devil in him and it must be whipped out Does he speak loudly when spoken to by his master Then he is getting high-minded and should be taken down a button-hole lower Does he forget to pull off his hat at the approach of a white person Then he is wanting in reverence and should be whipped for it Does he ever venture to vindicate his conduct when censured for it Then he is guilty of impudence--one of the greatest crimes of which a slave can be guilty Does he ever venture to suggest a different mode of doing things from that pointed out by his master He is indeed presumptuous and getting above himself and nothing less than a flogging will do for him Does he while ploughing break a plough--or while hoeing break a hoe It is owing to his carelessness and for it a slave must always be whipped Mr Hopkins could always find something of this sort to justify the use of the lash and he seldom failed to embrace such opportunities There was not a man in the whole county with whom the slaves who had the getting their own home would not prefer to live rather than with this Rev Mr Hopkins And yet there was not a man any where round who made higher professions of religion or was more active in revivals --more attentive to the class love-feast prayer and preaching meetings or more devotional in his family--that prayed earlier later louder and longer--than this same reverend slave-driver Rigby Hopkins But to return to Mr Freeland and to my experience while in his employment He like Mr Covey gave us enough to eat but unlike Mr Covey he also gave us sufficient time to take our meals He worked us hard but always between sunrise and sunset He required a good deal of work to be done but gave us good tools with which to work His farm was large but he employed hands enough to work it and with ease compared with many of his neighbors My treatment while in his employment was heavenly compared with what I experienced at the hands of Mr Edward Covey Mr Freeland was himself the owner of but two slaves Their names were Henry Harris and John Harris The rest of his hands he hired These consisted of myself Sandy Jenkins and Handy Caldwell Henry and John were quite intelligent and in a very little while after I went there I succeeded in creating in them a strong desire to learn how to read This desire soon sprang up in the others also They very soon mustered up some old spelling-books and nothing would do but that I must keep a Sabbath school I agreed to do so and accordingly devoted my Sundays to teaching these my loved fellow-slaves how to read Neither of them knew his letters when I went there Some of the slaves of the neighboring farms found This is the same man who gave me the roots to prevent my being whipped by Mr Covey He was a clever soul We used frequently to talk about the fight with Covey and as often as we did so he would claim my success as the result of the roots which he gave me This superstition is very common among the more ignorant slaves A slave seldom dies but that his death is attributed to trickery what was going on and also availed themselves of this little opportunity to learn to read It was understood among all who came that there must be as little display about it as possible It was necessary to keep our religious masters at St Michael's unacquainted with the fact that instead of spending the Sabbath in wrestling boxing and drinking whisky we were trying to learn how to read the will of God for they had much rather see us engaged in those degrading sports than to see us behaving like intellectual moral and accountable beings My blood boils as I think of the bloody manner in which Messrs Wright Fairbanks and Garrison West both class-leaders in connection with many others rushed in upon us with sticks and stones and broke up our virtuous little Sabbath school at St Michael's--all calling themselves Christians humble followers of the Lord Jesus Christ But I am again digressing I held my Sabbath school at the house of a free colored man whose name I deem it imprudent to mention for should it be known it might embarrass him greatly though the crime of holding the school was committed ten years ago I had at one time over forty scholars and those of the right sort ardently desiring to learn They were of all ages though mostly men and women I look back to those Sundays with an amount of pleasure not to be expressed They were great days to my soul The work of instructing my dear fellow-slaves was the sweetest engagement with which I was ever blessed We loved each other and to leave them at the close of the Sabbath was a severe cross indeed When I think that these precious souls are to-day shut up in the prison-house of slavery my feelings overcome me and I am almost ready to ask Does a righteous God govern the universe and for what does he hold the thunders in his right hand if not to smite the oppressor and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the spoiler These dear souls came not to Sabbath school because it was popular to do so nor did I teach them because it was reputable to be thus engaged Every moment they spent in that school they were liable to be taken up and given thirty-nine lashes They came because they wished to learn Their minds had been starved by their cruel masters They had been shut up in mental darkness I taught them because it was the delight of my soul to be doing something that looked like bettering the condition of my race I kept up my school nearly the whole year I lived with Mr Freeland and beside my Sabbath school I devoted three evenings in the week during the winter to teaching the slaves at home And I have the happiness to know that several of those who came to Sabbath school learned how to read and that one at least is now free through my agency The year passed off smoothly It seemed only about half as long as the year which preceded it I went through it without receiving a single blow I will give Mr Freeland the credit of being the best master I ever had till I became my own master For the ease with which I passed the year I was however somewhat indebted to the society of my fellow-slaves They were noble souls they not only possessed loving hearts but brave ones We were linked and inter-linked with each other I loved them with a love stronger than any thing I have experienced since It is sometimes said that we slaves do not love and confide in each other In answer to this assertion I can say I never loved any or confided in any people more than my fellow-slaves and especially those with whom I lived at Mr Freeland's I believe we would have died for each other We never undertook to do any thing of any importance without a mutual consultation We never moved separately We were one and as much so by our tempers and dispositions as by the mutual hardships to which we were necessarily subjected by our condition as slaves At the close of the year Mr Freeland again hired me of my master for the year But by this time I began to want to live upon free land as well as with Freeland and I was no longer content therefore to live with him or any other slaveholder I began with the commencement of the year to prepare myself for a final struggle which should decide my fate one way or the other My tendency was upward I was fast approaching manhood and year after year had passed and I was still a slave These thought roused me--I must do something I therefore resolved that should not pass without witnessing an attempt on my part to secure my liberty But I was not willing to cherish this determination alone My fellow-slaves were dear to me I was anxious to have them participate with me in this my life-giving determination I therefore though with great prudence commenced early to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition and to imbue their minds with thoughts of freedom I bent myself to devising ways and means for our escape and meanwhile strove on all fitting occasions to impress them with the gross fraud and inhumanity of slavery I went first to Henry next to John then to the others I found in them all warm hearts and noble spirits They were ready to hear and ready to act when a feasible plan should be proposed This was what I wanted I talked to them of our want of manhood if we submitted to our enslavement without at least one noble effort to be free We met often and consulted frequently and told our hopes and fears recounted the difficulties real and imagined which we should be called on to meet At times we were almost disposed to give up and try to content ourselves with our wretched lot at others we were firm and unbending in our determination to go Whenever we suggested any plan there was shrinking --the odds were fearful Our path was beset with the greatest obstacles and if we succeeded in gaining the end of it our right to be free was yet questionable--we were yet liable to be returned to bondage We could see no spot this side of the ocean where we could be free We knew nothing about Canada Our knowledge of the north did not extend farther than New York and to go there and be forever harassed with the frightful liability of being returned to slavery--with the certainty of being treated tenfold worse than before--the thought was truly a horrible one and one which it was not easy to overcome The case sometimes stood thus At every gate through which we were to pass we saw a watchman--at every ferry a guard-- on every bridge a sentinel--and in every wood a patrol We were hemmed in upon every side Here were the difficulties real or imagined--the good to be sought and the evil to be shunned On the one hand there stood slavery a stern reality glaring frightfully upon us--its robes already crimsoned with the blood of millions and even now feasting itself greedily upon our own flesh On the other hand away back in the dim distance under the flickering light of the north star behind some craggy hill or snow-covered mountain stood a doubtful freedom--half frozen--beckoning us to come and share its hospitality This in itself was sometimes enough to stagger us but when we permitted ourselves to survey the road we were frequently appalled Upon either side we saw grim death assuming the most horrid shapes Now it was starvation causing us to eat our own flesh--now we were contending with the waves and were drowned--now we were overtaken and torn to pieces by the fangs of the terrible bloodhound We were stung by scorpions chased by wild beasts bitten by snakes and finally after having nearly reached the desired spot--after swimming rivers encountering wild beasts sleeping in the woods suffering hunger and nakedness--we were overtaken by our pursuers and in our resistance we were shot dead upon the spot I say this picture sometimes appalled us and made us rather bear those ills we had Than fly to others that we knew not of In coming to a fixed determination to run away we did more than Patrick Henry when he resolved upon liberty or death With us it was a doubtful liberty at most and almost certain death if we failed For my part I should prefer death to hopeless bondage Sandy one of our number gave up the notion but still encouraged us Our company then consisted of Henry Harris John Harris Henry Bailey Charles Roberts and myself Henry Bailey was my uncle and belonged to my master Charles married my aunt he belonged to my master's father-in-law Mr William Hamilton The plan we finally concluded upon was to get a large canoe belonging to Mr Hamilton and upon the Saturday night previous to Easter holidays paddle directly up the Chesapeake Bay On our arrival at the head of the bay a distance of seventy or eighty miles from where we lived it was our purpose to turn our canoe adrift and follow the guidance of the north star till we got beyond the limits of Maryland Our reason for taking the water route was that we were less liable to be suspected as runaways we hoped to be regarded as fishermen whereas if we should take the land route we should be subjected to interruptions of almost every kind Any one having a white face and being so disposed could stop us and subject us to examination The week before our intended start I wrote several protections one for each of us As well as I can remember they were in the following words to wit-- THIS is to certify that I the undersigned have given the bearer my servant full liberty to go to Baltimore and spend the Easter holidays Written with mine own hand c WILLIAM HAMILTON Near St Michael's in Talbot county Maryland We were not going to Baltimore but in going up the bay we went toward Baltimore and these protections were only intended to protect us while on the bay As the time drew near for our departure our anxiety became more and more intense It was truly a matter of life and death with us The strength of our determination was about to be fully tested At this time I was very active in explaining every difficulty removing every doubt dispelling every fear and inspiring all with the firmness indispensable to success in our undertaking assuring them that half was gained the instant we made the move we had talked long enough we were now ready to move if not now we never should be and if we did not intend to move now we had as well fold our arms sit down and acknowledge ourselves fit only to be slaves This none of us were prepared to acknowledge Every man stood firm and at our last meeting we pledged ourselves afresh in the most solemn manner that at the time appointed we would certainly start in pursuit of freedom This was in the middle of the week at the end of which we were to be off We went as usual to our several fields of labor but with bosoms highly agitated with thoughts of our truly hazardous undertaking We tried to conceal our feelings as much as possible and I think we succeeded very well After a painful waiting the Saturday morning whose night was to witness our departure came I hailed it with joy bring what of sadness it might Friday night was a sleepless one for me I probably felt more anxious than the rest because I was by common consent at the head of the whole affair The responsibility of success or failure lay heavily upon me The glory of the one and the confusion of the other were alike mine The first two hours of that morning were such as I never experienced before and hope never to again Early in the morning we went as usual to the field We were spreading manure and all at once while thus engaged I was overwhelmed with an indescribable feeling in the fulness of which I turned to Sandy who was near by and said We are betrayed Well said he that thought has this moment struck me We said no more I was never more certain of any thing The horn was blown as usual and we went up from the field to the house for breakfast I went for the form more than for want of any thing to eat that morning Just as I got to the house in looking out at the lane gate I saw four white men with two colored men The white men were on horseback and the colored ones were walking behind as if tied I watched them a few moments till they got up to our lane gate Here they halted and tied the colored men to the gate-post I was not yet certain as to what the matter was In a few moments in rode Mr Hamilton with a speed betokening great excitement He came to the door and inquired if Master William was in He was told he was at the barn Mr Hamilton without dismounting rode up to the barn with extraordinary speed In a few moments he and Mr Freeland returned to the house By this time the three constables rode up and in great haste dismounted tied their horses and met Master William and Mr Hamilton returning from the barn and after talking awhile they all walked up to the kitchen door There was no one in the kitchen but myself and John Henry and Sandy were up at the barn Mr Freeland put his head in at the door and called me by name saying there were some gentlemen at the door who wished to see me I stepped to the door and inquired what they wanted They at once seized me and without giving me any satisfaction tied me--lashing my hands closely together I insisted upon knowing what the matter was They at length said that they had learned I had been in a scrape and that I was to be examined before my master and if their information proved false I should not be hurt In a few moments they succeeded in tying John They then turned to Henry who had by this time returned and commanded him to cross his hands I won't said Henry in a firm tone indicating his readiness to meet the consequences of his refusal Won't you said Tom Graham the constable No I won't said Henry in a still stronger tone With this two of the constables pulled out their shining pistols and swore by their Creator that they would make him cross his hands or kill him Each cocked his pistol and with fingers on the trigger walked up to Henry saying at the same time if he did not cross his hands they would blow his damned heart out Shoot me shoot me said Henry you can't kill me but once Shoot shoot--and be damned I won't be tied This he said in a tone of loud defiance and at the same time with a motion as quick as lightning he with one single stroke dashed the pistols from the hand of each constable As he did this all hands fell upon him and after beating him some time they finally overpowered him and got him tied During the scuffle I managed I know not how to get my pass out and without being discovered put it into the fire We were all now tied and just as we were to leave for Easton jail Betsy Freeland mother of William Freeland came to the door with her hands full of biscuits and divided them between Henry and John She then delivered herself of a speech to the following effect--addressing herself to me she said You devil You yellow devil it was you that put it into the heads of Henry and John to run away But for you you long-legged mulatto devil Henry nor John would never have thought of such a thing I made no reply and was immediately hurried off towards St Michael's Just a moment previous to the scuffle with Henry Mr Hamilton suggested the propriety of making a search for the protections which he had understood Frederick had written for himself and the rest But just at the moment he was about carrying his proposal into effect his aid was needed in helping to tie Henry and the excitement attending the scuffle caused them either to forget or to deem it unsafe under the circumstances to search So we were not yet convicted of the intention to run away When we got about half way to St Michael's while the constables having us in charge were looking ahead Henry inquired of me what he should do with his pass I told him to eat it with his biscuit and own nothing and we passed the word around Own nothing and Own nothing said we all Our confidence in each other was unshaken We were resolved to succeed or fail together after the calamity had befallen us as much as before We were now prepared for any thing We were to be dragged that morning fifteen miles behind horses and then to be placed in the Easton jail When we reached St Michael's we underwent a sort of examination We all denied that we ever intended to run away We did this more to bring out the evidence against us than from any hope of getting clear of being sold for as I have said we were ready for that The fact was we cared but little where we went so we went together Our greatest concern was about separation We dreaded that more than any thing this side of death We found the evidence against us to be the testimony of one person our master would not tell who it was but we came to a unanimous decision among ourselves as to who their informant was We were sent off to the jail at Easton When we got there we were delivered up to the sheriff Mr Joseph Graham and by him placed in jail Henry John and myself were placed in one room together-- Charles and Henry Bailey in another Their object in separating us was to hinder concert We had been in jail scarcely twenty minutes when a swarm of slave traders and agents for slave traders flocked into jail to look at us and to ascertain if we were for sale Such a set of beings I never saw before I felt myself surrounded by so many fiends from perdition A band of pirates never looked more like their father the devil They laughed and grinned over us saying Ah my boys we have got you haven't we And after taunting us in various ways they one by one went into an examination of us with intent to ascertain our value They would impudently ask us if we would not like to have them for our masters We would make them no answer and leave them to find out as best they could Then they would curse and swear at us telling us that they could take the devil out of us in a very little while if we were only in their hands While in jail we found ourselves in much more comfortable quarters than we expected when we went there We did not get much to eat nor that which was very good but we had a good clean room from the windows of which we could see what was going on in the street which was very much better than though we had been placed in one of the dark damp cells Upon the whole we got along very well so far as the jail and its keeper were concerned Immediately after the holidays were over contrary to all our expectations Mr Hamilton and Mr Freeland came up to Easton and took Charles the two Henrys and John out of jail and carried them home leaving me alone I regarded this separation as a final one It caused me more pain than any thing else in the whole transaction I was ready for any thing rather than separation I supposed that they had consulted together and had decided that as I was the whole cause of the intention of the others to run away it was hard to make the innocent suffer with the guilty and that they had therefore concluded to take the others home and sell me as a warning to the others that remained It is due to the noble Henry to say he seemed almost as reluctant at leaving the prison as at leaving home to come to the prison But we knew we should in all probability be separated if we were sold and since he was in their hands he concluded to go peaceably home I was now left to my fate I was all alone and within the walls of a stone prison But a few days before and I was full of hope I expected to have been safe in a land of freedom but now I was covered with gloom sunk down to the utmost despair I thought the possibility of freedom was gone I was kept in this way about one week at the end of which Captain Auld my master to my surprise and utter astonishment came up and took me out with the intention of sending me with a gentleman of his acquaintance into Alabama But from some cause or other he did not send me to Alabama but concluded to send me back to Baltimore to live again with his brother Hugh and to learn a trade Thus after an absence of three years and one month I was once more permitted to return to my old home at Baltimore My master sent me away because there existed against me a very great prejudice in the community and he feared I might be killed In a few weeks after I went to Baltimore Master Hugh hired me to Mr William Gardner an extensive ship-builder on Fell's Point I was put there to learn how to calk It however proved a very unfavorable place for the accomplishment of this object Mr Gardner was engaged that spring in building two large man-of-war brigs professedly for the Mexican government The vessels were to be launched in the July of that year and in failure thereof Mr Gardner was to lose a considerable sum so that when I entered all was hurry There was no time to learn any thing Every man had to do that which he knew how to do In entering the ship-yard my orders from Mr Gardner were to do whatever the carpenters commanded me to do This was placing me at the beck and call of about seventy-five men I was to regard all these as masters Their word was to be my law My situation was a most trying one At times I needed a dozen pair of hands I was called a dozen ways in the space of a single minute Three or four voices would strike my ear at the same moment It was--Fred come help me to cant this timber here--Fred come carry this timber yonder--Fred bring that roller here--Fred go get a fresh can of water-- Fred come help saw off the end of this timber-- Fred go quick and get the crowbar--Fred hold on the end of this fall--Fred go to the blacksmith's shop and get a new punch--Hurra Fred run and bring me a cold chisel--I say Fred bear a hand and get up a fire as quick as lightning under that steam-box--Halloo nigger come turn this grindstone--Come come move move and bowse this timber forward--I say darky blast your eyes why don't you heat up some pitch-- Halloo halloo halloo Three voices at the same time Come here--Go there--Hold on where you are Damn you if you move I'll knock your brains out This was my school for eight months and I might have remained there longer but for a most horrid fight I had with four of the white apprentices in which my left eye was nearly knocked out and I was horribly mangled in other respects The facts in the case were these Until a very little while after I went there white and black ship-carpenters worked side by side and no one seemed to see any impropriety in it All hands seemed to be very well satisfied Many of the black carpenters were freemen Things seemed to be going on very well All at once the white carpenters knocked off and said they would not work with free colored workmen Their reason for this as alleged was that if free colored carpenters were encouraged they would soon take the trade into their own hands and poor white men would be thrown out of employment They therefore felt called upon at once to put a stop to it And taking advantage of Mr Gardner's necessities they broke off swearing they would work no longer unless he would discharge his black carpenters Now though this did not extend to me in form it did reach me in fact My fellow-apprentices very soon began to feel it degrading to them to work with me They began to put on airs and talk about the niggers taking the country saying we all ought to be killed and being encouraged by the journeymen they commenced making my condition as hard as they could by hectoring me around and sometimes striking me I of course kept the vow I made after the fight with Mr Covey and struck back again regardless of consequences and while I kept them from combining I succeeded very well for I could whip the whole of them taking them separately They however at length combined and came upon me armed with sticks stones and heavy handspikes One came in front with a half brick There was one at each side of me and one behind me While I was attending to those in front and on either side the one behind ran up with the handspike and struck me a heavy blow upon the head It stunned me I fell and with this they all ran upon me and fell to beating me with their fists I let them lay on for a while gathering strength In an instant I gave a sudden surge and rose to my hands and knees Just as I did that one of their number gave me with his heavy boot a powerful kick in the left eye My eyeball seemed to have burst When they saw my eye closed and badly swollen they left me With this I seized the handspike and for a time pursued them But here the carpenters interfered and I thought I might as well give it up It was impossible to stand my hand against so many All this took place in sight of not less than fifty white ship-carpenters and not one interposed a friendly word but some cried Kill the damned nigger Kill him kill him He struck a white person I found my only chance for life was in flight I succeeded in getting away without an additional blow and barely so for to strike a white man is death by Lynch law--and that was the law in Mr Gardner's ship-yard nor is there much of any other out of Mr Gardner's ship-yard I went directly home and told the story of my wrongs to Master Hugh and I am happy to say of him irreligious as he was his conduct was heavenly compared with that of his brother Thomas under similar circumstances He listened attentively to my narration of the circumstances leading to the savage outrage and gave many proofs of his strong indignation at it The heart of my once overkind mistress was again melted into pity My puffed-out eye and blood-covered face moved her to tears She took a chair by me washed the blood from my face and with a mother's tenderness bound up my head covering the wounded eye with a lean piece of fresh beef It was almost compensation for my suffering to witness once more a manifestation of kindness from this my once affectionate old mistress Master Hugh was very much enraged He gave expression to his feelings by pouring out curses upon the heads of those who did the deed As soon as I got a little the better of my bruises he took me with him to Esquire Watson's on Bond Street to see what could be done about the matter Mr Watson inquired who saw the assault committed Master Hugh told him it was done in Mr Gardner's ship-yard at midday where there were a large company of men at work As to that he said the deed was done and there was no question as to who did it His answer was he could do nothing in the case unless some white man would come forward and testify He could issue no warrant on my word If I had been killed in the presence of a thousand colored people their testimony combined would have been insufficient to have arrested one of the murderers Master Hugh for once was compelled to say this state of things was too bad Of course it was impossible to get any white man to volunteer his testimony in my behalf and against the white young men Even those who may have sympathized with me were not prepared to do this It required a degree of courage unknown to them to do so for just at that time the slightest manifestation of humanity toward a colored person was denounced as abolitionism and that name subjected its bearer to frightful liabilities The watchwords of the bloody-minded in that region and in those days were Damn the abolitionists and Damn the niggers There was nothing done and probably nothing would have been done if I had been killed Such was and such remains the state of things in the Christian city of Baltimore Master Hugh finding he could get no redress refused to let me go back again to Mr Gardner He kept me himself and his wife dressed my wound till I was again restored to health He then took me into the ship-yard of which he was foreman in the employment of Mr Walter Price There I was immediately set to calking and very soon learned the art of using my mallet and irons In the course of one year from the time I left Mr Gardner's I was able to command the highest wages given to the most experienced calkers I was now of some importance to my master I was bringing him from six to seven dollars per week I sometimes brought him nine dollars per week my wages were a dollar and a half a day After learning how to calk I sought my own employment made my own contracts and collected the money which I earned My pathway became much more smooth than before my condition was now much more comfortable When I could get no calking to do I did nothing During these leisure times those old notions about freedom would steal over me again When in Mr Gardner's employment I was kept in such a perpetual whirl of excitement I could think of nothing scarcely but my life and in thinking of my life I almost forgot my liberty I have observed this in my experience of slavery --that whenever my condition was improved instead of its increasing my contentment it only increased my desire to be free and set me to thinking of plans to gain my freedom I have found that to make a contented slave it is necessary to make a thoughtless one It is necessary to darken his moral and mental vision and as far as possible to annihilate the power of reason He must be able to detect no inconsistencies in slavery he must be made to feel that slavery is right and he can be brought to that only when be ceases to be a man I was now getting as I have said one dollar and fifty cents per day I contracted for it I earned it it was paid to me it was rightfully my own yet upon each returning Saturday night I was compelled to deliver every cent of that money to Master Hugh And why Not because he earned it--not because he had any hand in earning it-- not because I owed it to him--nor because he possessed the slightest shadow of a right to it but solely because he had the power to compel me to give it up The right of the grim-visaged pirate upon the high seas is exactly the same XI I NOW come to that part of my life during which I planned and finally succeeded in making my escape from slavery But before narrating any of the peculiar circumstances I deem it proper to make known my intention not to state all the facts connected with the transaction My reasons for pursuing this course may be understood from the following First were I to give a minute statement of all the facts it is not only possible but quite probable that others would thereby be involved in the most embarrassing difficulties Secondly such a statement would most undoubtedly induce greater vigilance on the part of slaveholders than has existed heretofore among them which would of course be the means of guarding a door whereby some dear brother bondman might escape his galling chains I deeply regret the necessity that impels me to suppress any thing of importance connected with my experience in slavery It would afford me great pleasure indeed as well as materially add to the interest of my narrative were I at liberty to gratify a curiosity which I know exists in the minds of many by an accurate statement of all the facts pertaining to my most fortunate escape But I must deprive myself of this pleasure and the curious of the gratification which such a statement would afford I would allow myself to suffer under the greatest imputations which evil-minded men might suggest rather than exculpate myself and thereby run the hazard of closing the slightest avenue by which a brother slave might clear himself of the chains and fetters of slavery I have never approved of the very public manner in which some of our western friends have conducted what they call the underground railroad but which I think by their open declarations has been made most emphatically the upperground railroad I honor those good men and women for their noble daring and applaud them for willingly subjecting themselves to bloody persecution by openly avowing their participation in the escape of slaves I however can see very little good resulting from such a course either to themselves or the slaves escaping while upon the other hand I see and feel assured that those open declarations are a positive evil to the slaves remaining who are seeking to escape They do nothing towards enlightening the slave whilst they do much towards enlightening the master They stimulate him to greater watchfulness and enhance his power to capture his slave We owe something to the slaves south of the line as well as to those north of it and in aiding the latter on their way to freedom we should be careful to do nothing which would be likely to hinder the former from escaping from slavery I would keep the merciless slaveholder profoundly ignorant of the means of flight adopted by the slave I would leave him to imagine himself surrounded by myriads of invisible tormentors ever ready to snatch from his infernal grasp his trembling prey Let him be left to feel his way in the dark let darkness commensurate with his crime hover over him and let him feel that at every step he takes in pursuit of the flying bondman he is running the frightful risk of having his hot brains dashed out by an invisible agency Let us render the tyrant no aid let us not hold the light by which he can trace the footprints of our flying brother But enough of this I will now proceed to the statement of those facts connected with my escape for which I am alone responsible and for which no one can be made to suffer but myself In the early part of the year I became quite restless I could see no reason why I should at the end of each week pour the reward of my toil into the purse of my master When I carried to him my weekly wages he would after counting the money look me in the face with a robber-like fierceness and ask Is this all He was satisfied with nothing less than the last cent He would however when I made him six dollars sometimes give me six cents to encourage me It had the opposite effect I regarded it as a sort of admission of my right to the whole The fact that he gave me any part of my wages was proof to my mind that he believed me entitled to the whole of them I always felt worse for having received any thing for I feared that the giving me a few cents would ease his conscience and make him feel himself to be a pretty honorable sort of robber My discontent grew upon me I was ever on the look-out for means of escape and finding no direct means I determined to try to hire my time with a view of getting money with which to make my escape In the spring of when Master Thomas came to Baltimore to purchase his spring goods I got an opportunity and applied to him to allow me to hire my time He unhesitatingly refused my request and told me this was another stratagem by which to escape He told me I could go nowhere but that he could get me and that in the event of my running away he should spare no pains in his efforts to catch me He exhorted me to content myself and be obedient He told me if I would be happy I must lay out no plans for the future He said if I behaved myself properly he would take care of me Indeed he advised me to complete thoughtlessness of the future and taught me to depend solely upon him for happiness He seemed to see fully the pressing necessity of setting aside my intellectual nature in order to contentment in slavery But in spite of him and even in spite of myself I continued to think and to think about the injustice of my enslavement and the means of escape About two months after this I applied to Master Hugh for the privilege of hiring my time He was not acquainted with the fact that I had applied to Master Thomas and had been refused He too at first seemed disposed to refuse but after some reflection he granted me the privilege and proposed the following terms I was to be allowed all my time make all contracts with those for whom I worked and find my own employment and in return for this liberty I was to pay him three dollars at the end of each week find myself in calking tools and in board and clothing My board was two dollars and a half per week This with the wear and tear of clothing and calking tools made my regular expenses about six dollars per week This amount I was compelled to make up or relinquish the privilege of hiring my time Rain or shine work or no work at the end of each week the money must be forthcoming or I must give up my privilege This arrangement it will be perceived was decidedly in my master's favor It relieved him of all need of looking after me His money was sure He received all the benefits of slaveholding without its evils while I endured all the evils of a slave and suffered all the care and anxiety of a freeman I found it a hard bargain But hard as it was I thought it better than the old mode of getting along It was a step towards freedom to be allowed to bear the responsibilities of a freeman and I was determined to hold on upon it I bent myself to the work of making money I was ready to work at night as well as day and by the most untiring perseverance and industry I made enough to meet my expenses and lay up a little money every week I went on thus from May till August Master Hugh then refused to allow me to hire my time longer The ground for his refusal was a failure on my part one Saturday night to pay him for my week's time This failure was occasioned by my attending a camp meeting about ten miles from Baltimore During the week I had entered into an engagement with a number of young friends to start from Baltimore to the camp ground early Saturday evening and being detained by my employer I was unable to get down to Master Hugh's without disappointing the company I knew that Master Hugh was in no special need of the money that night I therefore decided to go to camp meeting and upon my return pay him the three dollars I staid at the camp meeting one day longer than I intended when I left But as soon as I returned I called upon him to pay him what he considered his due I found him very angry he could scarce restrain his wrath He said he had a great mind to give me a severe whipping He wished to know how I dared go out of the city without asking his permission I told him I hired my time and while I paid him the price which he asked for it I did not know that I was bound to ask him when and where I should go This reply troubled him and after reflecting a few moments he turned to me and said I should hire my time no longer that the next thing he should know of I would be running away Upon the same plea he told me to bring my tools and clothing home forthwith I did so but instead of seeking work as I had been accustomed to do previously to hiring my time I spent the whole week without the performance of a single stroke of work I did this in retaliation Saturday night he called upon me as usual for my week's wages I told him I had no wages I had done no work that week Here we were upon the point of coming to blows He raved and swore his determination to get hold of me I did not allow myself a single word but was resolved if he laid the weight of his hand upon me it should be blow for blow He did not strike me but told me that he would find me in constant employment in future I thought the matter over during the next day Sunday and finally resolved upon the third day of September as the day upon which I would make a second attempt to secure my freedom I now had three weeks during which to prepare for my journey Early on Monday morning before Master Hugh had time to make any engagement for me I went out and got employment of Mr Butler at his ship-yard near the drawbridge upon what is called the City Block thus making it unnecessary for him to seek employment for me At the end of the week I brought him between eight and nine dollars He seemed very well pleased and asked me why I did not do the same the week before He little knew what my plans were My object in working steadily was to remove any suspicion he might entertain of my intent to run away and in this I succeeded admirably I suppose he thought I was never better satisfied with my condition than at the very time during which I was planning my escape The second week passed and again I carried him my full wages and so well pleased was he that he gave me twenty-five cents quite a large sum for a slaveholder to give a slave and bade me to make a good use of it I told him I would Things went on without very smoothly indeed but within there was trouble It is impossible for me to describe my feelings as the time of my contemplated start drew near I had a number of warm-hearted friends in Baltimore--friends that I loved almost as I did my life --and the thought of being separated from them forever was painful beyond expression It is my opinion that thousands would escape from slavery who now remain but for the strong cords of affection that bind them to their friends The thought of leaving my friends was decidedly the most painful thought with which I had to contend The love of them was my tender point and shook my decision more than all things else Besides the pain of separation the dread and apprehension of a failure exceeded what I had experienced at my first attempt The appalling defeat I then sustained returned to torment me I felt assured that if I failed in this attempt my case would be a hopeless one--it would seat my fate as a slave forever I could not hope to get off with any thing less than the severest punishment and being placed beyond the means of escape It required no very vivid imagination to depict the most frightful scenes through which I should have to pass in case I failed The wretchedness of slavery and the blessedness of freedom were perpetually before me It was life and death with me But I remained firm and according to my resolution on the third day of September I left my chains and succeeded in reaching New York without the slightest interruption of any kind How I did so-- what means I adopted--what direction I travelled and by what mode of conveyance--I must leave unexplained for the reasons before mentioned I have been frequently asked how I felt when I found myself in a free State I have never been able to answer the question with any satisfaction to myself It was a moment of the highest excitement I ever experienced I suppose I felt as one may imagine the unarmed mariner to feel when he is rescued by a friendly man-of-war from the pursuit of a pirate In writing to a dear friend immediately after my arrival at New York I said I felt like one who had escaped a den of hungry lions This state of mind however very soon subsided and I was again seized with a feeling of great insecurity and loneliness I was yet liable to be taken back and subjected to all the tortures of slavery This in itself was enough to damp the ardor of my enthusiasm But the loneliness overcame me There I was in the midst of thousands and yet a perfect stranger without home and without friends in the midst of thousands of my own brethren--children of a common Father and yet I dared not to unfold to any one of them my sad condition I was afraid to speak to any one for fear of speaking to the wrong one and thereby falling into the hands of money-loving kidnappers whose business it was to lie in wait for the panting fugitive as the ferocious beasts of the forest lie in wait for their prey The motto which I adopted when I started from slavery was this--Trust no man I saw in every white man an enemy and in almost every colored man cause for distrust It was a most painful situation and to understand it one must needs experience it or imagine himself in similar circumstances Let him be a fugitive slave in a strange land--a land given up to be the hunting-ground for slaveholders--whose inhabitants are legalized kidnappers--where he is every moment subjected to the terrible liability of being seized upon by his fellowmen as the hideous crocodile seizes upon his prey-- say let him place himself in my situation--without home or friends--without money or credit--wanting shelter and no one to give it--wanting bread and no money to buy it--and at the same time let him feel that he is pursued by merciless men-hunters and in total darkness as to what to do where to go or where to stay-- perfectly helpless both as to the means of defence and means of escape--in the midst of plenty yet suffering the terrible gnawings of hunger-- in the midst of houses yet having no home--among fellow-men yet feeling as if in the midst of wild beasts whose greediness to swallow up the trembling and half-famished fugitive is only equalled by that with which the monsters of the deep swallow up the helpless fish upon which they subsist--I say let him be placed in this most trying situation--the situation in which I was placed-- then and not till then will he fully appreciate the hardships of and know how to sympathize with the toil-worn and whip-scarred fugitive slave Thank Heaven I remained but a short time in this distressed situation I was relieved from it by the humane hand of Mr DAVID RUGGLES whose vigilance kindness and perseverance I shall never forget I am glad of an opportunity to express as far as words can the love and gratitude I bear him Mr Ruggles is now afflicted with blindness and is himself in need of the same kind offices which he was once so forward in the performance of toward others I had been in New York but a few days when Mr Ruggles sought me out and very kindly took me to his boarding-house at the corner of Church and Lespenard Streets Mr Ruggles was then very deeply engaged in the memorable Darg case as well as attending to a number of other fugitive slaves devising ways and means for their successful escape and though watched and hemmed in on almost every side he seemed to be more than a match for his enemies Very soon after I went to Mr Ruggles he wished to know of me where I wanted to go as he deemed it unsafe for me to remain in New York I told him I was a calker and should like to go where I could get work I thought of going to Canada but he decided against it and in favor of my going to New Bedford thinking I should be able to get work there at my trade At this time Anna my intended wife came on for I wrote to her immediately after my arrival at New York notwithstanding my homeless houseless and helpless condition informing her of my successful flight and wishing her to come on forthwith In a few days after her arrival Mr Ruggles called in the Rev J W C Pennington who in the presence of Mr Ruggles Mrs Michaels and two or three others performed the marriage ceremony and gave us a certificate of which the following is an exact copy-- THIS may certify that I joined together in holy matrimony Frederick Johnson and Anna Murray as man and wife in the presence of Mr David Ruggles and Mrs Michaels JAMES W C PENNINGTON New York Sept Upon receiving this certificate and a five-dollar bill from Mr Ruggles I shouldered one part of our baggage and Anna took up the other and we set out forthwith to take passage on board of the steamboat John W Richmond for Newport on our way to New She was free I had changed my name from Frederick Bailey to that of Johnson Bedford Mr Ruggles gave me a letter to a Mr Shaw in Newport and told me in case my money did not serve me to New Bedford to stop in Newport and obtain further assistance but upon our arrival at Newport we were so anxious to get to a place of safety that notwithstanding we lacked the necessary money to pay our fare we decided to take seats in the stage and promise to pay when we got to New Bedford We were encouraged to do this by two excellent gentlemen residents of New Bedford whose names I afterward ascertained to be Joseph Ricketson and William C Taber They seemed at once to understand our circumstances and gave us such assurance of their friendliness as put us fully at ease in their presence It was good indeed to meet with such friends at such a time Upon reaching New Bedford we were directed to the house of Mr Nathan Johnson by whom we were kindly received and hospitably provided for Both Mr and Mrs Johnson took a deep and lively interest in our welfare They proved themselves quite worthy of the name of abolitionists When the stage-driver found us unable to pay our fare he held on upon our baggage as security for the debt I had but to mention the fact to Mr Johnson and he forthwith advanced the money We now began to feel a degree of safety and to prepare ourselves for the duties and responsibilities of a life of freedom On the morning after our arrival at New Bedford while at the breakfast-table the question arose as to what name I should be called by The name given me by my mother was Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey I however had dispensed with the two middle names long before I left Maryland so that I was generally known by the name of Frederick Bailey I started from Baltimore bearing the name of Stanley When I got to New York I again changed my name to Frederick Johnson and thought that would be the last change But when I got to New Bedford I found it necessary again to change my name The reason of this necessity was that there were so many Johnsons in New Bedford it was already quite difficult to distinguish between them I gave Mr Johnson the privilege of choosing me a name but told him be must not take from me the name of Frederick I must hold on to that to preserve a sense of my identity Mr Johnson had just been reading the Lady of the Lake and at once suggested that my name be Douglass From that time until now I have been called Frederick Douglass and as I am more widely known by that name than by either of the others I shall continue to use it as my own I was quite disappointed at the general appearance of things in New Bedford The impression which I had received respecting the character and condition of the people of the north I found to be singularly erroneous I had very strangely supposed while in slavery that few of the comforts and scarcely any of the luxuries of life were enjoyed at the north compared with what were enjoyed by the slaveholders of the south I probably came to this conclusion from the fact that northern people owned no slaves I supposed that they were about upon a level with the non-slaveholding population of the south I knew they were exceedingly poor and I had been accustomed to regard their poverty as the necessary consequence of their being non-slaveholders I had somehow imbibed the opinion that in the absence of slaves there could be no wealth and very little refinement And upon coming to the north I expected to meet with a rough hard-handed and uncultivated population living in the most Spartan-like simplicity knowing nothing of the ease luxury pomp and grandeur of southern slaveholders Such being my conjectures any one acquainted with the appearance of New Bedford may very readily infer how palpably I must have seen my mistake In the afternoon of the day when I reached New Bedford I visited the wharves to take a view of the shipping Here I found myself surrounded with the strongest proofs of wealth Lying at the wharves and riding in the stream I saw many ships of the finest model in the best order and of the largest size Upon the right and left I was walled in by granite warehouses of the widest dimensions stowed to their utmost capacity with the necessaries and comforts of life Added to this almost every body seemed to be at work but noiselessly so compared with what I had been accustomed to in Baltimore There were no loud songs heard from those engaged in loading and unloading ships I heard no deep oaths or horrid curses on the laborer I saw no whipping of men but all seemed to go smoothly on Every man appeared to understand his work and went at it with a sober yet cheerful earnestness which betokened the deep interest which he felt in what he was doing as well as a sense of his own dignity as a man To me this looked exceedingly strange From the wharves I strolled around and over the town gazing with wonder and admiration at the splendid churches beautiful dwellings and finely-cultivated gardens evincing an amount of wealth comfort taste and refinement such as I had never seen in any part of slaveholding Maryland Every thing looked clean new and beautiful I saw few or no dilapidated houses with poverty-stricken inmates no half-naked children and barefooted women such as I had been accustomed to see in Hillsborough Easton St Michael's and Baltimore The people looked more able stronger healthier and happier than those of Maryland I was for once made glad by a view of extreme wealth without being saddened by seeing extreme poverty But the most astonishing as well as the most interesting thing to me was the condition of the colored people a great many of whom like myself had escaped thither as a refuge from the hunters of men I found many who had not been seven years out of their chains living in finer houses and evidently enjoying more of the comforts of life than the average of slaveholders in Maryland I will venture to assert that my friend Mr Nathan Johnson of whom I can say with a grateful heart I was hungry and he gave me meat I was thirsty and he gave me drink I was a stranger and he took me in lived in a neater house dined at a better table took paid for and read more newspapers better understood the moral religious and political character of the nation--than nine tenths of the slaveholders in Talbot county Maryland Yet Mr Johnson was a working man His hands were hardened by toil and not his alone but those also of Mrs Johnson I found the colored people much more spirited than I had supposed they would be I found among them a determination to protect each other from the blood-thirsty kidnapper at all hazards Soon after my arrival I was told of a circumstance which illustrated their spirit A colored man and a fugitive slave were on unfriendly terms The former was heard to threaten the latter with informing his master of his whereabouts Straightway a meeting was called among the colored people under the stereotyped notice Business of importance The betrayer was invited to attend The people came at the appointed hour and organized the meeting by appointing a very religious old gentleman as president who I believe made a prayer after which he addressed the meeting as follows Friends we have got him here and I would recommend that you young men just take him outside the door and kill him With this a number of them bolted at him but they were intercepted by some more timid than themselves and the betrayer escaped their vengeance and has not been seen in New Bedford since I believe there have been no more such threats and should there be hereafter I doubt not that death would be the consequence I found employment the third day after my arrival in stowing a sloop with a load of oil It was new dirty and hard work for me but I went at it with a glad heart and a willing hand I was now my own master It was a happy moment the rapture of which can be understood only by those who have been slaves It was the first work the reward of which was to be entirely my own There was no Master Hugh standing ready the moment I earned the money to rob me of it I worked that day with a pleasure I had never before experienced I was at work for myself and newly-married wife It was to me the starting-point of a new existence When I got through with that job I went in pursuit of a job of calking but such was the strength of prejudice against color among the white calkers that they refused to work with me and of course I could get no employment Finding my trade of no immediate benefit I threw off my calking habiliments and prepared myself to do any kind of work I could get to do Mr Johnson kindly let me have his wood-horse and saw and I very soon found myself a plenty of work There was no work too hard--none too dirty I was ready to saw wood shovel coal carry the hod sweep the chimney or roll oil casks--all of which I did for nearly three years in New Bedford before I became known to the anti-slavery world In about four months after I went to New Bedford there came a young man to me and inquired if I did not wish to take the Liberator I told him I did but just having made my escape from slavery I remarked that I was unable to pay for it then I however finally became a subscriber to it The paper came and I read it from week to week with such I am told that colored persons can now get employment at calking in New Bedford--a result of anti-slavery effort feelings as it would be quite idle for me to attempt to describe The paper became my meat and my drink My soul was set all on fire Its sympathy for my brethren in bonds--its scathing denunciations of slaveholders--its faithful exposures of slavery--and its powerful attacks upon the upholders of the institution--sent a thrill of joy through my soul such as I had never felt before I had not long been a reader of the Liberator before I got a pretty correct idea of the principles measures and spirit of the anti-slavery reform I took right hold of the cause I could do but little but what I could I did with a joyful heart and never felt happier than when in an anti-slavery meeting I seldom had much to say at the meetings because what I wanted to say was said so much better by others But while attending an anti-slavery convention at Nantucket on the th of August I felt strongly moved to speak and was at the same time much urged to do so by Mr William C Coffin a gentleman who had heard me speak in the colored people's meeting at New Bedford It was a severe cross and I took it up reluctantly The truth was I felt myself a slave and the idea of speaking to white people weighed me down I spoke but a few moments when I felt a degree of freedom and said what I desired with considerable ease From that time until now I have been engaged in pleading the cause of my brethren--with what success and with what devotion I leave those acquainted with my labors to decide APPENDIX I FIND since reading over the foregoing Narrative that I have in several instances spoken in such a tone and manner respecting religion as may possibly lead those unacquainted with my religious views to suppose me an opponent of all religion To remove the liability of such misapprehension I deem it proper to append the following brief explanation What I have said respecting and against religion I mean strictly to apply to the slaveholding religion of this land and with no possible reference to Christianity proper for between the Christianity of this land and the Christianity of Christ I recognize the widest possible difference--so wide that to receive the one as good pure and holy is of necessity to reject the other as bad corrupt and wicked To be the friend of the one is of necessity to be the enemy of the other I love the pure peaceable and impartial Christianity of Christ I therefore hate the corrupt slaveholding women-whipping cradle-plundering partial and hypocritical Christianity of this land Indeed I can see no reason but the most deceitful one for calling the religion of this land Christianity I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers the boldest of all frauds and the grossest of all libels Never was there a clearer case of stealing the livery of the court of heaven to serve the devil in I am filled with unutterable loathing when I contemplate the religious pomp and show together with the horrible inconsistencies which every where surround me We have men-stealers for ministers women-whippers for missionaries and cradle-plunderers for church members The man who wields the blood-clotted cowskin during the week fills the pulpit on Sunday and claims to be a minister of the meek and lowly Jesus The man who robs me of my earnings at the end of each week meets me as a class-leader on Sunday morning to show me the way of life and the path of salvation He who sells my sister for purposes of prostitution stands forth as the pious advocate of purity He who proclaims it a religious duty to read the Bible denies me the right of learning to read the name of the God who made me He who is the religious advocate of marriage robs whole millions of its sacred influence and leaves them to the ravages of wholesale pollution The warm defender of the sacredness of the family relation is the same that scatters whole families-- sundering husbands and wives parents and children sisters and brothers leaving the hut vacant and the hearth desolate We see the thief preaching against theft and the adulterer against adultery We have men sold to build churches women sold to support the gospel and babes sold to purchase Bibles for the poor heathen all for the glory of God and the good of souls The slave auctioneer's bell and the church-going bell chime in with each other and the bitter cries of the heart-broken slave are drowned in the religious shouts of his pious master Revivals of religion and revivals in the slave-trade go hand in hand together The slave prison and the church stand near each other The clanking of fetters and the rattling of chains in the prison and the pious psalm and solemn prayer in the church may be heard at the same time The dealers in the bodies and souls of men erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit and they mutually help each other The dealer gives his blood-stained gold to support the pulpit and the pulpit in return covers his infernal business with the garb of Christianity Here we have religion and robbery the allies of each other--devils dressed in angels' robes and hell presenting the semblance of paradise Just God and these are they Who minister at thine altar God of right Men who their hands with prayer and blessing lay On Israel's ark of light What preach and kidnap men Give thanks and rob thy own afflicted poor Talk of thy glorious liberty and then Bolt hard the captive's door What servants of thy own Merciful Son who came to seek and save The homeless and the outcast fettering down The tasked and plundered slave Pilate and Herod friends Chief priests and rulers as of old combine Just God and holy is that church which lends Strength to the spoiler thine The Christianity of America is a Christianity of whose votaries it may be as truly said as it was of the ancient scribes and Pharisees They bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers All their works they do for to be seen of men-- They love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues and to be called of men Rabbi Rabbi--But woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in Ye devour widows' houses and for a pretence make long prayers therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves--Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone Ye blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess--Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity Dark and terrible as is this picture I hold it to be strictly true of the overwhelming mass of professed Christians in America They strain at a gnat and swallow a camel Could any thing be more true of our churches They would be shocked at the proposition of fellowshipping a sheep-stealer and at the same time they hug to their communion a man-stealer and brand me with being an infidel if I find fault with them for it They attend with Pharisaical strictness to the outward forms of religion and at the same time neglect the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith They are always ready to sacrifice but seldom to show mercy They are they who are represented as professing to love God whom they have not seen whilst they hate their brother whom they have seen They love the heathen on the other side of the globe They can pray for him pay money to have the Bible put into his hand and missionaries to instruct him while they despise and totally neglect the heathen at their own doors Such is very briefly my view of the religion of this land and to avoid any misunderstanding growing out of the use of general terms I mean by the religion of this land that which is revealed in the words deeds and actions of those bodies north and south calling themselves Christian churches and yet in union with slaveholders It is against religion as presented by these bodies that I have felt it my duty to testify I conclude these remarks by copying the following portrait of the religion of the south which is by communion and fellowship the religion of the north which I soberly affirm is true to the life and without caricature or the slightest exaggeration It is said to have been drawn several years before the present anti-slavery agitation began by a northern Methodist preacher who while residing at the south had an opportunity to see slaveholding morals manners and piety with his own eyes Shall I not visit for these things saith the Lord Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this A PARODY Come saints and sinners hear me tell How pious priests whip Jack and Nell And women buy and children sell And preach all sinners down to hell And sing of heavenly union They'll bleat and baa dona like goats Gorge down black sheep and strain at motes Array their backs in fine black coats Then seize their negroes by their throats And choke for heavenly union They'll church you if you sip a dram And damn you if you steal a lamb Yet rob old Tony Doll and Sam Of human rights and bread and ham Kidnapper's heavenly union They'll loudly talk of Christ's reward And bind his image with a cord And scold and swing the lash abhorred And sell their brother in the Lord To handcuffed heavenly union They'll read and sing a sacred song And make a prayer both loud and long And teach the right and do the wrong Hailing the brother sister throng With words of heavenly union We wonder how such saints can sing Or praise the Lord upon the wing Who roar and scold and whip and sting And to their slaves and mammon cling In guilty conscience union They'll raise tobacco corn and rye And drive and thieve and cheat and lie And lay up treasures in the sky By making switch and cowskin fly In hope of heavenly union They'll crack old Tony on the skull And preach and roar like Bashan bull Or braying ass of mischief full Then seize old Jacob by the wool And pull for heavenly union A roaring ranting sleek man-thief Who lived on mutton veal and beef Yet never would afford relief To needy sable sons of grief Was big with heavenly union 'Love not the world' the preacher said And winked his eye and shook his head He seized on Tom and Dick and Ned Cut short their meat and clothes and bread Yet still loved heavenly union Another preacher whining spoke Of One whose heart for sinners broke He tied old Nanny to an oak And drew the blood at every stroke And prayed for heavenly union Two others oped their iron jaws And waved their children-stealing paws There sat their children in gewgaws By stinting negroes' backs and maws They kept up heavenly union All good from Jack another takes And entertains their flirts and rakes Who dress as sleek as glossy snakes And cram their mouths with sweetened cakes And this goes down for union Sincerely and earnestly hoping that this little book may do something toward throwing light on the American slave system and hastening the glad day of deliverance to the millions of my brethren in bonds--faithfully relying upon the power of truth love and justice for success in my humble efforts--and solemnly pledging my self anew to the sacred cause--I subscribe myself FREDERICK DOUGLASS LYNN Mass April THE END
Harriet,INCIDENTS IN THE LIFE OF A SLAVE GIRL WRITTEN BY HERSELF Northerners know nothing at all about Slavery They think it is perpetual bondage only They have no conception of the depth of degradation involved in that word SLAVERY if they had they would never cease their efforts until so horrible a system was overthrown A WOMAN OF NORTH CAROLINA Rise up ye women that are at ease Hear my voice ye careless daughters Give ear unto my speech ISAIAH xxxii EDITED BY L MARIA CHILD BOSTON PUBLISHED FOR THE AUTHOR Entered according to Act of Congress in the year by L MARIA CHILD In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR READER be assured this narrative is no fiction I am aware that some of my adventures may seem incredible but they are nevertheless strictly true I have not exaggerated the wrongs inflicted by Slavery on the contrary my descriptions fall far short of the facts I have concealed the names of places and given persons fictitious names I had no motive for secrecy on my own account but I deemed it kind and considerate towards others to pursue this course I wish I were more competent to the task I have undertaken But I trust my readers will excuse deficiencies in consideration of circumstances I was born and reared in Slavery and I remained in a Slave State twenty-seven years Since I have been at the North it has been necessary for me to work diligently for my own support and the education of my children This has not left me much leisure to make up for the loss of early opportunities to improve myself and it has compelled me to write these s at irregular intervals whenever I could snatch an hour from household duties When I first arrived in Philadelphia Bishop Paine advised me to publish a sketch of my life but I told him I was altogether incompetent to such an undertaking Though I have improved my mind somewhat since that time I still remain of the same opinion but I trust my motives will excuse what might otherwise seem presumptuous I have not written my experiences in order to attract attention to myself on the contrary it would have been more pleasant to me to have been silent about my own history Neither do I care to excite sympathy for my own sufferings But I do earnestly desire to arouse the women of the North to a realizing sense of the condition of two millions of women at the South still in bondage suffering what I suffered and most of them far worse I want to add my testimony to that of abler pens to convince the people of the Free States what Slavery really is Only by experience can any one realize how deep and dark and foul is that pit of abominations May the blessing of God rest on this imperfect effort in behalf of my persecuted people LINDA BRENT INTRODUCTION BY THE EDITOR THE author of the following autobiography is personally known to me and her conversation and manners inspire me with confidence During the last seventeen years she has lived the greater part of the time with a distinguished family in New York and has so deported herself as to be highly esteemed by them This fact is sufficient without further credentials of her character I believe those who know her will not be disposed to doubt her veracity though some incidents in her story are more romantic than fiction At her request I have revised her manuscript but such changes as I have made have been mainly for purposes of condensation and orderly arrangement I have not added any thing to the incidents or changed the import of her very pertinent remarks With trifling exceptions both the ideas and the language are her own I pruned excrescences a little but otherwise I had no reason for changing her lively and dramatic way of telling her own story The names of both persons and places are known to me but for good reasons I suppress them It will naturally excite surprise that a woman reared in Slavery should be able to write so well But circumstances will explain this In the first place nature endowed her with quick perceptions Secondly the mistress with whom she lived till she was twelve years old was a kind considerate friend who taught her to read and spell Thirdly she was placed in favorable circumstances after she came to the North having frequent intercourse with intelligent persons who felt a friendly interest in her welfare and were disposed to give her opportunities for self-improvement I am well aware that many will accuse me of indecorum for presenting these s to the public for the experiences of this intelligent and much-injured woman belong to a class which some call delicate subjects and others indelicate This peculiar phase of Slavery has generally been kept veiled but the public ought to be made acquainted with its monstrous features and I willingly take the responsibility of presenting them with the veil withdrawn I do this for the sake of my sisters in bondage who are suffering wrongs so foul that our ears are too delicate to listen to them I do it with the hope of arousing conscientious and reflecting women at the North to a sense of their duty in the exertion of moral influence on the question of Slavery on all possible occasions I do it with the hope that every man who reads this narrative will swear solemnly before God that so far as he has power to prevent it no fugitive from Slavery shall ever be sent back to suffer in that loathsome den of corruption and cruelty L MARIA CHILD CONTENTS CHILDHOOD THE NEW MASTER AND MISTRESS THE SLAVES' NEW YEAR'S DAY THE SLAVE WHO DARED TO FEEL LIKE A

THE CONFESSION THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW FREE AT LAST APPENDIX INCIDENTS IN THE LIFE OF A SLAVE GIRL SEVEN YEARS CONCEALED I CHILDHOOD I WAS born a slave but I never knew it till six years of happy childhood had passed away My father was a carpenter and considered so intelligent and skilful in his trade that when buildings out of the common line were to be erected he was sent for from long distances to be head workman On condition of paying his mistress two hundred dollars a year and supporting himself he was allowed to work at his trade and manage his own affairs His strongest wish was to purchase his children but though he several times offered his hard earnings for that purpose he never succeeded In complexion my parents were a light shade of brownish yellow and were termed mulattoes They lived together in a comfortable home and though we were all slaves I was so fondly shielded that I never dreamed I was a piece of merchandise trusted to them for safe keeping and liable to be demanded of them at any moment I had one brother William who was two years younger than myselfa bright affectionate child I had also a great treasure in my maternal grandmother who was a remarkable woman in many respects She was the daughter of a planter in South Carolina who at his death left her mother and his three children free with money to go to St Augustine where they had relatives It was during the Revolutionary War and they were captured on their passage carried back and sold to different purchasers Such was the story my grandmother used to tell me but I do not remember all the particulars She was a little girl when she was captured and sold to the keeper of a large hotel I have often heard her tell how hard she fared during childhood But as she grew older she evinced so much intelligence and was so faithful that her master and mistress could not help seeing it was for their interest to take care of such a valuable piece of property She became an indispensable personage in the household officiating in all capacities from cook and wet nurse to seamstress She was much praised for her cooking and her nice crackers became so famous in the neighborhood that many people were desirous of obtaining them In consequence of numerous requests of this kind she asked permission of her mistress to bake crackers at night after all the household work was done and she obtained leave to do it provided she would clothe herself and her children from the profits Upon these terms after working hard all day for her mistress she began her midnight bakings assisted by her two oldest children The business proved profitable and each year she laid by a little which was saved for a fund to purchase her children Her master died and the property was divided among his heirs The widow had her dower in the hotel which she continued to keep open My grandmother remained in her service as a slave but her children were divided among her master's children As she had five Benjamin the youngest one was sold in order that each heir might have an equal portion of dollars and cents There was so little difference in our ages that he seemed more like my brother than my uncle He was a bright handsome lad nearly white for he inherited the complexion my grandmother had derived from Anglo-Saxon ancestors Though only ten years old seven hundred and twenty dollars were paid for him His sale was a terrible blow to my grandmother but she was naturally hopeful and she went to work with renewed energy trusting in time to be able to purchase some of her children She had laid up three hundred dollars which her mistress one day begged as a loan promising to pay her soon The reader probably knows that no promise or writing given to a slave is legally binding for according to Southern laws a slave being property can hold no property When my grandmother lent her hard earnings to her mistress she trusted solely to her honor The honor of a slaveholder to a slave To this good grandmother I was indebted for many comforts My brother Willie and I often received portions of the crackers cakes and preserves she made to sell and after we ceased to be children we were indebted to her for many more important services Such were the unusually fortunate circumstances of my early childhood When I was six years old my mother died and then for the first time I learned by the talk around me that I was a slave My mother's mistress was the daughter of my grandmother's mistress She was the foster sister of my mother they were both nourished at my grandmother's breast In fact my mother had been weaned at three months old that the babe of the mistress might obtain sufficient food They played together as children and when they became women my mother was a most faithful servant to her whiter foster sister On her death-bed her mistress promised that her children should never suffer for any thing and during her lifetime she kept her word They all spoke kindly of my dead mother who had been a slave merely in name but in nature was noble and womanly I grieved for her and my young mind was troubled with the thought who would now take care of me and my little brother I was told that my home was now to be with her mistress and I found it a happy one No toilsome or disagreeable duties were imposed upon me My mistress was so kind to me that I was always glad to do her bidding and proud to labor for her as much as my young years would permit I would sit by her side for hours sewing diligently with a heart as free from care as that of any free-born white child When she thought I was tired she would send me out to run and jump and away I bounded to gather berries or flowers to decorate her room Those were happy daystoo happy to last The slave child had no thought for the morrow but there came that blight which too surely waits on every human being born to be a chattel When I was nearly twelve years old my kind mistress sickened and died As I saw the cheek grow paler and the eye more glassy how earnestly I prayed in my heart that she might live I loved her for she had been almost like a mother to me My prayers were not answered She died and they buried her in the little churchyard where day after day my tears fell upon her grave I was sent to spend a week with my grandmother I was now old enough to begin to think of the future and again and again I asked myself what they would do with me I felt sure I should never find another mistress so kind as the one who was gone She had promised my dying mother that her children should never suffer for any thing and when I remembered that and recalled her many proofs of attachment to me I could not help having some hopes that she had left me free My friends were almost certain it would be so They thought she would be sure to do it on account of my mother's love and faithful service But alas we all know that the memory of a faithful slave does not avail much to save her children from the auction block After a brief period of suspense the will of my mistress was read and we learned that she had bequeathed me to her sister's daughter a child of five years old So vanished our hopes My mistress had taught me the precepts of God's Word Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you do ye even so unto them But I was her slave and I suppose she did not recognize me as her neighbor I would give much to blot out from my memory that one great wrong As a child I loved my mistress and looking back on the happy days I spent with her I try to think with less bitterness of this act of injustice While I was with her she taught me to read and spell and for this privilege which so rarely falls to the lot of a slave I bless her memory She possessed but few slaves and at her death those were all distributed among her relatives Five of them were my grandmother's children and had shared the same milk that nourished her mother's children Notwithstanding my grandmother's long and faithful service to her owners not one of her children escaped the auction block These God-breathing machines are no more in the sight of their masters than the cotton they plant or the horses they tend II THE NEW MASTER AND MISTRESS DR FLINT a physician in the neighborhood had married the sister of my mistress and I was now the property of their little daughter It was not without murmuring that I prepared for my new home and what added to my unhappiness was the fact that my brother William was purchased by the same family My father by his nature as well as by the habit of transacting business as a skilful mechanic had more of the feelings of a freeman than is common among slaves My brother was a spirited boy and being brought up under such influences he early detested the name of master and mistress One day when his father and his mistress both happened to call him at the same time he hesitated between the two being perplexed to know which had the strongest claim upon his obedience He finally concluded to go to his mistress When my father reproved him for it he said You both called me and I didn't know which I ought to go to first You are my child replied our father and when I call you you should come immediately if you have to pass through fire and water Poor Willie He was now to learn his first lesson of obedience to a master Grandmother tried to cheer us with hopeful words and they found an echo in the credulous hearts of youth When we entered our new home we encountered cold looks cold words and cold treatment We were glad when the night came On my narrow bed I moaned and wept I felt so desolate and alone I had been there nearly a year when a dear little friend of mine was buried I heard her mother sob as the clods fell on the coffin of her only child and I turned away from the grave feeling thankful that I still had something left to love I met my grandmother who said Come with me Linda and from her tone I knew that something sad had happened She led me apart from the people and then said My child your father is dead Dead How could I believe it He had died so suddenly I had not even heard that he was sick I went home with my grandmother My heart rebelled against God who had taken from me mother father mistress and friend The good grandmother tried to comfort me Who knows the ways of God said she Perhaps they have been kindly taken from the evil days to come Years afterwards I often thought of this She promised to be a mother to her grandchildren so far as she might be permitted to do so and strengthened by her love I returned to my master's I thought I should be allowed to go to my father's house the next morning but I was ordered to go for flowers that my mistress's house might be decorated for an evening party I spent the day gathering flowers and weaving them into festoons while the dead body of my father was lying within a mile of me What cared my owners for that he was merely a piece of property Moreover they thought he had spoiled his children by teaching them to feel that they were human beings This was blasphemous doctrine for a slave to teach presumptuous in him and dangerous to the masters The next day I followed his remains to a humble grave beside that of my dear mother There were those who knew my father's worth and respected his memory My home now seemed more dreary than ever The laugh of the little slave-children sounded harsh and cruel It was selfish to feel so about the joy of others My brother moved about with a very grave face I tried to comfort him by saying Take courage Willie brighter days will come by and by You don't know any thing about it Linda he replied We shall have to stay here all our days we shall never be free I argued that we were growing older and stronger and that perhaps we might before long be allowed to hire our own time and then we could earn money to buy our freedom William declared this was much easier to say than to do moreover he did not intend to buy his freedom We held daily controversies upon this subject Little attention was paid to the slaves' meals in Dr Flint's house If they could catch a bit of food while it was going well and good I gave myself no trouble on that score for on my various errands I passed my grandmother's house where there was always something to spare for me I was frequently threatened with punishment if I stopped there and my grandmother to avoid detaining me often stood at the gate with something for my breakfast or dinner I was indebted to her for all my comforts spiritual or temporal It was her labor that supplied my scanty wardrobe I have a vivid recollection of the linsey-woolsey dress given me every winter by Mrs Flint How I hated it It was one of the badges of slavery While my grandmother was thus helping to support me from her hard earnings the three hundred dollars she had lent her mistress were never repaid When her mistress died her son-in-law Dr Flint was appointed executor When grandmother applied to him for payment he said the estate was insolvent and the law prohibited payment It did not however prohibit him from retaining the silver candelabra which had been purchased with that money I presume they will be handed down in the family from generation to generation My grandmother's mistress had always promised her that at her death she should be free and it was said that in her will she made good the promise But when the estate was settled Dr Flint told the faithful old servant that under existing circumstances it was necessary she should be sold On the appointed day the customary advertisement was posted up proclaiming that there would be a public sale of negroes horses c Dr Flint called to tell my grandmother that he was unwilling to wound her feelings by putting her up at auction and that he would prefer to dispose of her at private sale My grandmother saw through his hypocrisy she understood very well that he was ashamed of the job She was a very spirited woman and if he was base enough to sell her when her mistress intended she should be free she was determined the public should know it She had for a long time supplied many families with crackers and preserves consequently Aunt Marthy as she was called was generally known and every body who knew her respected her intelligence and good character Her long and faithful service in the family was also well known and the intention of her mistress to leave her free When the day of sale came she took her place among the chattels and at the first call she sprang upon the auction-block Many voices called out Shame Shame Who is going to sell you aunt Marthy Don't stand there That is no place for you Without saying a word she quietly awaited her fate No one bid for her At last a feeble voice said Fifty dollars It came from a maiden lady seventy years old the sister of my grandmother's deceased mistress She had lived forty years under the same roof with my grandmother she knew how faithfully she had served her owners and how cruelly she had been defrauded of her rights and she resolved to protect her The auctioneer waited for a higher bid but her wishes were respected no one bid above her She could neither read nor write and when the bill of sale was made out she signed it with a cross But what consequence was that when she had a big heart overflowing with human kindness She gave the old servant her freedom At that time my grandmother was just fifty years old Laborious years had passed since then and now my brother and I were slaves to the man who had defrauded her of her money and tried to defraud her of her freedom One of my mother's sisters called Aunt Nancy was also a slave in his family She was a kind good aunt to me and supplied the place of both housekeeper and waiting maid to her mistress She was in fact at the beginning and end of every thing Mrs Flint like many southern women was totally deficient in energy She had not strength to superintend her household affairs but her nerves were so strong that she could sit in her easy chair and see a woman whipped till the blood trickled from every stroke of the lash She was a member of the church but partaking of the Lord's supper did not seem to put her in a Christian frame of mind If dinner was not served at the exact time on that particular Sunday she would station herself in the kitchen and wait till it was dished and then spit in all the kettles and pans that had been used for cooking She did this to prevent the cook and her children from eking out their meagre fare with the remains of the gravy and other scrapings The slaves could get nothing to eat except what she chose to give them Provisions were weighed out by the pound and ounce three times a day I can assure you she gave them no chance to eat wheat bread from her flour barrel She knew how many biscuits a quart of flour would make and exactly what size they ought to be Dr Flint was an epicure The cook never sent a dinner to his table without fear and trembling for if there happened to be a dish not to his liking he would either order her to be whipped or compel her to eat every mouthful of it in his presence The poor hungry creature might not have objected to eating it but she did object to having her master cram it down her throat till she choked They had a pet dog that was a nuisance in the house The cook was ordered to make some Indian mush for him He refused to eat and when his head was held over it the froth flowed from his mouth into the basin He died a few minutes after When Dr Flint came in he said the mush had not been well cooked and that was the reason the animal would not eat it He sent for the cook and compelled her to eat it He thought that the woman's stomach was stronger than the dog's but her sufferings afterwards proved that he was mistaken This poor woman endured many cruelties from her master and mistress sometimes she was locked up away from her nursing baby for a whole day and night When I had been in the family a few weeks one of the plantation slaves was brought to town by order of his master It was near night when he arrived and Dr Flint ordered him to be taken to the work house and tied up to the joist so that his feet would just escape the ground In that situation he was to wait till the doctor had taken his tea I shall never forget that night Never before in my life had I heard hundreds of blows fall in succession on a human being His piteous groans and his O pray don't massa rang in my ear for months afterwards There were many conjectures as to the cause of this terrible punishment Some said master accused him of stealing corn others said the slave had quarrelled with his wife in presence of the overseer and had accused his master of being the father of her child They were both black and the child was very fair I went into the work house next morning and saw the cowhide still wet with blood and the boards all covered with gore The poor man lived and continued to quarrel with his wife A few months afterwards Dr Flint handed them both over to a slave-trader The guilty man put their value into his pocket and had the satisfaction of knowing that they were out of sight and hearing When the mother was delivered into the trader's hands she said You promised to treat me well To which he replied You have let your tongue run too far damn you She had forgotten that it was a crime for a slave to tell who was the father of her child From others than the master persecution also comes in such cases I once saw a young slave girl dying soon after the birth of a child nearly white In her agony she cried out O Lord come and take me Her mistress stood by and mocked at her like an incarnate fiend You suffer do you she exclaimed I am glad of it You deserve it all and more too The girl's mother said The baby is dead thank God and I hope my poor child will soon be in heaven too Heaven retorted the mistress There is no such place for the like of her and her bastard The poor mother turned away sobbing Her dying daughter called her feebly and as she bent over her I heard her say Don't grieve so mother God knows all about it and HE will have mercy upon me Her sufferings afterwards became so intense that her mistress felt unable to stay but when she left the room the scornful smile was still on her lips Seven children called her mother The poor black woman had but the one child whose eyes she saw closing in death while she thanked God for taking her away from the greater bitterness of life III THE SLAVES' NEW YEAR'S DAY DR FLINT owned a fine residence in town several farms and about fifty slaves besides hiring a number by the year Hiring-day at the south takes place on the st of January On the d the slaves are expected to go to their new masters On a farm they work until the corn and cotton are laid They then have two holidays Some masters give them a good dinner under the trees This over they work until Christmas eve If no heavy charges are meantime brought against them they are given four or five holidays whichever the master or overseer may think proper Then comes New Year's eve and they gather together their little alls or more properly speaking their little nothings and wait anxiously for the dawning of day At the appointed hour the grounds are thronged with men women and children waiting like criminals to hear their doom pronounced The slave is sure to know who is the most humane or cruel master within forty miles of him It is easy to find out on that day who clothes and feeds his slaves well for he is surrounded by a crowd begging Please massa hire me this year I will work very hard massa If a slave is unwilling to go with his new master he is whipped or locked up in jail until he consents to go and promises not to run away during the year Should he chance to change his mind thinking it justifiable to violate an extorted promise woe unto him if he is caught The whip is used till the blood flows at his feet and his stiffened limbs are put in chains to be dragged in the field for days and days If he lives until the next year perhaps the same man will hire him again without even giving him an opportunity of going to the hiring-ground After those for hire are disposed of those for sale are called up O you happy free women contrast your New Year's day with that of the poor bond-woman With you it is a pleasant season and the light of the day is blessed Friendly wishes meet you every where and gifts are showered upon you Even hearts that have been estranged from you soften at this season and lips that have been silent echo back I wish you a happy New Year Children bring their little offerings and raise their rosy lips for a caress They are your own and no hand but that of death can take them from you But to the slave mother New Year's day comes laden with peculiar sorrows She sits on her cold cabin floor watching the children who may all be torn from her the next morning and often does she wish that she and they might die before the day dawns She may be an ignorant creature degraded by the system that has brutalized her from childhood but she has a mother's instincts and is capable of feeling a mother's agonies On one of these sale days I saw a mother lead seven children to the auction-block She knew that some of them would be taken from her but they took all The children were sold to a slave-trader and their mother was bought by a man in her own town Before night her children were all far away She begged the trader to tell her where he intended to take them this he refused to do How could he when he knew he would sell them one by one wherever he could command the highest price I met that mother in the street and her wild haggard face lives to-day in my mind She wrung her hands in anguish and exclaimed Gone All gone Why don't God kill me I had no words wherewith to comfort her Instances of this kind are of daily yea of hourly occurrence Slaveholders have a method peculiar to their institution of getting rid of old slaves whose lives have been worn out in their service I knew an old woman who for seventy years faithfully served her master She had become almost helpless from hard labor and disease Her owners moved to Alabama and the old black woman was left to be sold to any body who would give twenty dollars for her IV THE SLAVE WHO DARED TO FEEL LIKE A MAN TWO years had passed since I entered Dr Flint's family and those years had brought much of the knowledge that comes from experience though they had afforded little opportunity for any other kinds of knowledge My grandmother had as much as possible been a mother to her orphan grandchildren By perseverance and unwearied industry she was now mistress of a snug little home surrounded with the necessaries of life She would have been happy could her children have shared them with her There remained but three children and two grandchildren all slaves Most earnestly did she strive to make us feel that it was the will of God that He had seen fit to place us under such circumstances and though it seemed hard we ought to pray for contentment It was a beautiful faith coming from a mother who could not call her children her own But I and Benjamin her youngest boy condemned it We reasoned that it was much more the will of God that we should be situated as she was We longed for a home like hers There we always found sweet balsam for our troubles She was so loving so sympathizing She always met us with a smile and listened with patience to all our sorrows She spoke so hopefully that unconsciously the clouds gave place to sunshine There was a grand big oven there too that baked bread and nice things for the town and we knew there was always a choice bit in store for us But alas even the charms of the old oven failed to reconcile us to our hard lot Benjamin was now a tall handsome lad strongly and gracefully made and with a spirit too bold and daring for a slave My brother William now twelve years old had the same aversion to the word master that he had when he was an urchin of seven years I was his confidant He came to me with all his troubles I remember one instance in particular It was on a lovely spring morning and when I marked the sunlight dancing here and there its beauty seemed to mock my sadness For my master whose restless craving vicious nature roved about day and night seeking whom to devour had just left me with stinging scorching words words that scathed ear and brain like fire O how I despised him I thought how glad I should be if some day when he walked the earth it would open and swallow him up and disencumber the world of a plague When he told me that I was made for his use made to obey his command in every thing that I was nothing but a slave whose will must and should surrender to his never before had my puny arm felt half so strong So deeply was I absorbed in painful reflections afterwards that I neither saw nor heard the entrance of any one till the voice of William sounded close beside me Linda said he what makes you look so sad I love you O Linda isn't this a bad world Every body seems so cross and unhappy I wish I had died when poor father did I told him that every body was not cross or unhappy that those who had pleasant homes and kind friends and who were not afraid to love them were happy But we who were slave-children without father or mother could not expect to be happy We must be good perhaps that would bring us contentment Yes he said I try to be good but what's the use They are all the time troubling me Then he proceeded to relate his afternoon's difficulty with young master Nicholas It seemed that the brother of master Nicholas had pleased himself with making up stories about William Master Nicholas said he should be flogged and he would do it Whereupon he went to work but William fought bravely and the young master finding he was getting the better of him undertook to tie his hands behind him He failed in that likewise By dint of kicking and fisting William came out of the skirmish none the worse for a few scratches He continued to discourse on his young master's meanness how he whipped the little boys but was a perfect coward when a tussle ensued between him and white boys of his own size On such occasions he always took to his legs William had other charges to make against him One was his rubbing up pennies with quicksilver and passing them off for quarters of a dollar on an old man who kept a fruit stall William was often sent to buy fruit and he earnestly inquired of me what he ought to do under such circumstances I told him it was certainly wrong to deceive the old man and that it was his duty to tell him of the impositions practised by his young master I assured him the old man would not be slow to comprehend the whole and there the matter would end William thought it might with the old man but not with him He said he did not mind the smart of the whip but he did not like the idea of being whipped While I advised him to be good and forgiving I was not unconscious of the beam in my own eye It was the very knowledge of my own shortcomings that urged me to retain if possible some sparks of my brother's God-given nature I had not lived fourteen years in slavery for nothing I had felt seen and heard enough to read the characters and question the motives of those around me The war of my life had begun and though one of God's most powerless creatures I resolved never to be conquered Alas for me If there was one pure sunny spot for me I believed it to be in Benjamin's heart and in another's whom I loved with all the ardor of a girl's first love My owner knew of it and sought in every way to render me miserable He did not resort to corporal punishment but to all the petty tyrannical ways that human ingenuity could devise I remember the first time I was punished It was in the month of February My grandmother had taken my old shoes and replaced them with a new pair I needed them for several inches of snow had fallen and it still continued to fall When I walked through Mrs Flint's room their creaking grated harshly on her refined nerves She called me to her and asked what I had about me that made such a horrid noise I told her it was my new shoes Take them off said she and if you put them on again I'll throw them into the fire I took them off and my stockings also She then sent me a long distance on an errand As I went through the snow my bare feet tingled That night I was very hoarse and I went to bed thinking the next day would find me sick perhaps dead What was my grief on waking to find myself quite well I had imagined if I died or was laid up for some time that my mistress would feel a twinge of remorse that she had so hated the little imp as she styled me It was my ignorance of that mistress that gave rise to such extravagant imaginings Dr Flint occasionally had high prices offered for me but he always said She don't belong to me She is my daughter's property and I have no right to sell her Good honest man My young mistress was still a child and I could look for no protection from her I loved her and she returned my affection I once heard her father allude to her attachment to me and his wife promptly replied that it proceeded from fear This put unpleasant doubts into my mind Did the child feign what she did not feel or was her mother jealous of the mite of love she bestowed on me I concluded it must be the latter I said to myself Surely little children are true One afternoon I sat at my sewing feeling unusual depression of spirits My mistress had been accusing me of an offence of which I assured her I was perfectly innocent but I saw by the contemptuous curl of her lip that she believed I was telling a lie I wondered for what wise purpose God was leading me through such thorny paths and whether still darker days were in store for me As I sat musing thus the door opened softly and William came in Well brother said I what is the matter this time O Linda Ben and his master have had a dreadful time said he My first thought was that Benjamin was killed Don't be frightened Linda said William I will tell you all about it It appeared that Benjamin's master had sent for him and he did not immediately obey the summons When he did his master was angry and began to whip him He resisted Master and slave fought and finally the master was thrown Benjamin had cause to tremble for he had thrown to the ground his masterone of the richest men in town I anxiously awaited the result That night I stole to my grandmother's house and Benjamin also stole thither from his master's My grandmother had gone to spend a day or two with an old friend living in the country I have come said Benjamin to tell you good by I am going away I inquired where To the north he replied I looked at him to see whether he was in earnest I saw it all in his firm set mouth I implored him not to go but he paid no heed to my words He said he was no longer a boy and every day made his yoke more galling He had raised his hand against his master and was to be publicly whipped for the offence I reminded him of the poverty and hardships he must encounter among strangers I told him he might be caught and brought back and that was terrible to think of He grew vexed and asked if poverty and hardships with freedom were not preferable to our treatment in slavery Linda he continued we are dogs here foot-balls cattle every thing that's mean No I will not stay Let them bring me back We don't die but once He was right but it was hard to give him up Go said I and break your mother's heart I repented of my words ere they were out Linda said he speaking as I had not heard him speak that evening how could you say that Poor mother be kind to her Linda and you too cousin Fanny Cousin Fanny was a friend who had lived some years with us Farewells were exchanged and the bright kind boy endeared to us by so many acts of love vanished from our sight It is not necessary to state how he made his escape Suffice it to say he was on his way to New York when a violent storm overtook the vessel The captain said he must put into the nearest port This alarmed Benjamin who was aware that he would be advertised in every port near his own town His embarrassment was noticed by the captain To port they went There the advertisement met the captain's eye Benjamin so exactly answered its description that the captain laid hold on him and bound him in chains The storm passed and they proceeded to New York Before reaching that port Benjamin managed to get off his chains and throw them overboard He escaped from the vessel but was pursued captured and carried back to his master When my grandmother returned home and found her youngest child had fled great was her sorrow but with characteristic piety she said God's will be done Each morning she inquired if any news had been heard from her boy Yes news was heard The master was rejoicing over a letter announcing the capture of his human chattel That day seems but as yesterday so well do I remember it I saw him led through the streets in chains to jail His face was ghastly pale yet full of determination He had begged one of the sailors to go to his mother's house and ask her not to meet him He said the sight of her distress would take from him all self-control She yearned to see him and she went but she screened herself in the crowd that it might be as her child had said We were not allowed to visit him but we had known the jailer for years and he was a kind-hearted man At midnight he opened the jail door for my grandmother and myself to enter in disguise When we entered the cell not a sound broke the stillness Benjamin Benjamin whispered my grandmother No answer Benjamin she again faltered There was a jingle of chains The moon had just risen and cast an uncertain light through the bars of the window We knelt down and took Benjamin's cold hands in ours We did not speak Sobs were heard and Benjamin's lips were unsealed for his mother was weeping on his neck How vividly does memory bring back that sad night Mother and son talked together He had asked her pardon for the suffering he had caused her She said she had nothing to forgive she could not blame his desire for freedom He told her that when he was captured he broke away and was about casting himself into the river when thoughts of her came over him and he desisted She asked if he did not also think of God I fancied I saw his face grow fierce in the moonlight He answered No I did not think of him When a man is hunted like a wild beast he forgets there is a God a heaven He forgets every thing in his struggle to get beyond the reach of the bloodhounds Don't talk so Benjamin said she Put your trust in God Be humble my child and your master will forgive you Forgive me for what mother For not letting him treat me like a dog No I will never humble myself to him I have worked for him for nothing all my life and I am repaid with stripes and imprisonment Here I will stay till I die or till he sells me The poor mother shuddered at his words I think he felt it for when he next spoke his voice was calmer Don't fret about me mother I ain't worth it said he I wish I had some of your goodness You bear every thing patiently just as though you thought it was all right I wish I could She told him she had not always been so once she was like him but when sore troubles came upon her and she had no arm to lean upon she learned to call on God and he lightened her burdens She besought him to do likewise We overstaid our time and were obliged to hurry from the jail Benjamin had been imprisoned three weeks when my grandmother went to intercede for him with his master He was immovable He said Benjamin should serve as an example to the rest of his slaves he should be kept in jail till he was subdued or be sold if he got but one dollar for him However he afterwards relented in some degree The chains were taken off and we were allowed to visit him As his food was of the coarsest kind we carried him as often as possible a warm supper accompanied with some little luxury for the jailer Three months elapsed and there was no prospect of release or of a purchaser One day he was heard to sing and laugh This piece of indecorum was told to his master and the overseer was ordered to re-chain him He was now confined in an apartment with other prisoners who were covered with filthy rags Benjamin was chained near them and was soon covered with vermin He worked at his chains till he succeeded in getting out of them He passed them through the bars of the window with a request that they should be taken to his master and he should be informed that he was covered with vermin This audacity was punished with heavier chains and prohibition of our visits My grandmother continued to send him fresh changes of clothes The old ones were burned up The last night we saw him in jail his mother still begged him to send for his master and beg his pardon Neither persuasion nor argument could turn him from his purpose He calmly answered I am waiting his time Those chains were mournful to hear Another three months passed and Benjamin left his prison walls We that loved him waited to bid him a long and last farewell A slave trader had bought him You remember I told you what price he brought when ten years of age Now he was more than twenty years old and sold for three hundred dollars The master had been blind to his own interest Long confinement had made his face too pale his form too thin moreover the trader had heard something of his character and it did not strike him as suitable for a slave He said he would give any price if the handsome lad was a girl We thanked God that he was not Could you have seen that mother clinging to her child when they fastened the irons upon his wrists could you have heard her heart-rending groans and seen her bloodshot eyes wander wildly from face to face vainly pleading for mercy could you have witnessed that scene as I saw it you would exclaim Slavery is damnable Benjamin her youngest her pet was forever gone She could not realize it She had had an interview with the trader for the purpose of ascertaining if Benjamin could be purchased She was told it was impossible as he had given bonds not to sell him till he was out of the state He promised that he would not sell him till he reached New Orleans With a strong arm and unvaried trust my grandmother began her work of love Benjamin must be free If she succeeded she knew they would still be separated but the sacrifice was not too great Day and night she labored The trader's price would treble that he gave but she was not discouraged She employed a lawyer to write to a gentleman whom she knew in New Orleans She begged him to interest himself for Benjamin and he willingly favored her request When he saw Benjamin and stated his business he thanked him but said he preferred to wait a while before making the trader an offer He knew he had tried to obtain a high price for him and had invariably failed This encouraged him to make another effort for freedom So one morning long before day Benjamin was missing He was riding over the blue billows bound for Baltimore For once his white face did him a kindly service They had no suspicion that it belonged to a slave otherwise the law would have been followed out to the letter and the thing rendered back to slavery The brightest skies are often overshadowed by the darkest clouds Benjamin was taken sick and compelled to remain in Baltimore three weeks His strength was slow in returning and his desire to continue his journey seemed to retard his recovery How could he get strength without air and exercise He resolved to venture on a short walk A by-street was selected where he thought himself secure of not being met by any one that knew him but a voice called out Halloo Ben my boy what are you doing here His first impulse was to run but his legs trembled so that he could not stir He turned to confront his antagonist and behold there stood his old master's next door neighbor He thought it was all over with him now but it proved otherwise That man was a miracle He possessed a goodly number of slaves and yet was not quite deaf to that mystic clock whose ticking is rarely heard in the slaveholder's breast Ben you are sick said he Why you look like a ghost I guess I gave you something of a start Never mind Ben I am not going to touch you You had a pretty tough time of it and you may go on your way rejoicing for all me But I would advise you to get out of this place plaguy quick for there are several gentlemen here from our town He described the nearest and safest route to New York and added I shall be glad to tell your mother I have seen you Good by Ben Benjamin turned away filled with gratitude and surprised that the town he hated contained such a gema gem worthy of a purer setting This gentleman was a Northerner by birth and had married a southern lady On his return he told my grandmother that he had seen her son and of the service he had rendered him Benjamin reached New York safely and concluded to stop there until he had gained strength enough to proceed further It happened that my grandmother's only remaining son had sailed for the same city on business for his mistress Through God's providence the brothers met You may be sure it was a happy meeting O Phil exclaimed Benjamin I am here at last Then he told him how near he came to dying almost in sight of free land and how he prayed that he might live to get one breath of free air He said life was worth something now and it would be hard to die In the old jail he had not valued it once he was tempted to destroy it but something he did not know what had prevented him perhaps it was fear He had heard those who profess to be religious declare there was no heaven for self-murderers and as his life had been pretty hot here he did not desire a continuation of the same in another world If I die now he exclaimed thank God I shall die a freeman He begged my uncle Phillip not to return south but stay and work with him till they earned enough to buy those at home His brother told him it would kill their mother if he deserted her in her trouble She had pledged her house and with difficulty had raised money to buy him Would he be bought No never he replied Do you suppose Phil when I have got so far out of their clutches I will give them one red cent No And do you suppose I would turn mother out of her home in her old age That I would let her pay all those hard-earned dollars for me and never to see me For you know she will stay south as long as her other children are slaves What a good mother Tell her to buy you Phil You have been a comfort to her and I have been a trouble And Linda poor Linda what'll become of her Phil you don't know what a life they lead her She has told me something about it and I wish old Flint was dead or a better man When I was in jail he asked her if she didn't want him to ask my master to forgive me and take me home again She told him No that I didn't want to go back He got mad and said we were all alike I never despised my own master half as much as I do that man There is many a worse slaveholder than my master but for all that I would not be his slave While Benjamin was sick he had parted with nearly all his clothes to pay necessary expenses But he did not part with a little pin I fastened in his bosom when we parted It was the most valuable thing I owned and I thought none more worthy to wear it He had it still His brother furnished him with clothes and gave him what money he had They parted with moistened eyes and as Benjamin turned away he said Phil I part with all my kindred And so it proved We never heard from him again Uncle Phillip came home and the first words he uttered when he entered the house were Mother Ben is free I have seen him in New York She stood looking at him with a bewildered air Mother don't you believe it he said laying his hand softly upon her shoulder She raised her hands and exclaimed God be praised Let us thank him She dropped on her knees and poured forth her heart in prayer Then Phillip must sit down and repeat to her every word Benjamin had said He told her all only he forbore to mention how sick and pale her darling looked Why should he distress her when she could do him no good The brave old woman still toiled on hoping to rescue some of her other children After a while she succeeded in buying Phillip She paid eight hundred dollars and came home with the precious document that secured his freedom The happy mother and son sat together by the old hearthstone that night telling how proud they were of each other and how they would prove to the world that they could take care of themselves as they had long taken care of others We all concluded by saying He that is willing to be a slave let him be a slave V THE TRIALS OF GIRLHOOD DURING the first years of my service in Dr Flint's family I was accustomed to share some indulgences with the children of my mistress Though this seemed to me no more than right I was grateful for it and tried to merit the kindness by the faithful discharge of my duties But I now entered on my fifteenth yeara sad epoch in the life of a slave girl My master began to whisper foul words in my ear Young as I was I could not remain ignorant of their import I tried to treat them with indifference or contempt The master's age my extreme youth and the fear that his conduct would be reported to my grandmother made him bear this treatment for many months He was a crafty man and resorted to many means to accomplish his purposes Sometimes he had stormy terrific ways that made his victims tremble sometimes he assumed a gentleness that he thought must surely subdue Of the two I preferred his stormy moods although they left me trembling He tried his utmost to corrupt the pure principles my grandmother had instilled He peopled my young mind with unclean images such as only a vile monster could think of I turned from him with disgust and hatred But he was my master I was compelled to live under the same roof with himwhere I saw a man forty years my senior daily violating the most sacred commandments of nature He told me I was his property that I must be subject to his will in all things My soul revolted against the mean tyranny But where could I turn for protection No matter whether the slave girl be as black as ebony or as fair as her mistress In either case there is no shadow of law to protect her from insult from violence or even from death all these are inflicted by fiends who bear the shape of men The mistress who ought to protect the helpless victim has no other feelings towards her but those of jealousy and rage The degradation the wrongs the vices that grow out of slavery are more than I can describe They are greater than you would willingly believe Surely if you credited one half the truths that are told you concerning the helpless millions suffering in this cruel bondage you at the north would not help to tighten the yoke You surely would refuse to do for the master on your own soil the mean and cruel work which trained bloodhounds and the lowest class of whites do for him at the south Every where the years bring to all enough of sin and sorrow but in slavery the very dawn of life is darkened by these shadows Even the little child who is accustomed to wait on her mistress and her children will learn before she is twelve years old why it is that her mistress hates such and such a one among the slaves Perhaps the child's own mother is among those hated ones She listens to violent outbreaks of jealous passion and cannot help understanding what is the cause She will become prematurely knowing in evil things Soon she will learn to tremble when she hears her master's footfall She will be compelled to realize that she is no longer a child If God has bestowed beauty upon her it will prove her greatest curse That which commands admiration in the white woman only hastens the degradation of the female slave I know that some are too much brutalized by slavery to feel the humiliation of their position but many slaves feel it most acutely and shrink from the memory of it I cannot tell how much I suffered in the presence of these wrongs nor how I am still pained by the retrospect My master met me at every turn reminding me that I belonged to him and swearing by heaven and earth that he would compel me to submit to him If I went out for a breath of fresh air after a day of unwearied toil his footsteps dogged me If I knelt by my mother's grave his dark shadow fell on me even there The light heart which nature had given me became heavy with sad forebodings The other slaves in my master's house noticed the change Many of them pitied me but none dared to ask the cause They had no need to inquire They knew too well the guilty practices under that roof and they were aware that to speak of them was an offence that never went unpunished I longed for some one to confide in I would have given the world to have laid my head on my grandmother's faithful bosom and told her all my troubles But Dr Flint swore he would kill me if I was not as silent as the grave Then although my grandmother was all in all to me I feared her as well as loved her I had been accustomed to look up to her with a respect bordering upon awe I was very young and felt shamefaced about telling her such impure things especially as I knew her to be very strict on such subjects Moreover she was a woman of a high spirit She was usually very quiet in her demeanor but if her indignation was once roused it was not very easily quelled I had been told that she once chased a white gentleman with a loaded pistol because he insulted one of her daughters I dreaded the consequences of a violent outbreak and both pride and fear kept me silent But though I did not confide in my grandmother and even evaded her vigilant watchfulness and inquiry her presence in the neighborhood was some protection to me Though she had been a slave Dr Flint was afraid of her He dreaded her scorching rebukes Moreover she was known and patronized by many people and he did not wish to have his villany made public It was lucky for me that I did not live on a distant plantation but in a town not so large that the inhabitants were ignorant of each other's affairs Bad as are the laws and customs in a slaveholding community the doctor as a professional man deemed it prudent to keep up some outward show of decency O what days and nights of fear and sorrow that man caused me Reader it is not to awaken sympathy for myself that I am telling you truthfully what I suffered in slavery I do it to kindle a flame of compassion in your hearts for my sisters who are still in bondage suffering as I once suffered I once saw two beautiful children playing together One was a fair white child the other was her slave and also her sister When I saw them embracing each other and heard their joyous laughter I turned sadly away from the lovely sight I foresaw the inevitable blight that would fall on the little slave's heart I knew how soon her laughter would be changed to sighs The fair child grew up to be a still fairer woman From childhood to womanhood her pathway was blooming with flowers and overarched by a sunny sky Scarcely one day of her life had been clouded when the sun rose on her happy bridal morning How had those years dealt with her slave sister the little playmate of her childhood She also was very beautiful but the flowers and sunshine of love were not for her She drank the cup of sin and shame and misery whereof her persecuted race are compelled to drink In view of these things why are ye silent ye free men and women of the north Why do your tongues falter in maintenance of the right Would that I had more ability But my heart is so full and my pen is so weak There are noble men and women who plead for us striving to help those who cannot help themselves God bless them God give them strength and courage to go on God bless those every where who are laboring to advance the cause of humanity VI THE JEALOUS MISTRESS I WOULD ten thousand times rather that my children should be the half-starved paupers of Ireland than to be the most pampered among the slaves of America I would rather drudge out my life on a cotton plantation till the grave opened to give me rest than to live with an unprincipled master and a jealous mistress The felon's home in a penitentiary is preferable He may repent and turn from the error of his ways and so find peace but it is not so with a favorite slave She is not allowed to have any pride of character It is deemed a crime in her to wish to be virtuous Mrs Flint possessed the key to her husband's character before I was born She might have used this knowledge to counsel and to screen the young and the innocent among her slaves but for them she had no sympathy They were the objects of her constant suspicion and malevolence She watched her husband with unceasing vigilance but he was well practiced in means to evade it What he could not find opportunity to say in words he manifested in signs He invented more than were ever thought of in a deaf and dumb asylum I let them pass as if I did not understand what he meant and many were the curses and threats bestowed on me for my stupidity One day he caught me teaching myself to write He frowned as if he was not well pleased but I suppose he came to the conclusion that such an accomplishment might help to advance his favorite scheme Before long notes were often slipped into my hand I would return them saying I can't read them sir Can't you he replied then I must read them to you He always finished the reading by asking Do you understand Sometimes he would complain of the heat of the tea room and order his supper to be placed on a small table in the piazza He would seat himself there with a well-satisfied smile and tell me to stand by and brush away the flies He would eat very slowly pausing between the mouthfuls These intervals were employed in describing the happiness I was so foolishly throwing away and in threatening me with the penalty that finally awaited my stubborn disobedience He boasted much of the forbearance he had exercised towards me and reminded me that there was a limit to his patience When I succeeded in avoiding opportunities for him to talk to me at home I was ordered to come to his office to do some errand When there I was obliged to stand and listen to such language as he saw fit to address to me Sometimes I so openly expressed my contempt for him that he would become violently enraged and I wondered why he did not strike me Circumstanced as he was he probably thought it was better policy to be forbearing But the state of things grew worse and worse daily In desperation I told him that I must and would apply to my grandmother for protection He threatened me with death and worse than death if I made any complaint to her Strange to say I did not despair I was naturally of a buoyant disposition and always I had hope of somehow getting out of his clutches Like many a poor simple slave before me I trusted that some threads of joy would yet be woven into my dark destiny I had entered my sixteenth year and every day it became more apparent that my presence was intolerable to Mrs Flint Angry words frequently passed between her and her husband He had never punished me himself and he would not allow any body else to punish me In that respect she was never satisfied but in her angry moods no terms were too vile for her to bestow upon me Yet I whom she detested so bitterly had far more pity for her than he had whose duty it was to make her life happy I never wronged her or wished to wrong her and one word of kindness from her would have brought me to her feet After repeated quarrels between the doctor and his wife he announced his intention to take his youngest daughter then four years old to sleep in his apartment It was necessary that a servant should sleep in the same room to be on hand if the child stirred I was selected for that office and informed for what purpose that arrangement had been made By managing to keep within sight of people as much as possible during the day time I had hitherto succeeded in eluding my master though a razor was often held to my throat to force me to change this line of policy At night I slept by the side of my great aunt where I felt safe He was too prudent to come into her room She was an old woman and had been in the family many years Moreover as a married man and a professional man he deemed it necessary to save appearances in some degree But he resolved to remove the obstacle in the way of his scheme and he thought he had planned it so that he should evade suspicion He was well aware how much I prized my refuge by the side of my old aunt and he determined to dispossess me of it The first night the doctor had the little child in his room alone The next morning I was ordered to take my station as nurse the following night A kind Providence interposed in my favor During the day Mrs Flint heard of this new arrangement and a storm followed I rejoiced to hear it rage After a while my mistress sent for me to come to her room Her first question was Did you know you were to sleep in the doctor's room Yes ma'am Who told you My master Will you answer truly all the questions I ask Yes ma'am Tell me then as you hope to be forgiven are you innocent of what I have accused you I am She handed me a Bible and said Lay your hand on your heart kiss this holy book and swear before God that you tell me the truth I took the oath she required and I did it with a clear conscience You have taken God's holy word to testify your innocence said she If you have deceived me beware Now take this stool sit down look me directly in the face and tell me all that has passed between your master and you I did as she ordered As I went on with my account her color changed frequently she wept and sometimes groaned She spoke in tones so sad that I was touched by her grief The tears came to my eyes but I was soon convinced that her emotions arose from anger and wounded pride She felt that her marriage vows were desecrated her dignity insulted but she had no compassion for the poor victim of her husband's perfidy She pitied herself as a martyr but she was incapable of feeling for the condition of shame and misery in which her unfortunate helpless slave was placed Yet perhaps she had some touch of feeling for me for when the conference was ended she spoke kindly and promised to protect me I should have been much comforted by this assurance if I could have had confidence in it but my experiences in slavery had filled me with distrust She was not a very refined woman and had not much control over her passions I was an object of her jealousy and consequently of her hatred and I knew I could not expect kindness or confidence from her under the circumstances in which I was placed I could not blame her Slave-holders' wives feel as other women would under similar circumstances The fire of her temper kindled from small sparks and now the flame became so intense that the doctor was obliged to give up his intended arrangement I knew I had ignited the torch and I expected to suffer for it afterwards but I felt too thankful to my mistress for the timely aid she rendered me to care much about that She now took me to sleep in a room adjoining her own There I was an object of her especial care though not of her especial comfort for she spent many a sleepless night to watch over me Sometimes I woke up and found her bending over me At other times she whispered in my ear as though it was her husband who was speaking to me and listened to hear what I would answer If she startled me on such occasions she would glide stealthily away and the next morning she would tell me I had been talking in my sleep and ask who I was talking to At last I began to be fearful for my life It had been often threatened and you can imagine better than I can describe what an unpleasant sensation it must produce to wake up in the dead of night and find a jealous woman bending over you Terrible as this experience was I had fears that it would give place to one more terrible My mistress grew weary of her vigils they did not prove satisfactory She changed her tactics She now tried the trick of accusing my master of crime in my presence and gave my name as the author of the accusation To my utter astonishment he replied I don't believe it but if she did acknowledge it you tortured her into exposing me Tortured into exposing him Truly Satan had no difficulty in distinguishing the color of his soul I understood his object in making this false representation It was to show me that I gained nothing by seeking the protection of my mistress that the power was still all in his own hands I pitied Mrs Flint She was a second wife many years the junior of her husband and the hoary-headed miscreant was enough to try the patience of a wiser and better woman She was completely foiled and knew not how to proceed She would gladly have had me flogged for my supposed false oath but as I have already stated the doctor never allowed any one to whip me The old sinner was politic The application of the lash might have led to remarks that would have exposed him in the eyes of his children and grandchildren How often did I rejoice that I lived in a town where all the inhabitants knew each other If I had been on a remote plantation or lost among the multitude of a crowded city I should not be a living woman at this day The secrets of slavery are concealed like those of the Inquisition My master was to my knowledge the father of eleven slaves But did the mothers dare to tell who was the father of their children Did the other slaves dare to allude to it except in whispers among themselves No indeed They knew too well the terrible consequences My grandmother could not avoid seeing things which excited her suspicions She was uneasy about me and tried various ways to buy me but the never-changing answer was always repeated Linda does not belong to me She is my daughter's property and I have no legal right to sell her The conscientious man He was too scrupulous to sell me but he had no scruples whatever about committing a much greater wrong against the helpless young girl placed under his guardianship as his daughter's property Sometimes my persecutor would ask me whether I would like to be sold I told him I would rather be sold to any body than to lead such a life as I did On such occasions he would assume the air of a very injured individual and reproach me for my ingratitude Did I not take you into the house and make you the companion of my own children he would say Have I ever treated you like a negro I have never allowed you to be punished not even to please your mistress And this is the recompense I get you ungrateful girl I answered that he had reasons of his own for screening me from punishment and that the course he pursued made my mistress hate me and persecute me If I wept he would say Poor child Don't cry don't cry I will make peace for you with your mistress Only let me arrange matters in my own way Poor foolish girl you don't know what is for your own good I would cherish you I would make a lady of you Now go and think of all I have promised you I did think of it Reader I draw no imaginary pictures of southern homes I am telling you the plain truth Yet when victims make their escape from this wild beast of Slavery northerners consent to act the part of bloodhounds and hunt the poor fugitive back into his den full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness Nay more they are not only willing but proud to give their daughters in marriage to slaveholders The poor girls have romantic notions of a sunny clime and of the flowering vines that all the year round shade a happy home To what disappointments are they destined The young wife soon learns that the husband in whose hands she has placed her happiness pays no regard to his marriage vows Children of every shade of complexion play with her own fair babies and too well she knows that they are born unto him of his own household Jealousy and hatred enter the flowery home and it is ravaged of its loveliness Southern women often marry a man knowing that he is the father of many little slaves They do not trouble themselves about it They regard such children as property as marketable as the pigs on the plantation and it is seldom that they do not make them aware of this by passing them into the slave-trader's hands as soon as possible and thus getting them out of their sight I am glad to say there are some honorable exceptions I have myself known two southern wives who exhorted their husbands to free those slaves towards whom they stood in a parental relation and their request was granted These husbands blushed before the superior nobleness of their wives' natures Though they had only counselled them to do that which it was their duty to do it commanded their respect and rendered their conduct more exemplary Concealment was at an end and confidence took the place of distrust Though this bad institution deadens the moral sense even in white women to a fearful extent it is not altogether extinct I have heard southern ladies say of Mr Such a one He not only thinks it no disgrace to be the father of those little niggers but he is not ashamed to call himself their master I declare such things ought not to be tolerated in any decent society VII THE LOVER WHY does the slave ever love Why allow the tendrils of the heart to twine around objects which may at any moment be wrenched away by the hand of violence When separations come by the hand of death the pious soul can bow in resignation and say Not my will but thine be done O Lord But when the ruthless hand of man strikes the blow regardless of the misery he causes it is hard to be submissive I did not reason thus when I was a young girl Youth will be youth I loved and I indulged the hope that the dark clouds around me would turn out a bright lining I forgot that in the land of my birth the shadows are too dense for light to penetrate A land Where laughter is not mirth nor thought the mind Nor words a language nor e'en men mankind Where cries reply to curses shrieks to blows And each is tortured in his separate hell There was in the neighborhood a young colored carpenter a free born man We had been well acquainted in childhood and frequently met together afterwards We became mutually attached and he proposed to marry me I loved him with all the ardor of a young girl's first love But when I reflected that I was a slave and that the laws gave no sanction to the marriage of such my heart sank within me My lover wanted to buy me but I knew that Dr Flint was too wilful and arbitrary a man to consent to that arrangement From him I was sure of experiencing all sorts of opposition and I had nothing to hope from my mistress She would have been delighted to have got rid of me but not in that way It would have relieved her mind of a burden if she could have seen me sold to some distant state but if I was married near home I should be just as much in her husband's power as I had previously beenfor the husband of a slave has no power to protect her Moreover my mistress like many others seemed to think that slaves had no right to any family ties of their own that they were created merely to wait upon the family of the mistress I once heard her abuse a young slave girl who told her that a colored man wanted to make her his wife I will have you peeled and pickled my lady said she if I ever hear you mention that subject again Do you suppose that I will have you tending my children with the children of that nigger The girl to whom she said this had a mulatto child of course not acknowledged by its father The poor black man who loved her would have been proud to acknowledge his helpless offspring Many and anxious were the thoughts I revolved in my mind I was at a loss what to do Above all things I was desirous to spare my lover the insults that had cut so deeply into my own soul I talked with my grandmother about it and partly told her my fears I did not dare to tell her the worst She had long suspected all was not right and if I confirmed her suspicions I knew a storm would rise that would prove the overthrow of all my hopes This love-dream had been my support through many trials and I could not bear to run the risk of having it suddenly dissipated There was a lady in the neighborhood a particular friend of Dr Flint's who often visited the house I had a great respect for her and she had always manifested a friendly interest in me Grandmother thought she would have great influence with the doctor I went to this lady and told her my story I told her I was aware that my lover's being a free-born man would prove a great objection but he wanted to buy me and if Dr Flint would consent to that arrangement I felt sure he would be willing to pay any reasonable price She knew that Mrs Flint disliked me therefore I ventured to suggest that perhaps my mistress would approve of my being sold as that would rid her of me The lady listened with kindly sympathy and promised to do her utmost to promote my wishes She had an interview with the doctor and I believe she pleaded my cause earnestly but it was all to no purpose How I dreaded my master now Every minute I expected to be summoned to his presence but the day passed and I heard nothing from him The next morning a message was brought to me Master wants you in his study I found the door ajar and I stood a moment gazing at the hateful man who claimed a right to rule me body and soul I entered and tried to appear calm I did not want him to know how my heart was bleeding He looked fixedly at me with an expression which seemed to say I have half a mind to kill you on the spot At last he broke the silence and that was a relief to both of us So you want to be married do you said he and to a free nigger Yes sir Well I'll soon convince you whether I am your master or the nigger fellow you honor so highly If you must have a husband you may take up with one of my slaves What a situation I should be in as the wife of one of his slaves even if my heart had been interested I replied Don't you suppose sir that a slave can have some preference about marrying Do you suppose that all men are alike to her Do you love this nigger said he abruptly Yes sir How dare you tell me so he exclaimed in great wrath After a slight pause he added I supposed you thought more of yourself that you felt above the insults of such puppies I replied If he is a puppy I am a puppy for we are both of the negro race It is right and honorable for us to love each other The man you call a puppy never insulted me sir and he would not love me if he did not believe me to be a virtuous woman He sprang upon me like a tiger and gave me a stunning blow It was the first time he had ever struck me and fear did not enable me to control my anger When I had recovered a little from the effects I exclaimed You have struck me for answering you honestly How I despise you There was silence for some minutes Perhaps he was deciding what should be my punishment or perhaps he wanted to give me time to reflect on what I had said and to whom I had said it Finally he asked Do you know what you have said Yes sir but your treatment drove me to it Do you know that I have a right to do as I like with youthat I can kill you if I please You have tried to kill me and I wish you had but you have no right to do as you like with me Silence he exclaimed in a thundering voice By heavens girl you forget yourself too far Are you mad If you are I will soon bring you to your senses Do you think any other master would bear what I have borne from you this morning Many masters would have killed you on the spot How would you like to be sent to jail for your insolence I know I have been disrespectful sir I replied but you drove me to it I couldn't help it As for the jail there would be more peace for me there than there is here You deserve to go there said he and to be under such treatment that you would forget the meaning of the word peace It would do you good It would take some of your high notions out of you But I am not ready to send you there yet notwithstanding your ingratitude for all my kindness and forbearance You have been the plague of my life I have wanted to make you happy and I have been repaid with the basest ingratitude but though you have proved yourself incapable of appreciating my kindness I will be lenient towards you Linda I will give you one more chance to redeem your character If you behave yourself and do as I require I will forgive you and treat you as I always have done but if you disobey me I will punish you as I would the meanest slave on my plantation Never let me hear that fellow's name mentioned again If I ever know of your speaking to him I will cowhide you both and if I catch him lurking about my premises I will shoot him as soon as I would a dog Do you hear what I say I'll teach you a lesson about marriage and free niggers Now go and let this be the last time I have occasion to speak to you on this subject Reader did you ever hate I hope not I never did but once and I trust I never shall again Somebody has called it the atmosphere of hell and I believe it is so For a fortnight the doctor did not speak to me He thought to mortify me to make me feel that I had disgraced myself by receiving the honorable addresses of a respectable colored man in preference to the base proposals of a white man But though his lips disdained to address me his eyes were very loquacious No animal ever watched its prey more narrowly than he watched me He knew that I could write though he had failed to make me read his letters and he was now troubled lest I should exchange letters with another man After a while he became weary of silence and I was sorry for it One morning as he passed through the hall to leave the house he contrived to thrust a note into my hand I thought I had better read it and spare myself the vexation of having him read it to me It expressed regret for the blow he had given me and reminded me that I myself was wholly to blame for it He hoped I had become convinced of the injury I was doing myself by incurring his displeasure He wrote that he had made up his mind to go to Louisiana that he should take several slaves with him and intended I should be one of the number My mistress would remain where she was therefore I should have nothing to fear from that quarter If I merited kindness from him he assured me that it would be lavishly bestowed He begged me to think over the matter and answer the following day The next morning I was called to carry a pair of scissors to his room I laid them on the table with the letter beside them He thought it was my answer and did not call me back I went as usual to attend my young mistress to and from school He met me in the street and ordered me to stop at his office on my way back When I entered he showed me his letter and asked me why I had not answered it I replied I am your daughter's property and it is in your power to send me or take me wherever you please He said he was very glad to find me so willing to go and that we should start early in the autumn He had a large practice in the town and I rather thought he had made up the story merely to frighten me However that might be I was determined that I would never go to Louisiana with him Summer passed away and early in the autumn Dr Flint's eldest son was sent to Louisiana to examine the country with a view to emigrating That news did not disturb me I knew very well that I should not be sent with him That I had not been taken to the plantation before this time was owing to the fact that his son was there He was jealous of his son and jealousy of the overseer had kept him from punishing me by sending me into the fields to work Is it strange that I was not proud of these protectors As for the overseer he was a man for whom I had less respect than I had for a bloodhound Young Mr Flint did not bring back a favorable report of Louisiana and I heard no more of that scheme Soon after this my lover met me at the corner of the street and I stopped to speak to him Looking up I saw my master watching us from his window I hurried home trembling with fear I was sent for immediately to go to his room He met me with a blow When is mistress to be married said he in a sneering tone A shower of oaths and imprecations followed How thankful I was that my lover was a free man that my tyrant had no power to flog him for speaking to me in the street Again and again I revolved in my mind how all this would end There was no hope that the doctor would consent to sell me on any terms He had an iron will and was determined to keep me and to conquer me My lover was an intelligent and religious man Even if he could have obtained permission to marry me while I was a slave the marriage would give him no power to protect me from my master It would have made him miserable to witness the insults I should have been subjected to And then if we had children I knew they must follow the condition of the mother What a terrible blight that would be on the heart of a free intelligent father For his sake I felt that I ought not to link his fate with my own unhappy destiny He was going to Savannah to see about a little property left him by an uncle and hard as it was to bring my feelings to it I earnestly entreated him not to come back I advised him to go to the Free States where his tongue would not be tied and where his intelligence would be of more avail to him He left me still hoping the day would come when I could be bought With me the lamp of hope had gone out The dream of my girlhood was over I felt lonely and desolate Still I was not stripped of all I still had my good grandmother and my affectionate brother When he put his arms round my neck and looked into my eyes as if to read there the troubles I dared not tell I felt that I still had something to love But even that pleasant emotion was chilled by the reflection that he might be torn from me at any moment by some sudden freak of my master If he had known how we loved each other I think he would have exulted in separating us We often planned together how we could get to the north But as William remarked such things are easier said than done My movements were very closely watched and we had no means of getting any money to defray our expenses As for grandmother she was strongly opposed to her children's undertaking any such project She had not forgotten poor Benjamin's sufferings and she was afraid that if another child tried to escape he would have a similar or a worse fate To me nothing seemed more dreadful than my present life I said to myself William must be free He shall go to the north and I will follow him Many a slave sister has formed the same plans VIII WHAT SLAVES ARE TAUGHT TO THINK OF THE NORTH SLAVEHOLDERS pride themselves upon being honorable men but if you were to hear the enormous lies they tell their slaves you would have small respect for their veracity I have spoken plain English Pardon me I cannot use a milder term When they visit the north and return home they tell their slaves of the runaways they have seen and describe them to be in the most deplorable condition A slaveholder once told me that he had seen a runaway friend of mine in New York and that she besought him to take her back to her master for she was literally dying of starvation that many days she had only one cold potato to eat and at other times could get nothing at all He said he refused to take her because he knew her master would not thank him for bringing such a miserable wretch to his house He ended by saying to me This is the punishment she brought on herself for running away from a kind master This whole story was false I afterwards staid with that friend in New York and found her in comfortable circumstances She had never thought of such a thing as wishing to go back to slavery Many of the slaves believe such stories and think it is not worth while to exchange slavery for such a hard kind of freedom It is difficult to persuade such that freedom could make them useful men and enable them to protect their wives and children If those heathen in our Christian land had as much teaching as some Hindoos they would think otherwise They would know that liberty is more valuable than life They would begin to understand their own capabilities and exert themselves to become men and women But while the Free States sustain a law which hurls fugitives back into slavery how can the slaves resolve to become men There are some who strive to protect wives and daughters from the insults of their masters but those who have such sentiments have had advantages above the general mass of slaves They have been partially civilized and Christianized by favorable circumstances Some are bold enough to utter such sentiments to their masters O that there were more of them Some poor creatures have been so brutalized by the lash that they will sneak out of the way to give their masters free access to their wives and daughters Do you think this proves the black man to belong to an inferior order of beings What would you be if you had been born and brought up a slave with generations of slaves for ancestors I admit that the black man is inferior But what is it that makes him so It is the ignorance in which white men compel him to live it is the torturing whip that lashes manhood out of him it is the fierce bloodhounds of the South and the scarcely less cruel human bloodhounds of the north who enforce the Fugitive Slave Law They do the work Southern gentlemen indulge in the most contemptuous expressions about the Yankees while they on their part consent to do the vilest work for them such as the ferocious bloodhounds and the despised negro-hunters are employed to do at home When southerners go to the north they are proud to do them honor but the northern man is not welcome south of Mason Dixon's line unless he suppresses every thought and feeling at variance with their peculiar institution Nor is it enough to be silent The masters are not pleased unless they obtain a greater degree of subservience than that and they are generally accommodated Do they respect the northerner for this I trow not Even the slaves despise a northern man with southern principles and that is the class they generally see When northerners go to the south to reside they prove very apt scholars They soon imbibe the sentiments and disposition of their neighbors and generally go beyond their teachers Of the two they are proverbially the hardest masters They seem to satisfy their consciences with the doctrine that God created the Africans to be slaves What a libel upon the heavenly Father who made of one blood all nations of men And then who are Africans Who can measure the amount of Anglo-Saxon blood coursing in the veins of American slaves I have spoken of the pains slaveholders take to give their slaves a bad opinion of the north but notwithstanding this intelligent slaves are aware that they have many friends in the Free States Even the most ignorant have some confused notions about it They knew that I could read and I was often asked if I had seen any thing in the newspapers about white folks over in the big north who were trying to get their freedom for them Some believe that the abolitionists have already made them free and that it is established by law but that their masters prevent the law from going into effect One woman begged me to get a newspaper and read it over She said her husband told her that the black people had sent word to the queen of 'Merica that they were all slaves that she didn't believe it and went to Washington city to see the president about it They quarrelled she drew her sword upon him and swore that he should help her to make them all free That poor ignorant woman thought that America was governed by a Queen to whom the President was subordinate I wish the President was subordinate to Queen Justice IX SKETCHES OF NEIGHBORING SLAVEHOLDERS THERE was a planter in the country not far from us whom I will call Mr Litch He was an ill-bred uneducated man but very wealthy He had six hundred slaves many of whom he did not know by sight His extensive plantation was managed by well-paid overseers There was a jail and a whipping post on his grounds and whatever cruelties were perpetrated there they passed without comment He was so effectually screened by his great wealth that he was called to no account for his crimes not even for murder Various were the punishments resorted to A favorite one was to tie a rope round a man's body and suspend him from the ground A fire was kindled over him from which was suspended a piece of fat pork As this cooked the scalding drops of fat continually fell on the bare flesh On his own plantation he required very strict obedience to the eighth commandment But depredations on the neighbors were allowable provided the culprit managed to evade detection or suspicion If a neighbor brought a charge of theft against any of his slaves he was browbeaten by the master who assured him that his slaves had enough of every thing at home and had no inducement to steal No sooner was the neighbor's back turned than the accused was sought out and whipped for his lack of discretion If a slave stole from him even a pound of meat or a peck of corn if detection followed he was put in chains and imprisoned and so kept till his form was attenuated by hunger and suffering A freshet once bore his wine cellar and meat house miles away from the plantation Some slaves followed and secured bits of meat and bottles of wine Two were detected a ham and some liquor being found in their huts They were summoned by their master No words were used but a club felled them to the ground A rough box was their coffin and their interment was a dog's burial Nothing was said Murder was so common on his plantation that he feared to be alone after nightfall He might have believed in ghosts His brother if not equal in wealth was at least equal in cruelty His bloodhounds were well trained Their pen was spacious and a terror to the slaves They were let loose on a runaway and if they tracked him they literally tore the flesh from his bones When this slaveholder died his shrieks and groans were so frightful that they appalled his own friends His last words were I am going to hell bury my money with me After death his eyes remained open To press the lids down silver dollars were laid on them These were buried with him From this circumstance a rumor went abroad that his coffin was filled with money Three times his grave was opened and his coffin taken out The last time his body was found on the ground and a flock of buzzards were pecking at it He was again interred and a sentinel set over his grave The perpetrators were never discovered Cruelty is contagious in uncivilized communities Mr Conant a neighbor of Mr Litch returned from town one evening in a partial state of intoxication His body servant gave him some offence He was divested of his clothes except his shirt whipped and tied to a large tree in front of the house It was a stormy night in winter The wind blew bitterly cold and the boughs of the old tree crackled under falling sleet A member of the family fearing he would freeze to death begged that he might be taken down but the master would not relent He remained there three hours and when he was cut down he was more dead than alive Another slave who stole a pig from this master to appease his hunger was terribly flogged In desperation he tried to run away But at the end of two miles he was so faint with loss of blood he thought he was dying He had a wife and he longed to see her once more Too sick to walk he crept back that long distance on his hands and knees When he reached his master's it was night He had not strength to rise and open the gate He moaned and tried to call for help I had a friend living in the same family At last his cry reached her She went out and found the prostrate man at the gate She ran back to the house for assistance and two men returned with her They carried him in and laid him on the floor The back of his shirt was one clot of blood By means of lard my friend loosened it from the raw flesh She bandaged him gave him cool drink and left him to rest The master said he deserved a hundred more lashes When his own labor was stolen from him he had stolen food to appease his hunger This was his crime Another neighbor was a Mrs Wade At no hour of the day was there cessation of the lash on her premises Her labors began with the dawn and did not cease till long after nightfall The barn was her particular place of torture There she lashed the slaves with the might of a man An old slave of hers once said to me It is hell in missis's house 'Pears I can never get out Day and night I prays to die The mistress died before the old woman and when dying entreated her husband not to permit any one of her slaves to look on her after death A slave who had nursed her children and had still a child in her care watched her chance and stole with it in her arms to the room where lay her dead mistress She gazed a while on her then raised her hand and dealt two blows on her face saying as she did so The devil is got you now She forgot that the child was looking on She had just begun to talk and she said to her father I did see ma and mammy did strike ma so striking her own face with her little hand The master was startled He could not imagine how the nurse could obtain access to the room where the corpse lay for he kept the door locked He questioned her She confessed that what the child had said was true and told how she had procured the key She was sold to Georgia In my childhood I knew a valuable slave named Charity and loved her as all children did Her young mistress married and took her to Louisiana Her little boy James was sold to a good sort of master He became involved in debt and James was sold again to a wealthy slaveholder noted for his cruelty With this man he grew up to manhood receiving the treatment of a dog After a severe whipping to save himself from further infliction of the lash with which he was threatened he took to the woods He was in a most miserable conditioncut by the cowskin half naked half starved and without the means of procuring a crust of bread Some weeks after his escape he was captured tied and carried back to his master's plantation This man considered punishment in his jail on bread and water after receiving hundreds of lashes too mild for the poor slave's offence Therefore he decided after the overseer should have whipped him to his satisfaction to have him placed between the screws of the cotton gin to stay as long as he had been in the woods This wretched creature was cut with the whip from his head to his foot then washed with strong brine to prevent the flesh from mortifying and make it heal sooner than it otherwise would He was then put into the cotton gin which was screwed down only allowing him room to turn on his side when he could not lie on his back Every morning a slave was sent with a piece of bread and bowl of water which were placed within reach of the poor fellow The slave was charged under penalty of severe punishment not to speak to him Four days passed and the slave continued to carry the bread and water On the second morning he found the bread gone but the water untouched When he had been in the press four days and five nights the slave informed his master that the water had not been used for four mornings and that a horrible stench came from the gin house The overseer was sent to examine into it When the press was unscrewed the dead body was found partly eaten by rats and vermin Perhaps the rats that devoured his bread had gnawed him before life was extinct Poor Charity Grandmother and I often asked each other how her affectionate heart would bear the news if she should ever hear of the murder of her son We had known her husband and knew that James was like him in manliness and intelligence These were the qualities that made it so hard for him to be a plantation slave They put him into a rough box and buried him with less feeling than would have been manifested for an old house dog Nobody asked any questions He was a slave and the feeling was that the master had a right to do what he pleased with his own property And what did he care for the value of a slave He had hundreds of them When they had finished their daily toil they must hurry to eat their little morsels and be ready to extinguish their pine knots before nine o'clock when the overseer went his patrol rounds He entered every cabin to see that men and their wives had gone to bed together lest the men from over-fatigue should fall asleep in the chimney corner and remain there till the morning horn called them to their daily task Women are considered of no value unless they continually increase their owner's stock They are put on a par with animals This same master shot a woman through the head who had run away and been brought back to him No one called him to account for it If a slave resisted being whipped the bloodhounds were unpacked and set upon him to tear his flesh from his bones The master who did these things was highly educated and styled a perfect gentleman He also boasted the name and standing of a Christian though Satan never had a truer follower I could tell of more slaveholders as cruel as those I have described They are not exceptions to the general rule I do not say there are no humane slaveholders Such characters do exist notwithstanding the hardening influences around them But they are like angels' visitsfew and far between I knew a young lady who was one of these rare specimens She was an orphan and inherited as slaves a woman and her six children Their father was a free man They had a comfortable home of their own parents and children living together The mother and eldest daughter served their mistress during the day and at night returned to their dwelling which was on the premises The young lady was very pious and there was some reality in her religion She taught her slaves to lead pure lives and wished them to enjoy the fruit of their own industry Her religion was not a garb put on for Sunday and laid aside till Sunday returned again The eldest daughter of the slave mother was promised in marriage to a free man and the day before the wedding this good mistress emancipated her in order that her marriage might have the sanction of law Report said that this young lady cherished an unrequited affection for a man who had resolved to marry for wealth In the course of time a rich uncle of hers died He left six thousand dollars to his two sons by a colored woman and the remainder of his property to this orphan niece The metal soon attracted the magnet The lady and her weighty purse became his She offered to manumit her slavestelling them that her marriage might make unexpected changes in their destiny and she wished to insure their happiness They refused to take their freedom saying that she had always been their best friend and they could not be so happy any where as with her I was not surprised I had often seen them in their comfortable home and thought that the whole town did not contain a happier family They had never felt slavery and when it was too late they were convinced of its reality When the new master claimed this family as his property the father became furious and went to his mistress for protection I can do nothing for you now Harry said she I no longer have the power I had a week ago I have succeeded in obtaining the freedom of your wife but I cannot obtain it for your children The unhappy father swore that nobody should take his children from him He concealed them in the woods for some days but they were discovered and taken The father was put in jail and the two oldest boys sold to Georgia One little girl too young to be of service to her master was left with the wretched mother The other three were carried to their master's plantation The eldest soon became a mother and when the slaveholder's wife looked at the babe she wept bitterly She knew that her own husband had violated the purity she had so carefully inculcated She had a second child by her master and then he sold her and his offspring to his brother She bore two children to the brother and was sold again The next sister went crazy The life she was compelled to lead drove her mad The third one became the mother of five daughters Before the birth of the fourth the pious mistress died To the last she rendered every kindness to the slaves that her unfortunate circumstances permitted She passed away peacefully glad to close her eyes on a life which had been made so wretched by the man she loved This man squandered the fortune he had received and sought to retrieve his affairs by a second marriage but having retired after a night of drunken debauch he was found dead in the morning He was called a good master for he fed and clothed his slaves better than most masters and the lash was not heard on his plantation so frequently as on many others Had it not been for slavery he would have been a better man and his wife a happier woman No pen can give an adequate description of the all-pervading corruption produced by slavery The slave girl is reared in an atmosphere of licentiousness and fear The lash and the foul talk of her master and his sons are her teachers When she is fourteen or fifteen her owner or his sons or the overseer or perhaps all of them begin to bribe her with presents If these fail to accomplish their purpose she is whipped or starved into submission to their will She may have had religious principles inculcated by some pious mother or grandmother or some good mistress she may have a lover whose good opinion and peace of mind are dear to her heart or the profligate men who have power over her may be exceedingly odious to her But resistance is hopeless The poor worm Shall prove her contest vain Life's little day Shall pass and she is gone The slaveholder's sons are of course vitiated even while boys by the unclean influences every where around them Nor do the master's daughters always escape Severe retributions sometimes come upon him for the wrongs he does to the daughters of the slaves The white daughters early hear their parents quarrelling about some female slave Their curiosity is excited and they soon learn the cause They are attended by the young slave girls whom their father has corrupted and they hear such talk as should never meet youthful ears or any other ears They know that the women slaves are subject to their father's authority in all things and in some cases they exercise the same authority over the men slaves I have myself seen the master of such a household whose head was bowed down in shame for it was known in the neighborhood that his daughter had selected one of the meanest slaves on his plantation to be the father of his first grandchild She did not make her advances to her equals nor even to her father's more intelligent servants She selected the most brutalized over whom her authority could be exercised with less fear of exposure Her father half frantic with rage sought to revenge himself on the offending black man but his daughter foreseeing the storm that would arise had given him free papers and sent him out of the state In such cases the infant is smothered or sent where it is never seen by any who know its history But if the white parent is the father instead of the mother the offspring are unblushingly reared for the market If they are girls I have indicated plainly enough what will be their inevitable destiny You may believe what I say for I write only that whereof I know I was twenty-one years in that cage of obscene birds I can testify from my own experience and observation that slavery is a curse to the whites as well as to the blacks It makes the white fathers cruel and sensual the sons violent and licentious it contaminates the daughters and makes the wives wretched And as for the colored race it needs an abler pen than mine to describe the extremity of their sufferings the depth of their degradation Yet few slaveholders seem to be aware of the widespread moral ruin occasioned by this wicked system Their talk is of blighted cotton cropsnot of the blight on their children's souls If you want to be fully convinced of the abominations of slavery go on a southern plantation and call yourself a negro trader Then there will be no concealment and you will see and hear things that will seem to you impossible among human beings with immortal souls X A PERILOUS PASSAGE IN THE SLAVE GIRL'S LIFE AFTER my lover went away Dr Flint contrived a new plan He seemed to have an idea that my fear of my mistress was his greatest obstacle In the blandest tones he told me that he was going to build a small house for me in a secluded place four miles away from the town I shuddered but I was constrained to listen while he talked of his intention to give me a home of my own and to make a lady of me Hitherto I had escaped my dreaded fate by being in the midst of people My grandmother had already had high words with my master about me She had told him pretty plainly what she thought of his character and there was considerable gossip in the neighborhood about our affairs to which the open-mouthed jealousy of Mrs Flint contributed not a little When my master said he was going to build a house for me and that he could do it with little trouble and expense I was in hopes something would happen to frustrate his scheme but I soon heard that the house was actually begun I vowed before my Maker that I would never enter it I had rather toil on the plantation from dawn till dark I had rather live and die in jail than drag on from day to day through such a living death I was determined that the master whom I so hated and loathed who had blighted the prospects of my youth and made my life a desert should not after my long struggle with him succeed at last in trampling his victim under his feet I would do any thing every thing for the sake of defeating him What could I do I thought and thought till I became desperate and made a plunge into the abyss And now reader I come to a period in my unhappy life which I would gladly forget if I could The remembrance fills me with sorrow and shame It pains me to tell you of it but I have promised to tell you the truth and I will do it honestly let it cost me what it may I will not try to screen myself behind the plea of compulsion from a master for it was not so Neither can I plead ignorance or thoughtlessness For years my master had done his utmost to pollute my mind with foul images and to destroy the pure principles inculcated by my grandmother and the good mistress of my childhood The influences of slavery had had the same effect on me that they had on other young girls they had made me prematurely knowing concerning the evil ways of the world I know what I did and I did it with deliberate calculation But O ye happy women whose purity has been sheltered from childhood who have been free to choose the objects of your affection whose homes are protected by law do not judge the poor desolate slave girl too severely If slavery had been abolished I also could have married the man of my choice I could have had a home shielded by the laws and I should have been spared the painful task of confessing what I am now about to relate but all my prospects had been blighted by slavery I wanted to keep myself pure and under the most adverse circumstances I tried hard to preserve my self-respect but I was struggling alone in the powerful grasp of the demon Slavery and the monster proved too strong for me I felt as if I was forsaken by God and man as if all my efforts must be frustrated and I became reckless in my despair I have told you that Dr Flint's persecutions and his wife's jealousy had given rise to some gossip in the neighborhood Among others it chanced that a white unmarried gentleman had obtained some knowledge of the circumstances in which I was placed He knew my grandmother and often spoke to me in the street He became interested for me and asked questions about my master which I answered in part He expressed a great deal of sympathy and a wish to aid me He constantly sought opportunities to see me and wrote to me frequently I was a poor slave girl only fifteen years old So much attention from a superior person was of course flattering for human nature is the same in all I also felt grateful for his sympathy and encouraged by his kind words It seemed to me a great thing to have such a friend By degrees a more tender feeling crept into my heart He was an educated and eloquent gentleman too eloquent alas for the poor slave girl who trusted in him Of course I saw whither all this was tending I knew the impassable gulf between us but to be an object of interest to a man who is not married and who is not her master is agreeable to the pride and feelings of a slave if her miserable situation has left her any pride or sentiment It seems less degrading to give one's self than to submit to compulsion There is something akin to freedom in having a lover who has no control over you except that which he gains by kindness and attachment A master may treat you as rudely as he pleases and you dare not speak moreover the wrong does not seem so great with an unmarried man as with one who has a wife to be made unhappy There may be sophistry in all this but the condition of a slave confuses all principles of morality and in fact renders the practice of them impossible When I found that my master had actually begun to build the lonely cottage other feelings mixed with those I have described Revenge and calculations of interest were added to flattered vanity and sincere gratitude for kindness I knew nothing would enrage Dr Flint so much as to know that I favored another and it was something to triumph over my tyrant even in that small way I thought he would revenge himself by selling me and I was sure my friend Mr Sands would buy me He was a man of more generosity and feeling than my master and I thought my freedom could be easily obtained from him The crisis of my fate now came so near that I was desperate I shuddered to think of being the mother of children that should be owned by my old tyrant I knew that as soon as a new fancy took him his victims were sold far off to get rid of them especially if they had children I had seen several women sold with his babies at the breast He never allowed his offspring by slaves to remain long in sight of himself and his wife Of a man who was not my master I could ask to have my children well supported and in this case I felt confident I should obtain the boon I also felt quite sure that they would be made free With all these thoughts revolving in my mind and seeing no other way of escaping the doom I so much dreaded I made a headlong plunge Pity me and pardon me O virtuous reader You never knew what it is to be a slave to be entirely unprotected by law or custom to have the laws reduce you to the condition of a chattel entirely subject to the will of another You never exhausted your ingenuity in avoiding the snares and eluding the power of a hated tyrant you never shuddered at the sound of his footsteps and trembled within hearing of his voice I know I did wrong No one can feel it more sensibly than I do The painful and humiliating memory will haunt me to my dying day Still in looking back calmly on the events of my life I feel that the slave woman ought not to be judged by the same standard as others The months passed on I had many unhappy hours I secretly mourned over the sorrow I was bringing on my grandmother who had so tried to shield me from harm I knew that I was the greatest comfort of her old age and that it was a source of pride to her that I had not degraded myself like most of the slaves I wanted to confess to her that I was no longer worthy of her love but I could not utter the dreaded words As for Dr Flint I had a feeling of satisfaction and triumph in the thought of telling him From time to time he told me of his intended arrangements and I was silent At last he came and told me the cottage was completed and ordered me to go to it I told him I would never enter it He said I have heard enough of such talk as that You shall go if you are carried by force and you shall remain there I replied I will never go there In a few months I shall be a mother He stood and looked at me in dumb amazement and left the house without a word I thought I should be happy in my triumph over him But now that the truth was out and my relatives would hear of it I felt wretched Humble as were their circumstances they had pride in my good character Now how could I look them in the face My self-respect was gone I had resolved that I would be virtuous though I was a slave I had said Let the storm beat I will brave it till I die And now how humiliated I felt I went to my grandmother My lips moved to make confession but the words stuck in my throat I sat down in the shade of a tree at her door and began to sew I think she saw something unusual was the matter with me The mother of slaves is very watchful She knows there is no security for her children After they have entered their teens she lives in daily expectation of trouble This leads to many questions If the girl is of a sensitive nature timidity keeps her from answering truthfully and this well-meant course has a tendency to drive her from maternal counsels Presently in came my mistress like a mad woman and accused me concerning her husband My grandmother whose suspicions had been previously awakened believed what she said She exclaimed O Linda has it come to this I had rather see you dead than to see you as you now are You are a disgrace to your dead mother She tore from my fingers my mother's wedding ring and her silver thimble Go away she exclaimed and never come to my house again Her reproaches fell so hot and heavy that they left me no chance to answer Bitter tears such as the eyes never shed but once were my only answer I rose from my seat but fell back again sobbing She did not speak to me but the tears were running down her furrowed cheeks and they scorched me like fire She had always been so kind to me So kind How I longed to throw myself at her feet and tell her all the truth But she had ordered me to go and never to come there again After a few minutes I mustered strength and started to obey her With what feelings did I now close that little gate which I used to open with such an eager hand in my childhood It closed upon me with a sound I never heard before Where could I go I was afraid to return to my master's I walked on recklessly not caring where I went or what would become of me When I had gone four or five miles fatigue compelled me to stop I sat down on the stump of an old tree The stars were shining through the boughs above me How they mocked me with their bright calm light The hours passed by and as I sat there alone a chilliness and deadly sickness came over me I sank on the ground My mind was full of horrid thoughts I prayed to die but the prayer was not answered At last with great effort I roused myself and walked some distance further to the house of a woman who had been a friend of my mother When I told her why I was there she spoke soothingly to me but I could not be comforted I thought I could bear my shame if I could only be reconciled to my grandmother I longed to open my heart to her I thought if she could know the real state of the case and all I had been bearing for years she would perhaps judge me less harshly My friend advised me to send for her I did so but days of agonizing suspense passed before she came Had she utterly forsaken me No She came at last I knelt before her and told her the things that had poisoned my life how long I had been persecuted that I saw no way of escape and in an hour of extremity I had become desperate She listened in silence I told her I would bear any thing and do any thing if in time I had hopes of obtaining her forgiveness I begged of her to pity me for my dead mother's sake And she did pity me She did not say I forgive you but she looked at me lovingly with her eyes full of tears She laid her old hand gently on my head and murmured Poor child Poor child XI THE NEW TIE TO LIFE I RETURNED to my good grandmother's house She had an interview with Mr Sands When she asked him why he could not have left her one ewe lambwhether there were not plenty of slaves who did not care about characterhe made no answer but he spoke kind and encouraging words He promised to care for my child and to buy me be the conditions what they might I had not seen Dr Flint for five days I had never seen him since I made the avowal to him He talked of the disgrace I had brought on myself how I had sinned against my master and mortified my old grandmother He intimated that if I had accepted his proposals he as a physician could have saved me from exposure He even condescended to pity me Could he have offered wormwood more bitter He whose persecutions had been the cause of my sin Linda said he though you have been criminal towards me I feel for you and I can pardon you if you obey my wishes Tell me whether the fellow you wanted to marry is the father of your child If you deceive me you shall feel the fires of hell I did not feel as proud as I had done My strongest weapon with him was gone I was lowered in my own estimation and had resolved to bear his abuse in silence But when he spoke contemptuously of the lover who had always treated me honorably when I remembered that but for him I might have been a virtuous free and happy wife I lost my patience I have sinned against God and myself I replied but not against you He clinched his teeth and muttered Curse you He came towards me with ill-suppressed rage and exclaimed You obstinate girl I could grind your bones to powder You have thrown yourself away on some worthless rascal You are weak-minded and have been easily persuaded by those who don't care a straw for you The future will settle accounts between us You are blinded now but hereafter you will be convinced that your master was your best friend My lenity towards you is a proof of it I might have punished you in many ways I might have had you whipped till you fell dead under the lash But I wanted you to live I would have bettered your condition Others cannot do it You are my slave Your mistress disgusted by your conduct forbids you to return to the house therefore I leave you here for the present but I shall see you often I will call tomorrow He came with frowning brows that showed a dissatisfied state of mind After asking about my health he inquired whether my board was paid and who visited me He then went on to say that he had neglected his duty that as a physician there were certain things that he ought to have explained to me Then followed talk such as would have made the most shameless blush He ordered me to stand up before him I obeyed I command you said he to tell me whether the father of your child is white or black I hesitated Answer me this instant he exclaimed I did answer He sprang upon me like a wolf and grabbed my arm as if he would have broken it Do you love him said he in a hissing tone I am thankful that I do not despise him I replied He raised his hand to strike me but it fell again I don't know what arrested the blow He sat down with lips tightly compressed At last he spoke I came here said he to make you a friendly proposition but your ingratitude chafes me beyond endurance You turn aside all my good intentions towards you I don't know what it is that keeps me from killing you Again he rose as if he had a mind to strike me But he resumed On one condition I will forgive your insolence and crime You must henceforth have no communication of any kind with the father of your child You must not ask any thing from him or receive any thing from him I will take care of you and your child You had better promise this at once and not wait till you are deserted by him This is the last act of mercy I shall show towards you I said something about being unwilling to have my child supported by a man who had cursed it and me also He rejoined that a woman who had sunk to my level had no right to expect any thing else He asked for the last time would I accept his kindness I answered that I would not Very well said he then take the consequences of your wayward course Never look to me for help You are my slave and shall always be my slave I will never sell you that you may depend upon Hope died away in my heart as he closed the door after him I had calculated that in his rage he would sell me to a slave-trader and I knew the father of my child was on the watch to buy me About this time my uncle Phillip was expected to return from a voyage The day before his departure I had officiated as bridesmaid to a young friend My heart was then ill at ease but my smiling countenance did not betray it Only a year had passed but what fearful changes it had wrought My heart had grown gray in misery Lives that flash in sunshine and lives that are born in tears receive their hue from circumstances None of us know what a year may bring forth I felt no joy when they told me my uncle had come He wanted to see me though he knew what had happened I shrank from him at first but at last consented that he should come to my room He received me as he always had done O how my heart smote me when I felt his tears on my burning cheeks The words of my grandmother came to my mindPerhaps your mother and father are taken from the evil days to come My disappointed heart could now praise God that it was so But why thought I did my relatives ever cherish hopes for me What was there to save me from the usual fate of slave girls Many more beautiful and more intelligent than I had experienced a similar fate or a far worse one How could they hope that I should escape My uncle's stay was short and I was not sorry for it I was too ill in mind and body to enjoy my friends as I had done For some weeks I was unable to leave my bed I could not have any doctor but my master and I would not have him sent for At last alarmed by my increasing illness they sent for him I was very weak and nervous and as soon as he entered the room I began to scream They told him my state was very critical He had no wish to hasten me out of the world and he withdrew When my babe was born they said it was premature It weighed only four pounds but God let it live I heard the doctor say I could not survive till morning I had often prayed for death but now I did not want to die unless my child could die too Many weeks passed before I was able to leave my bed I was a mere wreck of my former self For a year there was scarcely a day when I was free from chills and fever My babe also was sickly His little limbs were often racked with pain Dr Flint continued his visits to look after my health and he did not fail to remind me that my child was an addition to his stock of slaves I felt too feeble to dispute with him and listened to his remarks in silence His visits were less frequent but his busy spirit could not remain quiet He employed my brother in his office and he was made the medium of frequent notes and messages to me William was a bright lad and of much use to the doctor He had learned to put up medicines to leech cup and bleed He had taught himself to read and spell I was proud of my brother and the old doctor suspected as much One day when I had not seen him for several weeks I heard his steps approaching the door I dreaded the encounter and hid myself He inquired for me of course but I was nowhere to be found He went to his office and despatched William with a note The color mounted to my brother's face when he gave it to me and he said Don't you hate me Linda for bringing you these things I told him I could not blame him he was a slave and obliged to obey his master's will The note ordered me to come to his office I went He demanded to know where I was when he called I told him I was at home He flew into a passion and said he knew better Then he launched out upon his usual themesmy crimes against him and my ingratitude for his forbearance The laws were laid down to me anew and I was dismissed I felt humiliated that my brother should stand by and listen to such language as would be addressed only to a slave Poor boy He was powerless to defend me but I saw the tears which he vainly strove to keep back This manifestation of feeling irritated the doctor William could do nothing to please him One morning he did not arrive at the office so early as usual and that circumstance afforded his master an opportunity to vent his spleen He was put in jail The next day my brother sent a trader to the doctor with a request to be sold His master was greatly incensed at what he called his insolence He said he had put him there to reflect upon his bad conduct and he certainly was not giving any evidence of repentance For two days he harassed himself to find somebody to do his office work but every thing went wrong without William He was released and ordered to take his old stand with many threats if he was not careful about his future behavior As the months passed on my boy improved in health When he was a year old they called him beautiful The little vine was taking deep root in my existence though its clinging fondness excited a mixture of love and pain When I was most sorely oppressed I found a solace in his smiles I loved to watch his infant slumbers but always there was a dark cloud over my enjoyment I could never forget that he was a slave Sometimes I wished that he might die in infancy God tried me My darling became very ill The bright eyes grew dull and the little feet and hands were so icy cold that I thought death had already touched them I had prayed for his death but never so earnestly as I now prayed for his life and my prayer was heard Alas what mockery it is for a slave mother to try to pray back her dying child to life Death is better than slavery It was a sad thought that I had no name to give my child His father caressed him and treated him kindly whenever he had a chance to see him He was not unwilling that he should bear his name but he had no legal claim to it and if I had bestowed it upon him my master would have regarded it as a new crime a new piece of insolence and would perhaps revenge it on the boy O the serpent of Slavery has many and poisonous fangs XII FEAR OF INSURRECTION NOT far from this time Nat Turner's insurrection broke out and the news threw our town into great commotion Strange that they should be alarmed when their slaves were so contented and happy But so it was It was always the custom to have a muster every year On that occasion every white man shouldered his musket The citizens and the so-called country gentlemen wore military uniforms The poor whites took their places in the ranks in every-day dress some without shoes some without hats This grand occasion had already passed and when the slaves were told there was to be another muster they were surprised and rejoiced Poor creatures They thought it was going to be a holiday I was informed of the true state of affairs and imparted it to the few I could trust Most gladly would I have proclaimed it to every slave but I dared not All could not be relied on Mighty is the power of the torturing lash By sunrise people were pouring in from every quarter within twenty miles of the town I knew the houses were to be searched and I expected it would be done by country bullies and the poor whites I knew nothing annoyed them so much as to see colored people living in comfort and respectability so I made arrangements for them with especial care I arranged every thing in my grandmother's house as neatly as possible I put white quilts on the beds and decorated some of the rooms with flowers When all was arranged I sat down at the window to watch Far as my eye could reach it rested on a motley crowd of soldiers Drums and fifes were discoursing martial music The men were divided into companies of sixteen each headed by a captain Orders were given and the wild scouts rushed in every direction wherever a colored face was to be found It was a grand opportunity for the low whites who had no negroes of their own to scourge They exulted in such a chance to exercise a little brief authority and show their subserviency to the slaveholders not reflecting that the power which trampled on the colored people also kept themselves in poverty ignorance and moral degradation Those who never witnessed such scenes can hardly believe what I know was inflicted at this time on innocent men women and children against whom there was not the slightest ground for suspicion Colored people and slaves who lived in remote parts of the town suffered in an especial manner In some cases the searchers scattered powder and shot among their clothes and then sent other parties to find them and bring them forward as proof that they were plotting insurrection Every where men women and children were whipped till the blood stood in puddles at their feet Some received five hundred lashes others were tied hands and feet and tortured with a bucking paddle which blisters the skin terribly The dwellings of the colored people unless they happened to be protected by some influential white person who was nigh at hand were robbed of clothing and every thing else the marauders thought worth carrying away All day long these unfeeling wretches went round like a troop of demons terrifying and tormenting the helpless At night they formed themselves into patrol bands and went wherever they chose among the colored people acting out their brutal will Many women hid themselves in woods and swamps to keep out of their way If any of the husbands or fathers told of these outrages they were tied up to the public whipping post and cruelly scourged for telling lies about white men The consternation was universal No two people that had the slightest tinge of color in their faces dared to be seen talking together I entertained no positive fears about our household because we were in the midst of white families who would protect us We were ready to receive the soldiers whenever they came It was not long before we heard the tramp of feet and the sound of voices The door was rudely pushed open and in they tumbled like a pack of hungry wolves They snatched at every thing within their reach Every box trunk closet and corner underwent a thorough examination A box in one of the drawers containing some silver change was eagerly pounced upon When I stepped forward to take it from them one of the soldiers turned and said angrily What d'ye foller us fur D'ye s'pose white folks is come to steal I replied You have come to search but you have searched that box and I will take it if you please At that moment I saw a white gentleman who was friendly to us and I called to him and asked him to have the goodness to come in and stay till the search was over He readily complied His entrance into the house brought in the captain of the company whose business it was to guard the outside of the house and see that none of the inmates left it This officer was Mr Litch the wealthy slaveholder whom I mentioned in the account of neighboring planters as being notorious for his cruelty He felt above soiling his hands with the search He merely gave orders and if a bit of writing was discovered it was carried to him by his ignorant followers who were unable to read My grandmother had a large trunk of bedding and table cloths When that was opened there was a great shout of surprise and one exclaimed Where'd the damned niggers git all dis sheet an' table clarf My grandmother emboldened by the presence of our white protector said You may be sure we didn't pilfer 'em from your houses Look here mammy said a grim-looking fellow without any coat you seem to feel mighty gran' 'cause you got all them 'ere fixens White folks oughter have 'em all His remarks were interrupted by a chorus of voices shouting We's got 'em We's got 'em Dis 'ere yaller gal's got letters There was a general rush for the supposed letter which upon examination proved to be some verses written to me by a friend In packing away my things I had overlooked them When their captain informed them of their contents they seemed much disappointed He inquired of me who wrote them I told him it was one of my friends Can you read them he asked When I told him I could he swore and raved and tore the paper into bits Bring me all your letters said he in a commanding tone I told him I had none Don't be afraid he continued in an insinuating way Bring them all to me Nobody shall do you any harm Seeing I did not move to obey him his pleasant tone changed to oaths and threats Who writes to you half free niggers inquired he I replied O no most of my letters are from white people Some request me to burn them after they are read and some I destroy without reading An exclamation of surprise from some of the company put a stop to our conversation Some silver spoons which ornamented an old-fashioned buffet had just been discovered My grandmother was in the habit of preserving fruit for many ladies in the town and of preparing suppers for parties consequently she had many jars of preserves The closet that contained these was next invaded and the contents tasted One of them who was helping himself freely tapped his neighbor on the shoulder and said Wal done Don't wonder de niggers want to kill all de white folks when dey live on 'sarves meaning preserves I stretched out my hand to take the jar saying You were not sent here to search for sweetmeats And what were we sent for said the captain bristling up to me I evaded the question The search of the house was completed and nothing found to condemn us They next proceeded to the garden and knocked about every bush and vine with no better success The captain called his men together and after a short consultation the order to march was given As they passed out of the gate the captain turned back and pronounced a malediction on the house He said it ought to be burned to the ground and each of its inmates receive thirty-nine lashes We came out of this affair very fortunately not losing any thing except some wearing apparel Towards evening the turbulence increased The soldiers stimulated by drink committed still greater cruelties Shrieks and shouts continually rent the air Not daring to go to the door I peeped under the window curtain I saw a mob dragging along a number of colored people each white man with his musket upraised threatening instant death if they did not stop their shrieks Among the prisoners was a respectable old colored minister They had found a few parcels of shot in his house which his wife had for years used to balance her scales For this they were going to shoot him on Court House Green What a spectacle was that for a civilized country A rabble staggering under intoxication assuming to be the administrators of justice The better class of the community exerted their influence to save the innocent persecuted people and in several instances they succeeded by keeping them shut up in jail till the excitement abated At last the white citizens found that their own property was not safe from the lawless rabble they had summoned to protect them They rallied the drunken swarm drove them back into the country and set a guard over the town The next day the town patrols were commissioned to search colored people that lived out of the city and the most shocking outrages were committed with perfect impunity Every day for a fortnight if I looked out I saw horsemen with some poor panting negro tied to their saddles and compelled by the lash to keep up with their speed till they arrived at the jail yard Those who had been whipped too unmercifully to walk were washed with brine tossed into a cart and carried to jail One black man who had not fortitude to endure scourging promised to give information about the conspiracy But it turned out that he knew nothing at all He had not even heard the name of Nat Turner The poor fellow had however made up a story which augmented his own sufferings and those of the colored people The day patrol continued for some weeks and at sundown a night guard was substituted Nothing at all was proved against the colored people bond or free The wrath of the slaveholders was somewhat appeased by the capture of Nat Turner The imprisoned were released The slaves were sent to their masters and the free were permitted to return to their ravaged homes Visiting was strictly forbidden on the plantations The slaves begged the privilege of again meeting at their little church in the woods with their burying ground around it It was built by the colored people and they had no higher happiness than to meet there and sing hymns together and pour out their hearts in spontaneous prayer Their request was denied and the church was demolished They were permitted to attend the white churches a certain portion of the galleries being appropriated to their use There when every body else had partaken of the communion and the benediction had been pronounced the minister said Come down now my colored friends They obeyed the summons and partook of the bread and wine in commemoration of the meek and lowly Jesus who said God is your Father and all ye are brethren XIII THE CHURCH AND SLAVERY AFTER the alarm caused by Nat Turner's insurrection had subsided the slaveholders came to the conclusion that it would be well to give the slaves enough of religious instruction to keep them from murdering their masters The Episcopal clergyman offered to hold a separate service on Sundays for their benefit His colored members were very few and also very respectablea fact which I presume had some weight with him The difficulty was to decide on a suitable place for them to worship The Methodist and Baptist churches admitted them in the afternoon but their carpets and cushions were not so costly as those at the Episcopal church It was at last decided that they should meet at the house of a free colored man who was a member I was invited to attend because I could read Sunday evening came and trusting to the cover of night I ventured out I rarely ventured out by daylight for I always went with fear expecting at every turn to encounter Dr Flint who was sure to turn me back or order me to his office to inquire where I got my bonnet or some other article of dress When the Rev Mr Pike came there were some twenty persons present The reverend gentleman knelt in prayer then seated himself and requested all present who could read to open their books while he gave out the portions he wished them to repeat or respond to His text was Servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto Christ Pious Mr Pike brushed up his hair till it stood upright and in deep solemn tones began Hearken ye servants Give strict heed unto my words You are rebellious sinners Your hearts are filled with all manner of evil 'Tis the devil who tempts you God is angry with you and will surely punish you if you don't forsake your wicked ways You that live in town are eye-servants behind your master's back Instead of serving your masters faithfully which is pleasing in the sight of your heavenly Master you are idle and shirk your work God sees you You tell lies God hears you Instead of being engaged in worshipping him you are hidden away somewhere feasting on your master's substance tossing coffee-grounds with some wicked fortuneteller or cutting cards with another old hag Your masters may not find you out but God sees you and will punish you O the depravity of your hearts When your master's work is done are you quietly together thinking of the goodness of God to such sinful creatures No you are quarrelling and tying up little bags of roots to bury under the door-steps to poison each other with God sees you You men steal away to every grog shop to sell your master's corn that you may buy rum to drink God sees you You sneak into the back streets or among the bushes to pitch coppers Although your masters may not find you out God sees you and he will punish you You must forsake your sinful ways and be faithful servants Obey your old master and your young masteryour old mistress and your young mistress If you disobey your earthly master you offend your heavenly Master You must obey God's commandments When you go from here don't stop at the corners of the streets to talk but go directly home and let your master and mistress see that you have come The benediction was pronounced We went home highly amused at brother Pike's gospel teaching and we determined to hear him again I went the next Sabbath evening and heard pretty much a repetition of the last discourse At the close of the meeting Mr Pike informed us that he found it very inconvenient to meet at the friend's house and he should be glad to see us every Sunday evening at his own kitchen I went home with the feeling that I had heard the Reverend Mr Pike for the last time Some of his members repaired to his house and found that the kitchen sported two tallow candles the first time I am sure since its present occupant owned it for the servants never had any thing but pine knots It was so long before the reverend gentleman descended from his comfortable parlor that the slaves left and went to enjoy a Methodist shout They never seem so happy as when shouting and singing at religious meetings Many of them are sincere and nearer to the gate of heaven than sanctimonious Mr Pike and other long-faced Christians who see wounded Samaritans and pass by on the other side The slaves generally compose their own songs and hymns and they do not trouble their heads much about the measure They often sing the following verses Old Satan is one busy ole man He rolls dem blocks all in my way But Jesus is my bosom friend He rolls dem blocks away If I had died when I was young Den how my stam'ring tongue would have sung But I am ole and now I stand A narrow chance for to tread dat heavenly land I well remember one occasion when I attended a Methodist class meeting I went with a burdened spirit and happened to sit next a poor bereaved mother whose heart was still heavier than mine The class leader was the town constablea man who bought and sold slaves who whipped his brethren and sisters of the church at the public whipping post in jail or out of jail He was ready to perform that Christian office any where for fifty cents This white-faced black-hearted brother came near us and said to the stricken woman Sister can't you tell us how the Lord deals with your soul Do you love him as you did formerly She rose to her feet and said in piteous tones My Lord and Master help me My load is more than I can bear God has hid himself from me and I am left in darkness and misery Then striking her breast she continued I can't tell you what is in here They've got all my children Last week they took the last one God only knows where they've sold her They let me have her sixteen years and thenO O Pray for her brothers and sisters I've got nothing to live for now God make my time short She sat down quivering in every limb I saw that constable class leader become crimson in the face with suppressed laughter while he held up his handkerchief that those who were weeping for the poor woman's calamity might not see his merriment Then with assumed gravity he said to the bereaved mother Sister pray to the Lord that every dispensation of his divine will may be sanctified to the good of your poor needy soul The congregation struck up a hymn and sung as though they were as free as the birds that warbled round us Ole Satan thought he had a mighty aim He missed my soul and caught my sins Cry Amen cry Amen cry Amen to God He took my sins upon his back Went muttering and grumbling down to hell Cry Amen cry Amen cry Amen to God Ole Satan's church is here below Up to God's free church I hope to go Cry Amen cry Amen cry Amen to God Precious are such moments to the poor slaves If you were to hear them at such times you might think they were happy But can that hour of singing and shouting sustain them through the dreary week toiling without wages under constant dread of the lash The Episcopal clergyman who ever since my earliest recollection had been a sort of god among the slaveholders concluded as his family was large that he must go where money was more abundant A very different clergyman took his place The change was very agreeable to the colored people who said God has sent us a good man this time They loved him and their children followed him for a smile or a kind word Even the slaveholders felt his influence He brought to the rectory five slaves His wife taught them to read and write and to be useful to her and themselves As soon as he was settled he turned his attention to the needy slaves around him He urged upon his parishioners the duty of having a meeting expressly for them every Sunday with a sermon adapted to their comprehension After much argument and importunity it was finally agreed that they might occupy the gallery of the church on Sunday evenings Many colored people hitherto unaccustomed to attend church now gladly went to hear the gospel preached The sermons were simple and they understood them Moreover it was the first time they had ever been addressed as human beings It was not long before his white parishioners began to be dissatisfied He was accused of preaching better sermons to the negroes than he did to them He honestly confessed that he bestowed more pains upon those sermons than upon any others for the slaves were reared in such ignorance that it was a difficult task to adapt himself to their comprehension Dissensions arose in the parish Some wanted he should preach to them in the evening and to the slaves in the afternoon In the midst of these disputings his wife died after a very short illness Her slaves gathered round her dying bed in great sorrow She said I have tried to do you good and promote your happiness and if I have failed it has not been for want of interest in your welfare Do not weep for me but prepare for the new duties that lie before you I leave you all free May we meet in a better world Her liberated slaves were sent away with funds to establish them comfortably The colored people will long bless the memory of that truly Christian woman Soon after her death her husband preached his farewell sermon and many tears were shed at his departure Several years after he passed through our town and preached to his former congregation In his afternoon sermon he addressed the colored people My friends said he it affords me great happiness to have an opportunity of speaking to you again For two years I have been striving to do something for the colored people of my own parish but nothing is yet accomplished I have not even preached a sermon to them Try to live according to the word of God my friends Your skin is darker than mine but God judges men by their hearts not by the color of their skins This was strange doctrine from a southern pulpit It was very offensive to slaveholders They said he and his wife had made fools of their slaves and that he preached like a fool to the negroes I knew an old black man whose piety and childlike trust in God were beautiful to witness At fifty-three years old he joined the Baptist church He had a most earnest desire to learn to read He thought he should know how to serve God better if he could only read the Bible He came to me and begged me to teach him He said he could not pay me for he had no money but he would bring me nice fruit when the season for it came I asked him if he didn't know it was contrary to law and that slaves were whipped and imprisoned for teaching each other to read This brought the tears into his eyes Don't be troubled uncle Fred said I I have no thoughts of refusing to teach you I only told you of the law that you might know the danger and be on your guard He thought he could plan to come three times a week without its being suspected I selected a quiet nook where no intruder was likely to penetrate and there I taught him his A B and C Considering his age his progress was astonishing As soon as he could spell in two syllables he wanted to spell out words in the Bible The happy smile that illuminated his face put joy into my heart After spelling out a few words he paused and said Honey it 'pears when I can read dis good book I shall be nearer to God White man is got all de sense He can larn easy It ain't easy for ole black man like me I only wants to read dis book dat I may know how to live den I hab no fear 'bout dying I tried to encourage him by speaking of the rapid progress he had made Hab patience child he replied I larns slow I had no need of patience His gratitude and the happiness I imparted were more than a recompense for all my trouble At the end of six months he had read through the New Testament and could find any text in it One day when he had recited unusually well I said Uncle Fred how do you manage to get your lessons so well Lord bress you chile he replied You nebber gibs me a lesson dat I don't pray to God to help me to understan' what I spells and what I reads And he does help me chile Bress his holy name There are thousands who like good uncle Fred are thirsting for the water of life but the law forbids it and the churches withhold it They send the Bible to heathen abroad and neglect the heathen at home I am glad that missionaries go out to the dark corners of the earth but I ask them not to overlook the dark corners at home Talk to American slaveholders as you talk to savages in Africa Tell them it is wrong to traffic in men Tell them it is sinful to sell their own children and atrocious to violate their own daughters Tell them that all men are brethren and that man has no right to shut out the light of knowledge from his brother Tell them they are answerable to God for sealing up the Fountain of Life from souls that are thirsting for it There are men who would gladly undertake such missionary work as this but alas their number is small They are hated by the south and would be driven from its soil or dragged to prison to die as others have been before them The field is ripe for the harvest and awaits the reapers Perhaps the great grandchildren of uncle Fred may have freely imparted to them the divine treasures which he sought by stealth at the risk of the prison and the scourge Are doctors of divinity blind or are they hypocrites I suppose some are the one and some the other but I think if they felt the interest in the poor and the lowly that they ought to feel they would not be so easily blinded A clergyman who goes to the south for the first time has usually some feeling however vague that slavery is wrong The slaveholder suspects this and plays his game accordingly He makes himself as agreeable as possible talks on theology and other kindred topics The reverend gentleman is asked to invoke a blessing on a table loaded with luxuries After dinner he walks round the premises and sees the beautiful groves and flowering vines and the comfortable huts of favored household slaves The southerner invites him to talk with these slaves He asks them if they want to be free and they say O no massa This is sufficient to satisfy him He comes home to publish a South-Side View of Slavery and to complain of the exaggerations of abolitionists He assures people that he has been to the south and seen slavery for himself that it is a beautiful patriarchal institution that the slaves don't want their freedom that they have hallelujah meetings and other religious privileges What does he know of the half-starved wretches toiling from dawn till dark on the plantations of mothers shrieking for their children torn from their arms by slave traders of young girls dragged down into moral filth of pools of blood around the whipping post of hounds trained to tear human flesh of men screwed into cotton gins to die The slaveholder showed him none of these things and the slaves dared not tell of them if he had asked them There is a great difference between Christianity and religion at the south If a man goes to the communion table and pays money into the treasury of the church no matter if it be the price of blood he is called religious If a pastor has offspring by a woman not his wife the church dismiss him if she is a white woman but if she is colored it does not hinder his continuing to be their good shepherd When I was told that Dr Flint had joined the Episcopal church I was much surprised I supposed that religion had a purifying effect on the character of men but the worst persecutions I endured from him were after he was a communicant The conversation of the doctor the day after he had been confirmed certainly gave me no indication that he had renounced the devil and all his works In answer to some of his usual talk I reminded him that he had just joined the church Yes Linda said he It was proper for me to do so I am getting in years and my position in society requires it and it puts an end to all the damned slang You would do well to join the church too Linda There are sinners enough in it already rejoined I If I could be allowed to live like a Christian I should be glad You can do what I require and if you are faithful to me you will be as virtuous as my wife he replied I answered that the Bible didn't say so His voice became hoarse with rage How dare you preach to me about your infernal Bible he exclaimed What right have you who are my negro to talk to me about what you would like and what you wouldn't like I am your master and you shall obey me No wonder the slaves sing Ole Satan's church is here below Up to God's free church I hope to go XIV ANOTHER LINK TO LIFE I HAD not returned to my master's house since the birth of my child The old man raved to have me thus removed from his immediate power but his wife vowed by all that was good and great she would kill me if I came back and he did not doubt her word Sometimes he would stay away for a season Then he would come and renew the old threadbare discourse about his forbearance and my ingratitude He labored most unnecessarily to convince me that I had lowered myself The venomous old reprobate had no need of descanting on that theme I felt humiliated enough My unconscious babe was the ever-present witness of my shame I listened with silent contempt when he talked about my having forfeited his good opinion but I shed bitter tears that I was no longer worthy of being respected by the good and pure Alas slavery still held me in its poisonous grasp There was no chance for me to be respectable There was no prospect of being able to lead a better life Sometimes when my master found that I still refused to accept what he called his kind offers he would threaten to sell my child Perhaps that will humble you said he Humble me Was I not already in the dust But his threat lacerated my heart I knew the law gave him power to fulfil it for slaveholders have been cunning enough to enact that the child shall follow the condition of the mother not of the father thus taking care that licentiousness shall not interfere with avarice This reflection made me clasp my innocent babe all the more firmly to my heart Horrid visions passed through my mind when I thought of his liability to fall into the slave trader's hands I wept over him and said O my child perhaps they will leave you in some cold cabin to die and then throw you into a hole as if you were a dog When Dr Flint learned that I was again to be a mother he was exasperated beyond measure He rushed from the house and returned with a pair of shears I had a fine head of hair and he often railed about my pride of arranging it nicely He cut every hair close to my head storming and swearing all the time I replied to some of his abuse and he struck me Some months before he had pitched me down stairs in a fit of passion and the injury I received was so serious that I was unable to turn myself in bed for many days He then said Linda I swear by God I will never raise my hand against you again but I knew that he would forget his promise After he discovered my situation he was like a restless spirit from the pit He came every day and I was subjected to such insults as no pen can describe I would not describe them if I could they were too low too revolting I tried to keep them from my grandmother's knowledge as much as I could I knew she had enough to sadden her life without having my troubles to bear When she saw the doctor treat me with violence and heard him utter oaths terrible enough to palsy a man's tongue she could not always hold her peace It was natural and motherlike that she should try to defend me but it only made matters worse When they told me my new-born babe was a girl my heart was heavier than it had ever been before Slavery is terrible for men but it is far more terrible for women Superadded to the burden common to all they have wrongs and sufferings and mortifications peculiarly their own Dr Flint had sworn that he would make me suffer to my last day for this new crime against him as he called it and as long as he had me in his power he kept his word On the fourth day after the birth of my babe he entered my room suddenly and commanded me to rise and bring my baby to him The nurse who took care of me had gone out of the room to prepare some nourishment and I was alone There was no alternative I rose took up my babe and crossed the room to where he sat Now stand there said he till I tell you to go back My child bore a strong resemblance to her father and to the deceased Mrs Sands her grandmother He noticed this and while I stood before him trembling with weakness he heaped upon me and my little one every vile epithet he could think of Even the grandmother in her grave did not escape his curses In the midst of his vituperations I fainted at his feet This recalled him to his senses He took the baby from my arms laid it on the bed dashed cold water on my face took me up and shook me violently to restore my consciousness before any one entered the room Just then my grandmother came in and he hurried out of the house I suffered in consequence of this treatment but I begged my friends to let me die rather than send for the doctor There was nothing I dreaded so much as his presence My life was spared and I was glad for the sake of my little ones Had it not been for these ties to life I should have been glad to be released by death though I had lived only nineteen years Always it gave me a pang that my children had no lawful claim to a name Their father offered his but if I had wished to accept the offer I dared not while my master lived Moreover I knew it would not be accepted at their baptism A Christian name they were at least entitled to and we resolved to call my boy for our dear good Benjamin who had gone far away from us My grandmother belonged to the church and she was very desirous of having the children christened I knew Dr Flint would forbid it and I did not venture to attempt it But chance favored me He was called to visit a patient out of town and was obliged to be absent during Sunday Now is the time said my grandmother we will take the children to church and have them christened When I entered the church recollections of my mother came over me and I felt subdued in spirit There she had presented me for baptism without any reason to feel ashamed She had been married and had such legal rights as slavery allows to a slave The vows had at least been sacred to her and she had never violated them I was glad she was not alive to know under what different circumstances her grandchildren were presented for baptism Why had my lot been so different from my mother's Her master had died when she was a child and she remained with her mistress till she married She was never in the power of any master and thus she escaped one class of the evils that generally fall upon slaves When my baby was about to be christened the former mistress of my father stepped up to me and proposed to give it her Christian name To this I added the surname of my father who had himself no legal right to it for my grandfather on the paternal side was a white gentleman What tangled skeins are the genealogies of slavery I loved my father but it mortified me to be obliged to bestow his name on my children When we left the church my father's old mistress invited me to go home with her She clasped a gold chain round my baby's neck I thanked her for this kindness but I did not like the emblem I wanted no chain to be fastened on my daughter not even if its links were of gold How earnestly I prayed that she might never feel the weight of slavery's chain whose iron entereth into the soul XV CONTINUED PERSECUTIONS MY children grew finely and Dr Flint would often say to me with an exulting smile These brats will bring me a handsome sum of money one of these days I thought to myself that God being my helper they should never pass into his hands It seemed to me I would rather see them killed than have them given up to his power The money for the freedom of myself and my children could be obtained but I derived no advantage from that circumstance Dr Flint loved money but he loved power more After much discussion my friends resolved on making another trial There was a slaveholder about to leave for Texas and he was commissioned to buy me He was to begin with nine hundred dollars and go up to twelve My master refused his offers Sir said he she don't belong to me She is my daughter's property and I have no right to sell her I mistrust that you come from her paramour If so you may tell him that he cannot buy her for any money neither can he buy her children The doctor came to see me the next day and my heart beat quicker as he entered I never had seen the old man tread with so majestic a step He seated himself and looked at me with withering scorn My children had learned to be afraid of him The little one would shut her eyes and hide her face on my shoulder whenever she saw him and Benny who was now nearly five years old often inquired What makes that bad man come here so many times Does he want to hurt us I would clasp the dear boy in my arms trusting that he would be free before he was old enough to solve the problem And now as the doctor sat there so grim and silent the child left his play and came and nestled up by me At last my tormentor spoke So you are left in disgust are you said he It is no more than I expected You remember I told you years ago that you would be treated so So he is tired of you Ha ha ha The virtuous madam don't like to hear about it does she Ha ha ha There was a sting in his calling me virtuous madam I no longer had the power of answering him as I had formerly done He continued So it seems you are trying to get up another intrigue Your new paramour came to me and offered to buy you but you may be assured you will not succeed You are mine and you shall be mine for life There lives no human being that can take you out of slavery I would have done it but you rejected my kind offer I told him I did not wish to get up any intrigue that I had never seen the man who offered to buy me Do you tell me I lie exclaimed he dragging me from my chair Will you say again that you never saw that man I answered I do say so He clinched my arm with a volley of oaths Ben began to scream I told him to go to his grandmother Don't you stir a step you wretch said he The child drew nearer to me and put his arms round me as if he wanted to protect me This was too much for my enraged master He caught him up and hurled him across the room I thought he was dead and rushed towards him to take him up Not yet exclaimed the doctor Let him lie there till he comes to Let me go Let me go I screamed or I will raise the whole house I struggled and got away but he clinched me again Somebody opened the door and he released me I picked up my insensible child and when I turned my tormentor was gone Anxiously I bent over the little form so pale and still and when the brown eyes at last opened I don't know whether I was very happy All the doctor's former persecutions were renewed He came morning noon and night No jealous lover ever watched a rival more closely than he watched me and the unknown slaveholder with whom he accused me of wishing to get up an intrigue When my grandmother was out of the way he searched every room to find him In one of his visits he happened to find a young girl whom he had sold to a trader a few days previous His statement was that he sold her because she had been too familiar with the overseer She had had a bitter life with him and was glad to be sold She had no mother and no near ties She had been torn from all her family years before A few friends had entered into bonds for her safety if the trader would allow her to spend with them the time that intervened between her sale and the gathering up of his human stock Such a favor was rarely granted It saved the trader the expense of board and jail fees and though the amount was small it was a weighty consideration in a slave-trader's mind Dr Flint always had an aversion to meeting slaves after he had sold them He ordered Rose out of the house but he was no longer her master and she took no notice of him For once the crushed Rose was the conqueror His gray eyes flashed angrily upon her but that was the extent of his power How came this girl here he exclaimed What right had you to allow it when you knew I had sold her I answered This is my grandmother's house and Rose came to see her I have no right to turn any body out of doors that comes here for honest purposes He gave me the blow that would have fallen upon Rose if she had still been his slave My grandmother's attention had been attracted by loud voices and she arrived in time to see a second blow dealt She was not a woman to let such an outrage in her own house go unrebuked The doctor undertook to explain that I had been insolent Her indignant feelings rose higher and higher and finally boiled over in words Get out of my house she exclaimed Go home and take care of your wife and children and you will have enough to do without watching my family He threw the birth of my children in her face and accused her of sanctioning the life I was leading She told him I was living with her by compulsion of his wife that he needn't accuse her for he was the one to blame he was the one who had caused all the trouble She grew more and more excited as she went on I tell you what Dr Flint said she you ain't got many more years to live and you'd better be saying your prayers It will take 'em all and more too to wash the dirt off your soul Do you know whom you are talking to he exclaimed She replied Yes I know very well who I am talking to He left the house in a great rage I looked at my grandmother Our eyes met Their angry expression had passed away but she looked sorrowful and wearyweary of incessant strife I wondered that it did not lessen her love for me but if it did she never showed it She was always kind always ready to sympathize with my troubles There might have been peace and contentment in that lovable home if it had not been for the demon Slavery The winter passed undisturbed by the doctor The beautiful spring came and when Nature resumes her loveliness the human soul is apt to revive also My drooping hopes came to life again with the flowers I was dreaming of freedom again more for my children's sake than my own I planned and I planned Obstacles hit against plans There seemed no way of overcoming them and yet I hoped Back came the wily doctor I was not at home when he called A friend had invited me to a small party and to gratify her I went To my great consternation a messenger came in haste to say that Dr Flint was at my grandmother's and insisted on seeing me They did not tell him where I was or he would have come and raised a disturbance in my friend's house They sent me a dark wrapper I threw it on and hurried home My speed did not save me the doctor had gone away in anger I dreaded the morning but I could not delay it it came warm and bright At an early hour the doctor came and asked me where I had been last night I told him He did not believe me and sent to my friend's house to ascertain the facts He came in the afternoon to assure me he was satisfied that I had spoken the truth He seemed to be in a facetious mood and I expected some jeers were coming I suppose you need some recreation said he but I am surprised at your being there among those negroes It was not the place for you Are you allowed to visit such people I understood this covert fling at the white gentleman who was my friend but I merely replied I went to visit my friends and any company they keep is good enough for me He went on to say I have seen very little of you of late but my interest in you is unchanged When I said I would have no more mercy on you I was rash I recall my words Linda you desire freedom for yourself and your children and you can obtain it only through me If you agree to what I am about to propose you and they shall be free There must be no communication of any kind between you and their father I will procure a cottage where you and the children can live together Your labor shall be light such as sewing for my family Think what is offered you Lindaa home and freedom Let the past be forgotten If I have been harsh with you at times your wilfulness drove me to it You know I exact obedience from my own children and I consider you as yet a child He paused for an answer but I remained silent Why don't you speak said he What more do you wait for Nothing sir Then you accept my offer No sir His anger was ready to break loose but he succeeded in curbing it and replied You have answered without thought But I must let you know there are two sides to my proposition if you reject the bright side you will be obliged to take the dark one You must either accept my offer or you and your children shall be sent to your young master's plantation there to remain till your young mistress is married and your children shall fare like the rest of the negro children I give you a week to consider of it He was shrewd but I knew he was not to be trusted I told him I was ready to give my answer now I will not receive it now he replied You act too much from impulse Remember that you and your children can be free a week from to-day if you choose On what a monstrous chance hung the destiny of my children I knew that my master's offer was a snare and that if I entered it escape would be impossible As for his promise I knew him so well that I was sure if he gave me free papers they would be so managed as to have no legal value The alternative was inevitable I resolved to go to the plantation But then I thought how completely I should be in his power and the prospect was apalling Even if I should kneel before him and implore him to spare me for the sake of my children I knew he would spurn me with his foot and my weakness would be his triumph Before the week expired I heard that young Mr Flint was about to be married to a lady of his own stamp I foresaw the position I should occupy in his establishment I had once been sent to the plantation for punishment and fear of the son had induced the father to recall me very soon My mind was made up I was resolved that I would foil my master and save my children or I would perish in the attempt I kept my plans to myself I knew that friends would try to dissuade me from them and I would not wound their feelings by rejecting their advice On the decisive day the doctor came and said he hoped I had made a wise choice I am ready to go to the plantation sir I replied Have you thought how important your decision is to your children said he I told him I had Very well Go to the plantation and my curse go with you he replied Your boy shall be put to work and he shall soon be sold and your girl shall be raised for the purpose of selling well Go your own ways He left the room with curses not to be repeated As I stood rooted to the spot my grandmother came and said Linda child what did you tell him I answered that I was going to the plantation Must you go said she Can't something be done to stop it I told her it was useless to try but she begged me not to give up She said she would go to the doctor and remind him how long and how faithfully she had served in the family and how she had taken her own baby from her breast to nourish his wife She would tell him I had been out of the family so long they would not miss me that she would pay them for my time and the money would procure a woman who had more strength for the situation than I had I begged her not to go but she persisted in saying He will listen to me Linda She went and was treated as I expected He coolly listened to what she said but denied her request He told her that what he did was for my good that my feelings were entirely above my situation and that on the plantation I would receive treatment that was suitable to my behavior My grandmother was much cast down I had my secret hopes but I must fight my battle alone I had a woman's pride and a mother's love for my children and I resolved that out of the darkness of this hour a brighter dawn should rise for them My master had power and law on his side I had a determined will There is might in each XVI SCENES AT THE PLANTATION EARLY the next morning I left my grandmother's with my youngest child My boy was ill and I left him behind I had many sad thoughts as the old wagon jolted on Hitherto I had suffered alone now my little one was to be treated as a slave As we drew near the great house I thought of the time when I was formerly sent there out of revenge I wondered for what purpose I was now sent I could not tell I resolved to obey orders so far as duty required but within myself I determined to make my stay as short as possible Mr Flint was waiting to receive us and told me to follow him up stairs to receive orders for the day My little Ellen was left below in the kitchen It was a change for her who had always been so carefully tended My young master said she might amuse herself in the yard This was kind of him since the child was hateful to his sight My task was to fit up the house for the reception of the bride In the midst of sheets tablecloths towels drapery and carpeting my head was as busy planning as were my fingers with the needle At noon I was allowed to go to Ellen She had sobbed herself to sleep I heard Mr Flint say to a neighbor I've got her down here and I'll soon take the town notions out of her head My father is partly to blame for her nonsense He ought to have broke her in long ago The remark was made within my hearing and it would have been quite as manly to have made it to my face He had said things to my face which might or might not have surprised his neighbor if he had known of them He was a chip of the old block I resolved to give him no cause to accuse me of being too much of a lady so far as work was concerned I worked day and night with wretchedness before me When I lay down beside my child I felt how much easier it would be to see her die than to see her master beat her about as I daily saw him beat other little ones The spirit of the mothers was so crushed by the lash that they stood by without courage to remonstrate How much more must I suffer before I should be broke in to that degree I wished to appear as contented as possible Sometimes I had an opportunity to send a few lines home and this brought up recollections that made it difficult for a time to seem calm and indifferent to my lot Notwithstanding my efforts I saw that Mr Flint regarded me with a suspicious eye Ellen broke down under the trials of her new life Separated from me with no one to look after her she wandered about and in a few days cried herself sick One day she sat under the window where I was at work crying that weary cry which makes a mother's heart bleed I was obliged to steel myself to bear it After a while it ceased I looked out and she was gone As it was near noon I ventured to go down in search of her The great house was raised two feet above the ground I looked under it and saw her about midway fast asleep I crept under and drew her out As I held her in my arms I thought how well it would be for her if she never waked up and I uttered my thought aloud I was startled to hear some one say Did you speak to me I looked up and saw Mr Flint standing beside me He said nothing further but turned frowning away That night he sent Ellen a biscuit and a cup of sweetened milk This generosity surprised me I learned afterwards that in the afternoon he had killed a large snake which crept from under the house and I supposed that incident had prompted his unusual kindness The next morning the old cart was loaded with shingles for town I put Ellen into it and sent her to her grandmother Mr Flint said I ought to have asked his permission I told him the child was sick and required attention which I had no time to give He let it pass for he was aware that I had accomplished much work in a little time I had been three weeks on the plantation when I planned a visit home It must be at night after every body was in bed I was six miles from town and the road was very dreary I was to go with a young man who I knew often stole to town to see his mother One night when all was quiet we started Fear gave speed to our steps and we were not long in performing the journey I arrived at my grandmother's Her bed room was on the first floor and the window was open the weather being warm I spoke to her and she awoke She let me in and closed the window lest some late passer-by should see me A light was brought and the whole household gathered round me some smiling and some crying I went to look at my children and thanked God for their happy sleep The tears fell as I leaned over them As I moved to leave Benny stirred I turned back and whispered Mother is here After digging at his eyes with his little fist they opened and he sat up in bed looking at me curiously Having satisfied himself that it was I he exclaimed O mother you ain't dead are you They didn't cut off your head at the plantation did they My time was up too soon and my guide was waiting for me I laid Benny back in his bed and dried his tears by a promise to come again soon Rapidly we retraced our steps back to the plantation About half way we were met by a company of four patrols Luckily we heard their horse's hoofs before they came in sight and we had time to hide behind a large tree They passed hallooing and shouting in a manner that indicated a recent carousal How thankful we were that they had not their dogs with them We hastened our footsteps and when we arrived on the plantation we heard the sound of the hand-mill The slaves were grinding their corn We were safely in the house before the horn summoned them to their labor I divided my little parcel of food with my guide knowing that he had lost the chance of grinding his corn and must toil all day in the field Mr Flint often took an inspection of the house to see that no one was idle The entire management of the work was trusted to me because he knew nothing about it and rather than hire a superintendent he contented himself with my arrangements He had often urged upon his father the necessity of having me at the plantation to take charge of his affairs and make clothes for the slaves but the old man knew him too well to consent to that arrangement When I had been working a month at the plantation the great aunt of Mr Flint came to make him a visit This was the good old lady who paid fifty dollars for my grandmother for the purpose of making her free when she stood on the auction block My grandmother loved this old lady whom we all called Miss Fanny She often came to take tea with us On such occasions the table was spread with a snow-white cloth and the china cups and silver spoons were taken from the old-fashioned buffet There were hot muffins tea rusks and delicious sweetmeats My grandmother kept two cows and the fresh cream was Miss Fanny's delight She invariably declared that it was the best in town The old ladies had cosey times together They would work and chat and sometimes while talking over old times their spectacles would get dim with tears and would have to be taken off and wiped When Miss Fanny bade us good by her bag was filled with grandmother's best cakes and she was urged to come again soon There had been a time when Dr Flint's wife came to take tea with us and when her children were also sent to have a feast of Aunt Marthy's nice cooking But after I became an object of her jealousy and spite she was angry with grandmother for giving a shelter to me and my children She would not even speak to her in the street This wounded my grandmother's feelings for she could not retain ill will against the woman whom she had nourished with her milk when a babe The doctor's wife would gladly have prevented our intercourse with Miss Fanny if she could have done it but fortunately she was not dependent on the bounty of the Flints She had enough to be independent and that is more than can ever be gained from charity however lavish it may be Miss Fanny was endeared to me by many recollections and I was rejoiced to see her at the plantation The warmth of her large loyal heart made the house seem pleasanter while she was in it She staid a week and I had many talks with her She said her principal object in coming was to see how I was treated and whether any thing could be done for me She inquired whether she could help me in any way I told her I believed not She condoled with me in her own peculiar way saying she wished that I and all my grandmother's family were at rest in our graves for not until then should she feel any peace about us The good old soul did not dream that I was planning to bestow peace upon her with regard to myself and my children not by death but by securing our freedom Again and again I had traversed those dreary twelve miles to and from the town and all the way I was meditating upon some means of escape for myself and my children My friends had made every effort that ingenuity could devise to effect our purchase but all their plans had proved abortive Dr Flint was suspicious and determined not to loosen his grasp upon us I could have made my escape alone but it was more for my helpless children than for myself that I longed for freedom Though the boon would have been precious to me above all price I would not have taken it at the expense of leaving them in slavery Every trial I endured every sacrifice I made for their sakes drew them closer to my heart and gave me fresh courage to beat back the dark waves that rolled and rolled over me in a seemingly endless night of storms The six weeks were nearly completed when Mr Flint's bride was expected to take possession of her own home The arrangements were all completed and Mr Flint said I had done well He expected to leave home on Saturday and return with his bride the following Wednesday After receiving various orders from him I ventured to ask permission to spend Sunday in town It was granted for which favor I was thankful It was the first I had ever asked of him and I intended it should be the last It needed more than one night to accomplish the project I had in view but the whole of Sunday would give me an opportunity I spent the Sabbath with my grandmother A calmer more beautiful day never came down out of heaven To me it was a day of conflicting emotions Perhaps it was the last day I should ever spend under that dear old sheltered roof Perhaps these were the last talks I should ever have with the faithful old friend of my whole life Perhaps it was the last time I and my children should be together Well better so I thought than that they should be slaves I knew the doom that awaited my fair baby in slavery and I determined to save her from it or perish in the attempt I went to make this vow at the graves of my poor parents in the burying-ground of the slaves There the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary be at rest There the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice of the oppressor the servant is free from his master I knelt by the graves of my parents and thanked God as I had often done before that they had not lived to witness my trials or to mourn over my sins I had received my mother's blessing when she died and in many an hour of tribulation I had seemed to hear her voice sometimes chiding me sometimes whispering loving words into my wounded heart I have shed many and bitter tears to think that when I am gone from my children they cannot remember me with such entire satisfaction as I remembered my mother The graveyard was in the woods and twilight was coming on Nothing broke the death-like stillness except the occasional twitter of a bird My spirit was overawed by the solemnity of the scene For more than ten years I had frequented this spot but never had it seemed to me so sacred as now A black stump at the head of my mother's grave was all that remained of a tree my father had planted His grave was marked by a small wooden board bearing his name the letters of which were nearly obliterated I knelt down and kissed them and poured forth a prayer to God for guidance and support in the perilous step I was about to take As I passed the wreck of the old meeting house where before Nat Turner's time the slaves had been allowed to meet for worship I seemed to hear my father's voice come from it bidding me not to tarry till I reached freedom or the grave I rushed on with renovated hopes My trust in God had been strengthened by that prayer among the graves My plan was to conceal myself at the house of a friend and remain there a few weeks till the search was over My hope was that the doctor would get discouraged and for fear of losing my value and also of subsequently finding my children among the missing he would consent to sell us and I knew somebody would buy us I had done all in my power to make my children comfortable during the time I expected to be separated from them I was packing my things when grandmother came into the room and asked what I was doing I am putting my things in order I replied I tried to look and speak cheerfully but her watchful eye detected something beneath the surface She drew me towards her and asked me to sit down She looked earnestly at me and said Linda do you want to kill your old grandmother Do you mean to leave your little helpless children I am old now and cannot do for your babies as I once did for you I replied that if I went away perhaps their father would be able to secure their freedom Ah my child said she don't trust too much to him Stand by your own children and suffer with them till death Nobody respects a mother who forsakes her children and if you leave them you will never have a happy moment If you go you will make me miserable the short time I have to live You would be taken and brought back and your sufferings would be dreadful Remember poor Benjamin Do give it up Linda Try to bear a little longer Things may turn out better than we expect My courage failed me in view of the sorrow I should bring on that faithful loving old heart I promised that I would try longer and that I would take nothing out of her house without her knowledge Whenever the children climbed on my knee or laid their heads on my lap she would say Poor little souls what would you do without a mother She don't love you as I do And she would hug them to her own bosom as if to reproach me for my want of affection but she knew all the while that I loved them better than my life I slept with her that night and it was the last time The memory of it haunted me for many a year On Monday I returned to the plantation and busied myself with preparations for the important day Wednesday came It was a beautiful day and the faces of the slaves were as bright as the sunshine The poor creatures were merry They were expecting little presents from the bride and hoping for better times under her administration I had no such hopes for them I knew that the young wives of slaveholders often thought their authority and importance would be best established and maintained by cruelty and what I had heard of young Mrs Flint gave me no reason to expect that her rule over them would be less severe than that of the master and overseer Truly the colored race are the most cheerful and forgiving people on the face of the earth That their masters sleep in safety is owing to their superabundance of heart and yet they look upon their sufferings with less pity than they would bestow on those of a horse or a dog I stood at the door with others to receive the bridegroom and bride She was a handsome delicate-looking girl and her face flushed with emotion at sight of her new home I thought it likely that visions of a happy future were rising before her It made me sad for I knew how soon clouds would come over her sunshine She examined every part of the house and told me she was delighted with the arrangements I had made I was afraid old Mrs Flint had tried to prejudice her against me and I did my best to please her All passed off smoothly for me until dinner time arrived I did not mind the embarrassment of waiting on a dinner party for the first time in my life half so much as I did the meeting with Dr Flint and his wife who would be among the guests It was a mystery to me why Mrs Flint had not made her appearance at the plantation during all the time I was putting the house in order I had not met her face to face for five years and I had no wish to see her now She was a praying woman and doubtless considered my present position a special answer to her prayers Nothing could please her better than to see me humbled and trampled upon I was just where she would have mein the power of a hard unprincipled master She did not speak to me when she took her seat at the table but her satisfied triumphant smile when I handed her plate was more eloquent than words The old doctor was not so quiet in his demonstrations He ordered me here and there and spoke with peculiar emphasis when he said your mistress I was drilled like a disgraced soldier When all was over and the last key turned I sought my pillow thankful that God had appointed a season of rest for the weary The next day my new mistress began her housekeeping I was not exactly appointed maid of all work but I was to do whatever I was told Monday evening came It was always a busy time On that night the slaves received their weekly allowance of food Three pounds of meat a peck of corn and perhaps a dozen herring were allowed to each man Women received a pound and a half of meat a peck of corn and the same number of herring Children over twelve years old had half the allowance of the women The meat was cut and weighed by the foreman of the field hands and piled on planks before the meat house Then the second foreman went behind the building and when the first foreman called out Who takes this piece of meat he answered by calling somebody's name This method was resorted to as a means of preventing partiality in distributing the meat The young mistress came out to see how things were done on her plantation and she soon gave a specimen of her character Among those in waiting for their allowance was a very old slave who had faithfully served the Flint family through three generations When he hobbled up to get his bit of meat the mistress said he was too old to have any allowance that when niggers were too old to work they ought to be fed on grass Poor old man He suffered much before he found rest in the grave My mistress and I got along very well together At the end of a week old Mrs Flint made us another visit and was closeted a long time with her daughter-in-law I had my suspicions what was the subject of the conference The old doctor's wife had been informed that I could leave the plantation on one condition and she was very desirous to keep me there If she had trusted me as I deserved to be trusted by her she would have had no fears of my accepting that condition When she entered her carriage to return home she said to young Mrs Flint Don't neglect to send for them as quick as possible My heart was on the watch all the time and I at once concluded that she spoke of my children The doctor came the next day and as I entered the room to spread the tea table I heard him say Don't wait any longer Send for them to-morrow I saw through the plan They thought my children's being there would fetter me to the spot and that it was a good place to break us all in to abject submission to our lot as slaves After the doctor left a gentleman called who had always manifested friendly feelings towards my grandmother and her family Mr Flint carried him over the plantation to show him the results of labor performed by men and women who were unpaid miserably clothed and half famished The cotton crop was all they thought of It was duly admired and the gentleman returned with specimens to show his friends I was ordered to carry water to wash his hands As I did so he said Linda how do you like your new home I told him I liked it as well as I expected He replied They don't think you are contented and to-morrow they are going to bring your children to be with you I am sorry for you Linda I hope they will treat you kindly I hurried from the room unable to thank him My suspicions were correct My children were to be brought to the plantation to be broke in To this day I feel grateful to the gentleman who gave me this timely information It nerved me to immediate action XVII THE FLIGHT MR FLINT was hard pushed for house servants and rather than lose me he had restrained his malice I did my work faithfully though not of course with a willing mind They were evidently afraid I should leave them Mr Flint wished that I should sleep in the great house instead of the servants' quarters His wife agreed to the proposition but said I mustn't bring my bed into the house because it would scatter feathers on her carpet I knew when I went there that they would never think of such a thing as furnishing a bed of any kind for me and my little one I therefore carried my own bed and now I was forbidden to use it I did as I was ordered But now that I was certain my children were to be put in their power in order to give them a stronger hold on me I resolved to leave them that night I remembered the grief this step would bring upon my dear old grandmother and nothing less than the freedom of my children would have induced me to disregard her advice I went about my evening work with trembling steps Mr Flint twice called from his chamber door to inquire why the house was not locked up I replied that I had not done my work You have had time enough to do it said he Take care how you answer me I shut all the windows locked all the doors and went up to the third story to wait till midnight How long those hours seemed and how fervently I prayed that God would not forsake me in this hour of utmost need I was about to risk every thing on the throw of a die and if I failed O what would become of me and my poor children They would be made to suffer for my fault At half past twelve I stole softly down stairs I stopped on the second floor thinking I heard a noise I felt my way down into the parlor and looked out of the window The night was so intensely dark that I could see nothing I raised the window very softly and jumped out Large drops of rain were falling and the darkness bewildered me I dropped on my knees and breathed a short prayer to God for guidance and protection I groped my way to the road and rushed towards the town with almost lightning speed I arrived at my grandmother's house but dared not see her She would say Linda you are killing me and I knew that would unnerve me I tapped softly at the window of a room occupied by a woman who had lived in the house several years I knew she was a faithful friend and could be trusted with my secret I tapped several times before she heard me At last she raised the window and I whispered Sally I have run away Let me in quick She opened the door softly and said in low tones For God's sake don't Your grandmother is trying to buy you and de chillern Mr Sands was here last week He tole her he was going away on business but he wanted her to go ahead about buying you and de chillern and he would help her all he could Don't run away Linda Your grandmother is all bowed down wid trouble now I replied Sally they are going to carry my children to the plantation to-morrow and they will never sell them to any body so long as they have me in their power Now would you advise me to go back No chile no answered she When dey finds you is gone dey won't want de plague ob de chillern but where is you going to hide Dey knows ebery inch ob dis house I told her I had a hiding-place and that was all it was best for her to know I asked her to go into my room as soon as it was light and take all my clothes out of my trunk and pack them in hers for I knew Mr Flint and the constable would be there early to search my room I feared the sight of my children would be too much for my full heart but I could not go out into the uncertain future without one last look I bent over the bed where lay my little Benny and baby Ellen Poor little ones fatherless and motherless Memories of their father came over me He wanted to be kind to them but they were not all to him as they were to my womanly heart I knelt and prayed for the innocent little sleepers I kissed them lightly and turned away As I was about to open the street door Sally laid her hand on my shoulder and said Linda is you gwine all alone Let me call your uncle No Sally I replied I want no one to be brought into trouble on my account I went forth into the darkness and rain I ran on till I came to the house of the friend who was to conceal me Early the next morning Mr Flint was at my grandmother's inquiring for me She told him she had not seen me and supposed I was at the plantation He watched her face narrowly and said Don't you know any thing about her running off She assured him that she did not He went on to say Last night she ran off without the least provocation We had treated her very kindly My wife liked her She will soon be found and brought back Are her children with you When told that they were he said I am very glad to hear that If they are here she cannot be far off If I find out that any of my niggers have had any thing to do with this damned business I'll give 'em five hundred lashes As he started to go to his father's he turned round and added persuasively Let her be brought back and she shall have her children to live with her The tidings made the old doctor rave and storm at a furious rate It was a busy day for them My grandmother's house was searched from top to bottom As my trunk was empty they concluded I had taken my clothes with me Before ten o'clock every vessel northward bound was thoroughly examined and the law against harboring fugitives was read to all on board At night a watch was set over the town Knowing how distressed my grandmother would be I wanted to send her a message but it could not be done Every one who went in or out of her house was closely watched The doctor said he would take my children unless she became responsible for them which of course she willingly did The next day was spent in searching Before night the following advertisement was posted at every corner and in every public place for miles round REWARD Ran away from the subscriber an intelligent bright mulatto girl named Linda years age Five feet four inches high Dark eyes and black hair inclined to curl but it can be made straight Has a decayed spot on a front tooth She can read and write and in all probability will try to get to the Free States All persons are forbidden under penalty of the law to harbor or employ said slave will be given to whoever takes her in the state and if taken out of the state and delivered to me or lodged in jail DR FLINT XVIII MONTHS OF PERIL THE search for me was kept up with more perseverence than I had anticipated I began to think that escape was impossible I was in great anxiety lest I should implicate the friend who harbored me I knew the consequences would be frightful and much as I dreaded being caught even that seemed better than causing an innocent person to suffer for kindness to me A week had passed in terrible suspense when my pursuers came into such close vicinity that I concluded they had tracked me to my hiding-place I flew out of the house and concealed myself in a thicket of bushes There I remained in an agony of fear for two hours Suddenly a reptile of some kind seized my leg In my fright I struck a blow which loosened its hold but I could not tell whether I had killed it it was so dark I could not see what it was I only knew it was something cold and slimy The pain I felt soon indicated that the bite was poisonous I was compelled to leave my place of concealment and I groped my way back into the house The pain had become intense and my friend was startled by my look of anguish I asked her to prepare a poultice of warm ashes and vinegar and I applied it to my leg which was already much swollen The application gave me some relief but the swelling did not abate The dread of being disabled was greater than the physical pain I endured My friend asked an old woman who doctored among the slaves what was good for the bite of a snake or a lizard She told her to steep a dozen coppers in vinegar over night and apply the cankered vinegar to the inflamed part I had succeeded in cautiously conveying some messages to my relatives They were harshly threatened and despairing of my having a chance to escape they advised me to return to my master ask his forgiveness and let him make an example of me But such counsel had no influence on me When I started upon this hazardous undertaking I had resolved that come what would there should be no turning back Give me liberty or give me death was my motto When my friend contrived to make known to my relatives the painful situation I had been in for twenty-four hours they said no more about my going back to my master Something must be done and that speedily but where to turn for help they knew not God in his mercy raised up a friend in need Among the ladies who were acquainted with my grandmother was one who had known her from childhood and always been very friendly to her She had also known my mother and her children and felt interested for them At this crisis of affairs she called to see my grandmother as she not unfrequently did She observed the sad and troubled expression of her face and asked if she knew where Linda was and whether The poison of a snake is a powerful acid and is counteracted by powerful alkalies such as potash ammonia c The Indians are accustomed to apply wet ashes or plunge the limb into strong lie White men employed to lay out railroads in snaky places often carry ammonia with them as an antidoteEDITOR she was safe My grandmother shook her head without answering Come Aunt Martha said the kind lady tell me all about it Perhaps I can do something to help you The husband of this lady held many slaves and bought and sold slaves She also held a number in her own name but she treated them kindly and would never allow any of them to be sold She was unlike the majority of slaveholders' wives My grandmother looked earnestly at her Something in the expression of her face said Trust me and she did trust her She listened attentively to the details of my story and sat thinking for a while At last she said Aunt Martha I pity you both If you think there is any chance of Linda's getting to the Free States I will conceal her for a time But first you must solemnly promise that my name shall never be mentioned If such a thing should become known it would ruin me and my family No one in my house must know of it except the cook She is so faithful that I would trust my own life with her and I know she likes Linda It is a great risk but I trust no harm will come of it Get word to Linda to be ready as soon as it is dark before the patrols are out I will send the housemaids on errands and Betty shall go to meet Linda The place where we were to meet was designated and agreed upon My grandmother was unable to thank the lady for this noble deed overcome by her emotions she sank on her knees and sobbed like a child I received a message to leave my friend's house at such an hour and go to a certain place where a friend would be waiting for me As a matter of prudence no names were mentioned I had no means of conjecturing who I was to meet or where I was going I did not like to move thus blindfolded but I had no choice It would not do for me to remain where I was I disguised myself summoned up courage to meet the worst and went to the appointed place My friend Betty was there she was the last person I expected to see We hurried along in silence The pain in my leg was so intense that it seemed as if I should drop but fear gave me strength We reached the house and entered unobserved Her first words were Honey now you is safe Dem devils ain't coming to search dis house When I get you into missis' safe place I will bring some nice hot supper I specs you need it after all dis skeering Betty's vocation led her to think eating the most important thing in life She did not realize that my heart was too full for me to care much about supper The mistress came to meet us and led me up stairs to a small room over her own sleeping apartment You will be safe here Linda said she I keep this room to store away things that are out of use The girls are not accustomed to be sent to it and they will not suspect anything unless they hear some noise I always keep it locked and Betty shall take care of the key But you must be very careful for my sake as well as your own and you must never tell my secret for it would ruin me and my family I will keep the girls busy in the morning that Betty may have a chance to bring your breakfast but it will not do for her to come to you again till night I will come to see you sometimes Keep up your courage I hope this state of things will not last long Betty came with the nice hot supper and the mistress hastened down stairs to keep things straight till she returned How my heart overflowed with gratitude Words choked in my throat but I could have kissed the feet of my benefactress For that deed of Christian womanhood may God forever bless her I went to sleep that night with the feeling that I was for the present the most fortunate slave in town Morning came and filled my little cell with light I thanked the heavenly Father for this safe retreat Opposite my window was a pile of feather beds On the top of these I could lie perfectly concealed and command a view of the street through which Dr Flint passed to his office Anxious as I was I felt a gleam of satisfaction when I saw him Thus far I had outwitted him and I triumphed over it Who can blame slaves for being cunning They are constantly compelled to resort to it It is the only weapon of the weak and oppressed against the strength of their tyrants I was daily hoping to hear that my master had sold my children for I knew who was on the watch to buy them But Dr Flint cared even more for revenge than he did for money My brother William and the good aunt who had served in his family twenty years and my little Benny and Ellen who was a little over two years old were thrust into jail as a means of compelling my relatives to give some information about me He swore my grandmother should never see one of them again till I was brought back They kept these facts from me for several days When I heard that my little ones were in a loathsome jail my first impulse was to go to them I was encountering dangers for the sake of freeing them and must I be the cause of their death The thought was agonizing My benefactress tried to soothe me by telling me that my aunt would take good care of the children while they remained in jail But it added to my pain to think that the good old aunt who had always been so kind to her sister's orphan children should be shut up in prison for no other crime than loving them I suppose my friends feared a reckless movement on my part knowing as they did that my life was bound up in my children I received a note from my brother William It was scarcely legible and ran thus Wherever you are dear sister I beg of you not to come here We are all much better off than you are If you come you will ruin us all They would force you to tell where you had been or they would kill you Take the advice of your friends if not for the sake of me and your children at least for the sake of those you would ruin Poor William He also must suffer for being my brother I took his advice and kept quiet My aunt was taken out of jail at the end of a month because Mrs Flint could not spare her any longer She was tired of being her own housekeeper It was quite too fatiguing to order her dinner and eat it too My children remained in jail where brother William did all he could for their comfort Betty went to see them sometimes and brought me tidings She was not permitted to enter the jail but William would hold them up to the grated window while she chatted with them When she repeated their prattle and told me how they wanted to see their ma my tears would flow Old Betty would exclaim Lors chile what's you crying 'bout Dem young uns vil kill you dead Don't be so chick'n hearted If you does you vil nebber git thro' dis world Good old soul She had gone through the world childless She had never had little ones to clasp their arms round her neck she had never seen their soft eyes looking into hers no sweet little voices had called her mother she had never pressed her own infants to her heart with the feeling that even in fetters there was something to live for How could she realize my feelings Betty's husband loved children dearly and wondered why God had denied them to him He expressed great sorrow when he came to Betty with the tidings that Ellen had been taken out of jail and carried to Dr Flint's She had the measles a short time before they carried her to jail and the disease had left her eyes affected The doctor had taken her home to attend to them My children had always been afraid of the doctor and his wife They had never been inside of their house Poor little Ellen cried all day to be carried back to prison The instincts of childhood are true She knew she was loved in the jail Her screams and sobs annoyed Mrs Flint Before night she called one of the slaves and said Here Bill carry this brat back to the jail I can't stand her noise If she would be quiet I should like to keep the little minx She would make a handy waiting maid for my daughter by and by But if she staid here with her white face I suppose I should either kill her or spoil her I hope the doctor will sell them as far as wind and water can carry them As for their mother her ladyship will find out yet what she gets by running away She hasn't so much feeling for her children as a cow has for its calf If she had she would have come back long ago to get them out of jail and save all this expense and trouble The good-for-nothing hussy When she is caught she shall stay in jail in irons for one six months and then be sold to a sugar plantation I shall see her broke in yet What do you stand there for Bill Why don't you go off with the brat Mind now that you don't let any of the niggers speak to her in the street When these remarks were reported to me I smiled at Mrs Flint's saying that she should either kill my child or spoil her I thought to myself there was very little danger of the latter I have always considered it as one of God's special providences that Ellen screamed till was carried back to jail That same night Dr Flint was called to a patient and did not return till near morning Passing my grandmother's he saw a light in the house and thought to himself Perhaps this has something to do with Linda He knocked and the door was opened What calls you up so early said he I saw your light and I thought I would just stop and tell you that I have found out where Linda is I know where to put my hands on her and I shall have her before twelve o'clock When he had turned away my grandmother and my uncle looked anxiously at each other They did not know whether or not it was merely one of the doctor's tricks to frighten them In their uncertainty they thought it was best to have a message conveyed to my friend Betty Unwilling to alarm her mistress Betty resolved to dispose of me herself She came to me and told me to rise and dress quickly We hurried down stairs and across the yard into the kitchen She locked the door and lifted up a plank in the floor A buffalo skin and a bit of carpet were spread for me to lie on and a quilt thrown over me Stay dar said she till I sees if dey know 'bout you Dey say dey vil put thar hans on you afore twelve o'clock If dey did know whar you are dey won't know now Dey'll be disapinted dis time Dat's all I got to say If dey comes rummagin 'mong my tings dey'll get one bressed sarssin from dis 'ere nigger In my shallow bed I had but just room enough to bring my hands to my face to keep the dust out of my eyes for Betty walked over me twenty times in an hour passing from the dresser to the fireplace When she was alone I could hear her pronouncing anathemas over Dr Flint and all his tribe every now and then saying with a chuckling laugh Dis nigger's too cute for 'em dis time When the housemaids were about she had sly ways of drawing them out that I might hear what they would say She would repeat stories she had heard about my being in this or that or the other place To which they would answer that I was not fool enough to be staying round there that I was in Philadelphia or New York before this time When all were abed and asleep Betty raised the plank and said Come out chile come out Dey don't know nottin 'bout you 'Twas only white folks' lies to skeer de niggers Some days after this adventure I had a much worse fright As I sat very still in my retreat above stairs cheerful visions floated through my mind I thought Dr Flint would soon get discouraged and would be willing to sell my children when he lost all hopes of making them the means of my discovery I knew who was ready to buy them Suddenly I heard a voice that chilled my blood The sound was too familiar to me it had been too dreadful for me not to recognize at once my old master He was in the house and I at once concluded that he had come to seize me I looked round in terror There was no way of escape The voice receded I supposed the constable was with him and they were searching the house In my alarm I did not forget the trouble I was bringing on my generous benefactress It seemed as if I were born to bring sorrow on all who befriended me and that was the bitterest drop in the bitter cup of my life After a while I heard approaching footsteps the key was turned in my door I braced myself against the wall to keep from falling I ventured to look up and there stood my kind benefactress I was too much overcome to speak and sunk down upon the floor I thought you would hear your master's voice she said and knowing you would be terrified I came to tell you there is nothing to fear You may even indulge in a laugh at the old gentleman's expense He is so sure you are in New York that he came to borrow five hundred dollars to go in pursuit of you My sister had some money to loan on interest He has obtained it and proposes to start for New York to-night So for the present you see you are safe The doctor will merely lighten his pocket hunting after the bird he has left behind XIX THE CHILDREN SOLD THE doctor came back from New York of course without accomplishing his purpose He had expended considerable money and was rather disheartened My brother and the children had now been in jail two months and that also was some expense My friends thought it was a favorable time to work on his discouraged feelings Mr Sands sent a speculator to offer him nine hundred dollars for my brother William and eight hundred for the two children These were high prices as slaves were then selling but the offer was rejected If it had been merely a question of money the doctor would have sold any boy of Benny's age for two hundred dollars but he could not bear to give up the power of revenge But he was hard pressed for money and he revolved the matter in his mind He knew that if he could keep Ellen till she was fifteen he could sell her for a high price but I presume he reflected that she might die or might be stolen away At all events he came to the conclusion that he had better accept the slave-trader's offer Meeting him in the street he inquired when he would leave town To-day at ten o'clock he replied Ah do you go so soon said the doctor I have been reflecting upon your proposition and I have concluded to let you have the three negroes if you will say nineteen hundred dollars After some parley the trader agreed to his terms He wanted the bill of sale drawn up and signed immediately as he had a great deal to attend to during the short time he remained in town The doctor went to the jail and told William he would take him back into his service if he would promise to behave himself but he replied that he would rather be sold And you shall be sold you ungrateful rascal exclaimed the doctor In less than an hour the money was paid the papers were signed sealed and delivered and my brother and children were in the hands of the trader It was a hurried transaction and after it was over the doctor's characteristic caution returned He went back to the speculator and said Sir I have come to lay you under obligations of a thousands dollars not to sell any of those negroes in this state You come too late replied the trader our bargain is closed He had in fact already sold them to Mr Sands but he did not mention it The doctor required him to put irons on that rascal Bill and to pass through the back streets when he took his gang out of town The trader was privately instructed to concede to his wishes My good old aunt went to jail to bid the children good by supposing them to be the speculator's property and that she should never see them again As she held Benny in her lap he said Aunt Nancy I want to show you something He led her to the door and showed her a long row of marks saying Uncle Will taught me to count I have made a mark for every day I have been here and it is sixty days It is a long time and the speculator is going to take me and Ellen away He's a bad man It's wrong for him to take grandmother's children I want to go to my mother My grandmother was told that the children would be restored to her but she was requested to act as if they were really to be sent away Accordingly she made up a bundle of clothes and went to the jail When she arrived she found William handcuffed among the gang and the children in the trader's cart The scene seemed too much like a reality She was afraid there might have been some deception or mistake She fainted and was carried home When the wagon stopped at the hotel several gentlemen came out and proposed to purchase William but the trader refused their offers without stating that he was already sold And now came the trying hour for that drove of human beings driven away like cattle to be sold they knew not where Husbands were torn from wives parents from children never to look upon each other again this side the grave There was wringing of hands and cries of despair Dr Flint had the supreme satisfaction of seeing the wagon leave town and Mrs Flint had the gratification of supposing that my children were going as far as wind and water would carry them According to the agreement my uncle followed the wagon some miles until they came to an old farm house There the trader took the irons from William and as he did so he said You are a damned clever fellow I should like to own you myself Them gentlemen that wanted to buy you said you was a bright honest chap and I must git you a good home I guess your old master will swear to-morrow and call himself an old fool for selling the children I reckon he'll never git their mammy back agin I expect she's made tracks for the north Good by old boy Remember I have done you a good turn You must thank me by coaxing all the pretty gals to go with me next fall That's going to be my last trip The trading in niggers is a bad business for a fellow that's got any heart Move on you fellows And the gang went on God alone knows where Much as I despise and detest the class of slave-traders whom I regard as the vilest wretches on earth I must do this man the justice to say that he seemed to have some feeling He took a fancy to William in the jail and wanted to buy him When he heard the story of my children he was willing to aid them in getting out of Dr Flint's power even without charging the customary fee My uncle procured a wagon and carried William and the children back to town Great was the joy in my grandmother's house The curtains were closed and the candles lighted The happy grandmother cuddled the little ones to her bosom They hugged her and kissed her and clapped their hands and shouted She knelt down and poured forth one of her heartfelt prayers of thanksgiving to God The father was present for awhile and though such a parental relation as existed between him and my children takes slight hold of the heart or consciences of slaveholders it must be that he experienced some moments of pure joy in witnessing the happiness he had imparted I had no share in the rejoicings of that evening The events of that day had not come to my knowledge And now I will tell you something that happened to me though you will perhaps think it illustrates the superstition of slaves I sat in my usual place on the floor near the window where I could hear much that was said in the street without being seen The family had retired for the night and all was still I sat there thinking of my children when I heard a low strain of music A band of serenaders were under the window playing Home sweet home I listened till the sounds did not seem like music but like the moaning of children It seemed as if my heart would burst I rose from my sitting posture and knelt A streak of moonlight was on the floor before me and in the midst of it appeared the forms of my two children They vanished but I had seen them distinctly Some will call it a dream others a vision I know not how to account for it but it made a strong impression on my mind and I felt certain something had happened to my little ones I had not seen Betty since morning Now I heard her softly turning the key As soon as she entered I clung to her and begged her to let me know whether my children were dead or whether they were sold for I had seen their spirits in my room and I was sure something had happened to them Lor chile said she putting her arms round me you's got de highsterics I'll sleep wid you to-night 'cause you'll make a noise and ruin missis Something has stirred you up mightily When you is done cryin I'll talk wid you De chillern is well and mighty happy I seed 'em myself Does dat satisfy you Dar chile be still Somebody vill hear you I tried to obey her She lay down and was soon sound asleep but no sleep would come to my eyelids At dawn Betty was up and off to the kitchen The hours passed on and the vision of the night kept constantly recurring to my thought After a while I heard the voices of two women in the entry In one of them I recognized the housemaid The other said to her Did you know Linda Brent's children was sold to the speculator yesterday They say ole massa Flint was mighty glad to see 'em drove out of town but they say they've come back agin I 'spect it's all their daddy's doings They say he's bought William too Lor how it will take hold of ole massa Flint I'm going roun' to aunt Marthy's to see 'bout it I bit my lips till the blood came to keep from crying out Were my children with their grandmother or had the speculator carried them off The suspense was dreadful Would Betty never come and tell me the truth about it At last she came and I eagerly repeated what I had overheard Her face was one broad bright smile Lor you foolish ting said she I'se gwine to tell you all bout it De gals is eating thar breakfast and missus tole me to let her tell you but poor creeter t'aint right to keep you waitin' and I'se gwine to tell you Brudder chillern all is bought by de daddy I'se laugh more dan nuff tinking 'bout ole massa Flint Lor how he vill swar He's got ketched dis time and how but I must be getting out o' dis or dem gals vill come and ketch me Betty went off laughing and I said to myself Can it be true that my children are free I have not suffered for them in vain Thank God Great surprise was expressed when it was known that my children had returned to their grandmother's The news spread through town and many a kind word was bestowed on the little ones Dr Flint went to my grandmother's to ascertain who was the owner of my children and she informed him I expected as much said he I am glad to hear it I have had news from Linda lately and I shall soon have her You need never expect to see her free She shall be my slave as long as I live and when I am dead she shall be the slave of my children If I ever find out that you or Phillip had any thing to do with her running off I'll kill him And if I meet William in the street and he presumes to look at me I'll flog him within an inch of his life Keep those brats out of my sight As he turned to leave my grandmother said something to remind him of his own doings He looked back upon her as if he would have been glad to strike her to the ground I had my season of joy and thanksgiving It was the first time since my childhood that I had experienced any real happiness I heard of the old doctor's threats but they no longer had the same power to trouble me The darkest cloud that hung over my life had rolled away Whatever slavery might do to me it could not shackle my children If I fell a sacrifice my little ones were saved It was well for me that my simple heart believed all that had been promised for their welfare It is always better to trust than to doubt XX NEW PERILS THE doctor more exasperated than ever again tried to revenge himself on my relatives He arrested uncle Phillip on the charge of having aided my flight He was carried before a court and swore truly that he knew nothing of my intention to escape and that he had not seen me since I left my master's plantation The doctor then demanded that he should give bail for five hundred dollars that he would have nothing to do with me Several gentlemen offered to be security for him but Mr Sands told him he had better go back to jail and he would see that he came out without giving bail The news of his arrest was carried to my grandmother who conveyed it to Betty In the kindness of her heart she again stowed me away under the floor and as she walked back and forth in the performance of her culinary duties she talked apparently to herself but with the intention that I should hear what was going on I hoped that my uncle's imprisonment would last but few days still I was anxious I thought it likely that Dr Flint would do his utmost to taunt and insult him and I was afraid my uncle might lose control of himself and retort in some way that would be construed into a punishable offence and I was well aware that in court his word would not be taken against any white man's The search for me was renewed Something had excited suspicions that I was in the vicinity They searched the house I was in I heard their steps and their voices At night when all were asleep Betty came to release me from my place of confinement The fright I had undergone the constrained posture and the dampness of the ground made me ill for several days My uncle was soon after taken out of prison but the movements of all my relatives and of all our friends were very closely watched We all saw that I could not remain where I was much longer I had already staid longer than was intended and I knew my presence must be a source of perpetual anxiety to my kind benefactress During this time my friends had laid many plans for my escape but the extreme vigilance of my persecutors made it impossible to carry them into effect One morning I was much startled by hearing somebody trying to get into my room Several keys were tried but none fitted I instantly conjectured it was one of the housemaids and I concluded she must either have heard some noise in the room or have noticed the entrance of Betty When my friend came at her usual time I told her what had happened I knows who it was said she 'Pend upon it 'twas dat Jenny Dat nigger allers got de debble in her I suggested that she might have seen or heard something that excited her curiosity Tut tut chile exclaimed Betty she ain't seen notin' nor hearn notin' She only 'spects something Dat's all She wants to fine out who hab cut and make my gownd But she won't nebber know Dat's sartin I'll git missis to fix her I reflected a moment and said Betty I must leave here to-night Do as you tink best poor chile she replied I'se mighty 'fraid dat 'ere nigger vill pop on you some time She reported the incident to her mistress and received orders to keep Jenny busy in the kitchen till she could see my uncle Phillip He told her he would send a friend for me that very evening She told him she hoped I was going to the north for it was very dangerous for me to remain any where in the vicinity Alas it was not an easy thing for one in my situation to go to the north In order to leave the coast quite clear for me she went into the country to spend the day with her brother and took Jenny with her She was afraid to come and bid me good by but she left a kind message with Betty I heard her carriage roll from the door and I never again saw her who had so generously befriended the poor trembling fugitive Though she was a slaveholder to this day my heart blesses her I had not the slightest idea where I was going Betty brought me a suit of sailor's clothesjacket trousers and tarpaulin hat She gave me a small bundle saying I might need it where I was going In cheery tones she exclaimed I'se so glad you is gwine to free parts Don't forget ole Betty P'raps I'll come 'long by and by I tried to tell her how grateful I felt for all her kindness but she interrupted me I don't want no tanks honey I'se glad I could help you and I hope de good Lord vill open de path for you I'se gwine wid you to de lower gate Put your hands in your pockets and walk ricketty like de sailors I performed to her satisfaction At the gate I found Peter a young colored man waiting for me I had known him for years He had been an apprentice to my father and had always borne a good character I was not afraid to trust to him Betty bade me a hurried good by and we walked off Take courage Linda said my friend Peter I've got a dagger and no man shall take you from me unless he passes over my dead body It was a long time since I had taken a walk out of doors and the fresh air revived me It was also pleasant to hear a human voice speaking to me above a whisper I passed several people whom I knew but they did not recognize me in my disguise I prayed internally that for Peter's sake as well as my own nothing might occur to bring out his dagger We walked on till we came to the wharf My aunt Nancy's husband was a seafaring man and it had been deemed necessary to let him into our secret He took me into his boat rowed out to a vessel not far distant and hoisted me on board We three were the only occupants of the vessel I now ventured to ask what they proposed to do with me They said I was to remain on board till near dawn and then they would hide me in Snaky Swamp till my uncle Phillip had prepared a place of concealment for me If the vessel had been bound north it would have been of no avail to me for it would certainly have been searched About four o'clock we were again seated in the boat and rowed three miles to the swamp My fear of snakes had been increased by the venomous bite I had received and I dreaded to enter this hiding-place But I was in no situation to choose and I gratefully accepted the best that my poor persecuted friends could do for me Peter landed first and with a large knife cut a path through bamboos and briers of all descriptions He came back took me in his arms and carried me to a seat made among the bamboos Before we reached it we were covered with hundreds of mosquitos In an hour's time they had so poisoned my flesh that I was a pitiful sight to behold As the light increased I saw snake after snake crawling round us I had been accustomed to the sight of snakes all my life but these were larger than any I had ever seen To this day I shudder when I remember that morning As evening approached the number of snakes increased so much that we were continually obliged to thrash them with sticks to keep them from crawling over us The bamboos were so high and so thick that it was impossible to see beyond a very short distance Just before it became dark we procured a seat nearer to the entrance of the swamp being fearful of losing our way back to the boat It was not long before we heard the paddle of oars and the low whistle which had been agreed upon as a signal We made haste to enter the boat and were rowed back to the vessel I passed a wretched night for the heat of the swamp the mosquitos and the constant terror of snakes had brought on a burning fever I had just dropped asleep when they came and told me it was time to go back to that horrid swamp I could scarcely summon courage to rise But even those large venomous snakes were less dreadful to my imagination than the white men in that community called civilized This time Peter took a quantity of tobacco to burn to keep off the mosquitos It produced the desired effect on them but gave me nausea and severe headache At dark we returned to the vessel I had been so sick during the day that Peter declared I should go home that night if the devil himself was on patrol They told me a place of concealment had been provided for me at my grandmother's I could not imagine how it was possible to hide me in her house every nook and corner of which was known to the Flint family They told me to wait and see We were rowed ashore and went boldly through the streets to my grandmother's I wore my sailor's clothes and had blackened my face with charcoal I passed several people whom I knew The father of my children came so near that I brushed against his arm but he had no idea who it was You must make the most of this walk said my friend Peter for you may not have another very soon I thought his voice sounded sad It was kind of him to conceal from me what a dismal hole was to be my home for a long long time XXI THE LOOPHOLE OF RETREAT A SMALL shed had been added to my grandmother's house years ago Some boards were laid across the joists at the top and between these boards and the roof was a very small garret never occupied by any thing but rats and mice It was a pent roof covered with nothing but shingles according to the southern custom for such buildings The garret was only nine feet long and seven wide The highest part was three feet high and sloped down abruptly to the loose board floor There was no admission for either light or air My uncle Philip who was a carpenter had very skillfully made a concealed trap door which communicated with the storeroom He had been doing this while I was waiting in the swamp The storeroom opened upon a piazza To this hole I was conveyed as soon as I entered the house The air was stifling the darkness total A bed had been spread on the floor I could sleep quite comfortably on one side but the slope was so sudden that I could not turn on the other without hitting the roof The rats and mice ran over my bed but I was weary and I slept such sleep as the wretched may when a tempest has passed over them Morning came I knew it only by the noises I heard for in my small den day and night were all the same I suffered for air even more than for light But I was not comfortless I heard the voices of my children There was joy and there was sadness in the sound It made my tears flow How I longed to speak to them I was eager to look on their faces but there was no hole no crack through which I could peep This continued darkness was oppressive It seemed horrible to sit or lie in a cramped position day after day without one gleam of light Yet I would have chosen this rather than my lot as a slave though white people considered it an easy one and it was so compared with the fate of others I was never cruelly over-worked I was never lacerated with the whip from head to foot I was never so beaten and bruised that I could not turn from one side to the other I never had my heel-strings cut to prevent my running away I was never chained to a log and forced to drag it about while I toiled in the fields from morning till night I was never branded with hot iron or torn by bloodhounds On the contrary I had always been kindly treated and tenderly cared for until I came into the hands of Dr Flint I had never wished for freedom till then But though my life in slavery was comparatively devoid of hardships God pity the woman who is compelled to lead such a life My food was passed up to me through the trap-door my uncle had contrived and my grandmother my uncle Phillip and aunt Nancy would seize such opportunities as they could to mount up there and chat with me at the opening But of course this was not safe in the daytime It must all be done in darkness It was impossible for me to move in an erect position but I crawled about my den for exercise One day I hit my head against something and found it was a gimlet My uncle had left it sticking there when he made the trap-door I was as rejoiced as Robinson Crusoe could have been in finding such a treasure It put a lucky thought into my head I said to myself Now I will have some light Now I will see my children I did not dare to begin my work during the daytime for fear of attracting attention But I groped round and having found the side next the street where I could frequently see my children I stuck the gimlet in and waited for evening I bored three rows of holes one above another then I bored out the interstices between I thus succeeded in making one hole about an inch long and an inch broad I sat by it till late into the night to enjoy the little whiff of air that floated in In the morning I watched for my children The first person I saw in the street was Dr Flint I had a shuddering superstitious feeling that it was a bad omen Several familiar faces passed by At last I heard the merry laughing of children and presently two sweet little faces were looking up at me as though they knew I was there and were conscious of the joy they imparted How I longed to tell them I was there My condition was now a little improved But for weeks I was tormented by hundreds of little red insects fine as a needle's point that pierced through my skin and produced an intolerable burning The good grandmother gave me herb teas and cooling medicines and finally I got rid of them The heat of my den was intense for nothing but thin shingles protected me from the scorching summer's sun But I had my consolations Through my peeping-hole I could watch the children and when they were near enough I could hear their talk Aunt Nancy brought me all the news she could hear at Dr Flint's From her I learned that the doctor had written to New York to a colored woman who had been born and raised in our neighborhood and had breathed his contaminating atmosphere He offered her a reward if she could find out any thing about me I know not what was the nature of her reply but he soon after started for New York in haste saying to his family that he had business of importance to transact I peeped at him as he passed on his way to the steamboat It was a satisfaction to have miles of land and water between us even for a little while and it was a still greater satisfaction to know that he believed me to be in the Free States My little den seemed less dreary than it had done He returned as he did from his former journey to New York without obtaining any satisfactory information When he passed our house next morning Benny was standing at the gate He had heard them say that he had gone to find me and he called out Dr Flint did you bring my mother home I want to see her The doctor stamped his foot at him in a rage and exclaimed Get out of the way you little damned rascal If you don't I'll cut off your head Benny ran terrified into the house saying You can't put me in jail again I don't belong to you now It was well that the wind carried the words away from the doctor's ear I told my grandmother of it when we had our next conference at the trap-door and begged of her not to allow the children to be impertinent to the irascible old man Autumn came with a pleasant abatement of heat My eyes had become accustomed to the dim light and by holding my book or work in a certain position near the aperture I contrived to read and sew That was a great relief to the tedious monotony of my life But when winter came the cold penetrated through the thin shingle roof and I was dreadfully chilled The winters there are not so long or so severe as in northern latitudes but the houses are not built to shelter from cold and my little den was peculiarly comfortless The kind grandmother brought me bed-clothes and warm drinks Often I was obliged to lie in bed all day to keep comfortable but with all my precautions my shoulders and feet were frostbitten O those long gloomy days with no object for my eye to rest upon and no thoughts to occupy my mind except the dreary past and the uncertain future I was thankful when there came a day sufficiently mild for me to wrap myself up and sit at the loophole to watch the passers by Southerners have the habit of stopping and talking in the streets and I heard many conversations not intended to meet my ears I heard slave-hunters planning how to catch some poor fugitive Several times I heard allusions to Dr Flint myself and the history of my children who perhaps were playing near the gate One would say I wouldn't move my little finger to catch her as old Flint's property Another would say I'll catch any nigger for the reward A man ought to have what belongs to him if he is a damned brute The opinion was often expressed that I was in the Free States Very rarely did any one suggest that I might be in the vicinity Had the least suspicion rested on my grandmother's house it would have been burned to the ground But it was the last place they thought of Yet there was no place where slavery existed that could have afforded me so good a place of concealment Dr Flint and his family repeatedly tried to coax and bribe my children to tell something they had heard said about me One day the doctor took them into a shop and offered them some bright little silver pieces and gay handkerchiefs if they would tell where their mother was Ellen shrank away from him and would not speak but Benny spoke up and said Dr Flint I don't know where my mother is I guess she's in New York and when you go there again I wish you'd ask her to come home for I want to see her but if you put her in jail or tell her you'll cut her head off I'll tell her to go right back XXII CHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES CHRISTMAS was approaching Grandmother brought me materials and I busied myself making some new garments and little playthings for my children Were it not that hiring day is near at hand and many families are fearfully looking forward to the probability of separation in a few days Christmas might be a happy season for the poor slaves Even slave mothers try to gladden the hearts of their little ones on that occasion Benny and Ellen had their Christmas stockings filled Their imprisoned mother could not have the privilege of witnessing their surprise and joy But I had the pleasure of peeping at them as they went into the street with their new suits on I heard Benny ask a little playmate whether Santa Claus brought him any thing Yes replied the boy but Santa Claus ain't a real man It's the children's mothers that put things into the stockings No that can't be replied Benny for Santa Claus brought Ellen and me these new clothes and my mother has been gone this long time How I longed to tell him that his mother made those garments and that many a tear fell on them while she worked Every child rises early on Christmas morning to see the Johnkannaus Without them Christmas would be shorn of its greatest attraction They consist of companies of slaves from the plantations generally of the lower class Two athletic men in calico wrappers have a net thrown over them covered with all manner of bright-colored stripes Cows' tails are fastened to their backs and their heads are decorated with horns A box covered with sheepskin is called the gumbo box A dozen beat on this while others strike triangles and jawbones to which bands of dancers keep time For a month previous they are composing songs which are sung on this occasion These companies of a hundred each turn out early in the morning and are allowed to go round till twelve o'clock begging for contributions Not a door is left unvisited where there is the least chance of obtaining a penny or a glass of rum They do not drink while they are out but carry the rum home in jugs to have a carousal These Christmas donations frequently amount to twenty or thirty dollars It is seldom that any white man or child refuses to give them a trifle If he does they regale his ears with the following song Poor massa so dey say Down in de heel so dey say Got no money so dey say Not one shillin so dey say God A'mighty bress you so dey say Christmas is a day of feasting both with white and colored people Slaves who are lucky enough to have a few shillings are sure to spend them for good eating and many a turkey and pig is captured without saying By your leave sir Those who cannot obtain these cook a 'possum or a raccoon from which savory dishes can be made My grandmother raised poultry and pigs for sale and it was her established custom to have both a turkey and a pig roasted for Christmas dinner On this occasion I was warned to keep extremely quiet because two guests had been invited One was the town constable and the other was a free colored man who tried to pass himself off for white and who was always ready to do any mean work for the sake of currying favor with white people My grandmother had a motive for inviting them She managed to take them all over the house All the rooms on the lower floor were thrown open for them to pass in and out and after dinner they were invited up stairs to look at a fine mocking bird my uncle had just brought home There too the rooms were all thrown open that they might look in When I heard them talking on the piazza my heart almost stood still I knew this colored man had spent many nights hunting for me Every body knew he had the blood of a slave father in his veins but for the sake of passing himself off for white he was ready to kiss the slaveholders' feet How I despised him As for the constable he wore no false colors The duties of his office were despicable but he was superior to his companion inasmuch as he did not pretend to be what he was not Any white man who could raise money enough to buy a slave would have considered himself degraded by being a constable but the office enabled its possessor to exercise authority If he found any slave out after nine o'clock he could whip him as much as he liked and that was a privilege to be coveted When the guests were ready to depart my grandmother gave each of them some of her nice pudding as a present for their wives Through my peep-hole I saw them go out of the gate and I was glad when it closed after them So passed the first Christmas in my den XXIII STILL IN PRISON WHEN spring returned and I took in the little patch of green the aperture commanded I asked myself how many more summers and winters I must be condemned to spend thus I longed to draw in a plentiful draught of fresh air to stretch my cramped limbs to have room to stand erect to feel the earth under my feet again My relatives were constantly on the lookout for a chance of escape but none offered that seemed practicable and even tolerably safe The hot summer came again and made the turpentine drop from the thin roof over my head During the long nights I was restless for want of air and I had no room to toss and turn There was but one compensation the atmosphere was so stifled that even mosquitos would not condescend to buzz in it With all my detestation of Dr Flint I could hardly wish him a worse punishment either in this world or that which is to come than to suffer what I suffered in one single summer Yet the laws allowed him to be out in the free air while I guiltless of crime was pent up in here as the only means of avoiding the cruelties the laws allowed him to inflict upon me I don't know what kept life within me Again and again I thought I should die before long but I saw the leaves of another autumn whirl through the air and felt the touch of another winter In summer the most terrible thunder storms were acceptable for the rain came through the roof and I rolled up my bed that it might cool the hot boards under it Later in the season storms sometimes wet my clothes through and through and that was not comfortable when the air grew chilly Moderate storms I could keep out by filling the chinks with oakum But uncomfortable as my situation was I had glimpses of things out of doors which made me thankful for my wretched hiding-place One day I saw a slave pass our gate muttering It's his own and he can kill it if he will My grandmother told me that woman's history Her mistress had that day seen her baby for the first time and in the lineaments of its fair face she saw a likeness to her husband She turned the bondwoman and her child out of doors and forbade her ever to return The slave went to her master and told him what had happened He promised to talk with her mistress and make it all right The next day she and her baby were sold to a Georgia trader Another time I saw a woman rush wildly by pursued by two men She was a slave the wet nurse of her mistress's children For some trifling offence her mistress ordered her to be stripped and whipped To escape the degradation and the torture she rushed to the river jumped in and ended her wrongs in death Senator Brown of Mississippi could not be ignorant of many such facts as these for they are of frequent occurrence in every Southern State Yet he stood up in the Congress of the United States and declared that slavery was a great moral social and political blessing a blessing to the master and a blessing to the slave I suffered much more during the second winter than I did during the first My limbs were benumbed by inaction and the cold filled them with cramp I had a very painful sensation of coldness in my head even my face and tongue stiffened and I lost the power of speech Of course it was impossible under the circumstances to summon any physician My brother William came and did all he could for me Uncle Phillip also watched tenderly over me and poor grandmother crept up and down to inquire whether there were any signs of returning life I was restored to consciousness by the dashing of cold water in my face and found myself leaning against my brother's arm while he bent over me with streaming eyes He afterwards told me he thought I was dying for I had been in an unconscious state sixteen hours I next became delirious and was in great danger of betraying myself and my friends To prevent this they stupefied me with drugs I remained in bed six weeks weary in body and sick at heart How to get medical advice was the question William finally went to a Thompsonian doctor and described himself as having all my pains and aches He returned with herbs roots and ointment He was especially charged to rub on the ointment by a fire but how could a fire be made in my little den Charcoal in a furnace was tried but there was no outlet for the gas and it nearly cost me my life Afterwards coals already kindled were brought up in an iron pan and placed on bricks I was so weak and it was so long since I had enjoyed the warmth of a fire that those few coals actually made me weep I think the medicines did me some good but my recovery was very slow Dark thoughts passed through my mind as I lay there day after day I tried to be thankful for my little cell dismal as it was and even to love it as part of the price I had paid for the redemption of my children Sometimes I thought God was a compassionate Father who would forgive my sins for the sake of my sufferings At other times it seemed to me there was no justice or mercy in the divine government I asked why the curse of slavery was permitted to exist and why I had been so persecuted and wronged from youth upward These things took the shape of mystery which is to this day not so clear to my soul as I trust it will be hereafter In the midst of my illness grandmother broke down under the weight of anxiety and toil The idea of losing her who had always been my best friend and a mother to my children was the sorest trial I had yet had O how earnestly I prayed that she might recover How hard it seemed that I could not tend upon her who had so long and so tenderly watched over me One day the screams of a child nerved me with strength to crawl to my peeping-hole and I saw my son covered with blood A fierce dog usually kept chained had seized and bitten him A doctor was sent for and I heard the groans and screams of my child while the wounds were being sewed up O what torture to a mother's heart to listen to this and be unable to go to him But childhood is like a day in spring alternately shower and sunshine Before night Benny was bright and lively threatening the destruction of the dog and great was his delight when the doctor told him the next day that the dog had bitten another boy and been shot Benny recovered from his wounds but it was long before he could walk When my grandmother's illness became known many ladies who were her customers called to bring her some little comforts and to inquire whether she had every thing she wanted Aunt Nancy one night asked permission to watch with her sick mother and Mrs Flint replied I don't see any need of your going I can't spare you But when she found other ladies in the neighborhood were so attentive not wishing to be outdone in Christian charity she also sallied forth in magnificent condescension and stood by the bedside of her who had loved her in her infancy and who had been repaid by such grievous wrongs She seemed surprised to find her so ill and scolded uncle Phillip for not sending for Dr Flint She herself sent for him immediately and he came Secure as I was in my retreat I should have been terrified if I had known he was so near me He pronounced my grandmother in a very critical situation and said if her attending physician wished it he would visit her Nobody wished to have him coming to the house at all hours and we were not disposed to give him a chance to make out a long bill As Mrs Flint went out Sally told her the reason Benny was lame was that a dog had bitten him I'm glad of it she replied I wish he had killed him It would be good news to send to his mother Her day will come The dogs will grab her yet With these Christian words she and her husband departed and to my great satisfaction returned no more I heard from uncle Phillip with feelings of unspeakable joy and gratitude that the crisis was passed and grandmother would live I could now say from my heart God is merciful He has spared me the anguish of feeling that I caused her death XXIV THE CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS THE summer had nearly ended when Dr Flint made a third visit to New York in search of me Two candidates were running for Congress and he returned in season to vote The father of my children was the Whig candidate The doctor had hitherto been a stanch Whig but now he exerted all his energies for the defeat of Mr Sands He invited large parties of men to dine in the shade of his trees and supplied them with plenty of rum and brandy If any poor fellow drowned his wits in the bowl and in the openness of his convivial heart proclaimed that he did not mean to vote the Democratic ticket he was shoved into the street without ceremony The doctor expended his liquor in vain Mr Sands was elected an event which occasioned me some anxious thoughts He had not emancipated my children and if he should die they would be at the mercy of his heirs Two little voices that frequently met my ear pleaded with me not to let their father depart without striving to make their freedom secure Years had passed since I had spoken to him I had not even seen him since the night I passed him unrecognized in my disguise of a sailor I supposed he would call before he left to say something to my grandmother concerning the children and I resolved what course to take The day before his departure for Washington I made arrangements towards evening to get from my hiding-place into the storeroom below I found myself so stiff and clumsy that it was with great difficulty I could hitch from one resting place to another When I reached the storeroom my ankles gave way under me and I sank exhausted on the floor It seemed as if I could never use my limbs again But the purpose I had in view roused all the strength I had I crawled on my hands and knees to the window and screened behind a barrel I waited for his coming The clock struck nine and I knew the steamboat would leave between ten and eleven My hopes were failing But presently I heard his voice saying to some one Wait for me a moment I wish to see aunt Martha When he came out as he passed the window I said Stop one moment and let me speak for my children He started hesitated and then passed on and went out of the gate I closed the shutter I had partially opened and sank down behind the barrel I had suffered much but seldom had I experienced a leaner pang than I then felt Had my children then become of so little consequence to him And had he so little feeling for their wretched mother that he would not listen a moment while she pleaded for them Painful memories were so busy within me that I forgot I had not hooked the shutter till I heard some one opening it I looked up He had come back Who called me said he in a low tone I did I replied Oh Linda said he I knew your voice but I was afraid to answer lest my friend should hear me Why do you come here Is it possible you risk yourself in this house They are mad to allow it I shall expect to hear that you are all ruined I did not wish to implicate him by letting him know my place of concealment so I merely said I thought you would come to bid grandmother good by and so I came here to speak a few words to you about emancipating my children Many changes may take place during the six months you are gone to Washington and it does not seem right for you to expose them to the risk of such changes I want nothing for myself all I ask is that you will free my children or authorize some friend to do it before you go He promised he would do it and also expressed a readiness to make any arrangements whereby I could be purchased I heard footsteps approaching and closed the shutter hastily I wanted to crawl back to my den without letting the family know what I had done for I knew they would deem it very imprudent But he stepped back into the house to tell my grandmother that he had spoken with me at the storeroom window and to beg of her not to allow me to remain in the house over night He said it was the height of madness for me to be there that we should certainly all be ruined Luckily he was in too much of a hurry to wait for a reply or the dear old woman would surely have told him all I tried to go back to my den but found it more difficult to go up than I had to come down Now that my mission was fulfilled the little strength that had supported me through it was gone and I sank helpless on the floor My grandmother alarmed at the risk I had run came into the storeroom in the dark and locked the door behind her Linda she whispered where are you I am here by the window I replied I couldn't have him go away without emancipating the children Who knows what may happen Come come child said she it won't do for you to stay here another minute You've done wrong but I can't blame you poor thing I told her I could not return without assistance and she must call my uncle Uncle Phillip came and pity prevented him from scolding me He carried me back to my dungeon laid me tenderly on the bed gave me some medicine and asked me if there was any thing more he could do Then he went away and I was left with my own thoughtsstarless as the midnight darkness around me My friends feared I should become a cripple for life and I was so weary of my long imprisonment that had it not been for the hope of serving my children I should have been thankful to die but for their sakes I was willing to bear on XXV COMPETITION IN CUNNING DR FLINT had not given me up Every now and then he would say to my grandmother that I would yet come back and voluntarily surrender myself and that when I did I could be purchased by my relatives or any one who wished to buy me I knew his cunning nature too well not to believe that this was a trap laid for me and so all my friends understood it I resolved to match my cunning against his cunning In order to make him believe that I was in New York I resolved to write him a letter dated from that place I sent for my friend Peter and asked him if he knew any trustworthy seafaring person who would carry such a letter to New York and put it in the post office there He said he knew one that he would trust with his own life to the ends of the world I reminded him that it was a hazardous thing for him to undertake He said he knew it but he was willing to do any thing to help me I expressed a wish for a New York paper to ascertain the names of some of the streets He run his hand into his pocket and said Here is half a one that was round a cap I bought of a pedler yesterday I told him the letter would be ready the next evening He bade me good by adding Keep up your spirits Linda brighter days will come by and by My uncle Phillip kept watch over the gate until our brief interview was over Early the next morning I seated myself near the little aperture to examine the newspaper It was a piece of the New York Herald and for once the paper that systematically abuses the colored people was made to render them a service Having obtained what information I wanted concerning streets and numbers I wrote two letters one to my grandmother the other to Dr Flint I reminded him how he a gray-headed man had treated a helpless child who had been placed in his power and what years of misery he had brought upon her To my grandmother I expressed a wish to have my children sent to me at the north where I could teach them to respect themselves and set them a virtuous example which a slave mother was not allowed to do at the south I asked her to direct her answer to a certain street in Boston as I did not live in New York though I went there sometimes I dated these letters ahead to allow for the time it would take to carry them and sent a memorandum of the date to the messenger When my friend came for the letters I said God bless and reward you Peter for this disinterested kindness Pray be careful If you are detected both you and I will have to suffer dreadfully I have not a relative who would dare to do it for me He replied You may trust to me Linda I don't forget that your father was my best friend and I will be a friend to his children so long as God lets me live It was necessary to tell my grandmother what I had done in order that she might be ready for the letter and prepared to hear what Dr Flint might say about my being at the north She was sadly troubled She felt sure mischief would come of it I also told my plan to aunt Nancy in order that she might report to us what was said at Dr Flint's house I whispered it to her through a crack and she whispered back I hope it will succeed I shan't mind being a slave all my life if I can only see you and the children free I had directed that my letters should be put into the New York post office on the th of the month On that evening of the th my aunt came to say that Dr Flint and his wife had been talking in a low voice about a letter he had received and that when he went to his office he promised to bring it when he came to tea So I concluded I should hear my letter read the next morning I told my grandmother Dr Flint would be sure to come and asked her to have him sit near a certain door and leave it open that I might hear what he said The next morning I took my station within sound of that door and remained motionless as a statue It was not long before I heard the gate slam and the well-known footsteps enter the house He seated himself in the chair that was placed for him and said Well Martha I've brought you a letter from Linda She has sent me a letter also I know exactly where to find her but I don't choose to go to Boston for her I had rather she would come back of her own accord in a respectable manner Her uncle Phillip is the best person to go for her With him she would feel perfectly free to act I am willing to pay his expenses going and returning She shall be sold to her friends Her children are free at least I suppose they are and when you obtain her freedom you'll make a happy family I suppose Martha you have no objection to my reading to you the letter Linda has written to you He broke the seal and I heard him read it The old villian He had suppressed the letter I wrote to grandmother and prepared a substitute of his own the purport of which was as follows Dear Grandmother I have long wanted to write to you but the disgraceful manner in which I left you and my children made me ashamed to do it If you knew how much I have suffered since I ran away you would pity and forgive me I have purchased freedom at a dear rate If any arrangement could be made for me to return to the south without being a slave I would gladly come If not I beg of you to send my children to the north I cannot live any longer without them Let me know in time and I will meet them in New York or Philadelphia whichever place best suits my uncle's convenience Write as soon as possible to your unhappy daughter LINDA It is very much as I expected it would be said the old hypocrite rising to go You see the foolish girl has repented of her rashness and wants to return We must help her to do it Martha Talk with Phillip about it If he will go for her she will trust to him and come back I should like an answer tomorrow Good morning Martha As he stepped out on the piazza he stumbled over my little girl Ah Ellen is that you he said in his most gracious manner I didn't see you How do you do Pretty well sir she replied I heard you tell grandmother that my mother is coming home I want to see her Yes Ellen I am going to bring her home very soon rejoiced he and you shall see her as much as you like you little curly-headed nigger This was as good as a comedy to me who had heard it all but grandmother was frightened and distressed because the doctor wanted my uncle to go for me The next evening Dr Flint called to talk the matter over My uncle told him that from what he had heard of Massachusetts he judged he should be mobbed if he went there after a runaway slave All stuff and nonsense Phillip replied the doctor Do you suppose I want you to kick up a row in Boston The business can all be done quietly Linda writes that she wants to come back You are her relative and she would trust you The case would be different if I went She might object to coming with me and the damned abolitionists if they knew I was her master would not believe me if I told them she had begged to go back They would get up a row and I should not like to see Linda dragged through the streets like a common negro She has been very ungrateful to me for all my kindness but I forgive her and want to act the part of a friend towards her I have no wish to hold her as my slave Her friends can buy her as soon as she arrives here Finding that his arguments failed to convince my uncle the doctor let the cat out of the bag by saying that he had written to the mayor of Boston to ascertain whether there was a person of my description at the street and number from which my letter was dated He had omitted this date in the letter he had made up to read to my grandmother If I had dated from New York the old man would probably have made another journey to that city But even in that dark region where knowledge is so carefully excluded from the slave I had heard enough about Massachusetts to come to the conclusion that slaveholders did not consider it a comfortable place to go to in search of a runaway That was before the Fugitive Slave Law was passed before Massachusetts had consented to become a nigger hunter for the south My grandmother who had become skittish by seeing her family always in danger came to me with a very distressed countenance and said What will you do if the mayor of Boston sends him word that you haven't been there Then he will suspect the letter was a trick and maybe he'll find out something about it and we shall all get into trouble O Linda I wish you had never sent the letters Don't worry yourself grandmother said I The mayor of Boston won't trouble himself to hunt niggers for Dr Flint The letters will do good in the end I shall get out of this dark hole some time or other I hope you will child replied the good patient old friend You have been here a long time almost five years but whenever you do go it will break your old grandmother's heart I should be expecting every day to hear that you were brought back in irons and put in jail God help you poor child Let us be thankful that some time or other we shall go where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest My heart responded Amen The fact that Dr Flint had written to the mayor of Boston convinced me that he believed my letter to be genuine and of course that he had no suspicion of my being any where in the vicinity It was a great object to keep up this delusion for it made me and my friends feel less anxious and it would be very convenient whenever there was a chance to escape I resolved therefore to continue to write letters from the north from time to time Two or three weeks passed and as no news came from the mayor of Boston grandmother began to listen to my entreaty to be allowed to leave my cell sometimes and exercise my limbs to prevent my becoming a cripple I was allowed to slip down into the small storeroom early in the morning and remain there a little while The room was all filled up with barrels except a small open space under my trap-door This faced the door the upper part of which was of glass and purposely left uncurtained that the curious might look in The air of this place was close but it was so much better than the atmosphere of my cell that I dreaded to return I came down as soon as it was light and remained till eight o'clock when people began to be about and there was danger that some one might come on the piazza I had tried various applications to bring warmth and feeling into my limbs but without avail They were so numb and stiff that it was a painful effort to move and had my enemies come upon me during the first mornings I tried to exercise them a little in the small unoccupied space of the storeroom it would have been impossible for me to have escaped XXVI IMPORTANT ERA IN MY BROTHER'S LIFE I MISSED the company and kind attentions of my brother William who had gone to Washington with his master Mr Sands We received several letters from him written without any allusion to me but expressed in such a manner that I knew he did not forget me I disguised my hand and wrote to him in the same manner It was a long session and when it closed William wrote to inform us that Mr Sands was going to the north to be gone some time and that he was to accompany him I knew that his master had promised to give him his freedom but no time had been specified Would William trust to a slave's chances I remembered how we used to talk together in our young days about obtaining our freedom and I thought it very doubtful whether he would come back to us Grandmother received a letter from Mr Sands saying that William had proved a most faithful servant and he would also say a valued friend that no mother had ever trained a better boy He said he had travelled through the Northern States and Canada and though the abolitionists had tried to decoy him away they had never succeeded He ended by saying they should be at home shortly We expected letters from William describing the novelties of his journey but none came In time it was reported that Mr Sands would return late in the autumn accompanied by a bride Still no letters from William I felt almost sure I should never see him again on southern soil but had he no word of comfort to send to his friends at home to the poor captive in her dungeon My thoughts wandered through the dark past and over the uncertain future Alone in my cell where no eye but God's could see me I wept bitter tears How earnestly I prayed to him to restore me to my children and enable me to be a useful woman and a good mother At last the day arrived for the return of the travellers Grandmother had made loving preparations to welcome her absent boy back to the old hearthstone When the dinner table was laid William's plate occupied its old place The stage coach went by empty My grandmother waited dinner She thought perhaps he was necessarily detained by his master In my prison I listened anxiously expecting every moment to hear my dear brother's voice and step In the course of the afternoon a lad was sent by Mr Sands to tell grandmother that William did not return with him that the abolitionists had decoyed him away But he begged her not to feel troubled about it for he felt confident she would see William in a few days As soon as he had time to reflect he would come back for he could never expect to be so well off at the north as he had been with him If you had seen the tears and heard the sobs you would have thought the messenger had brought tidings of death instead of freedom Poor old grandmother felt that she should never see her darling boy again And I was selfish I thought more of what I had lost than of what my brother had gained A new anxiety began to trouble me Mr Sands had expended a good deal of money and would naturally feel irritated by the loss he had incurred I greatly feared this might injure the prospects of my children who were now becoming valuable property I longed to have their emancipation made certain The more so because their master and father was now married I was too familiar with slavery not to know that promises made to slaves though with kind intentions and sincere at the time depend upon many contingencies for their fulfillment Much as I wished William to be free the step he had taken made me sad and anxious The following Sabbath was calm and clear so beautiful that it seemed like a Sabbath in the eternal world My grandmother brought the children out on the piazza that I might hear their voices She thought it would comfort me in my despondency and it did They chatted merrily as only children can Benny said Grandmother do you think uncle Will has gone for good Won't he ever come back again May be he'll find mother If he does won't she be glad to see him Why don't you and uncle Phillip and all of us go and live where mother is I should like it wouldn't you Ellen Yes I should like it replied Ellen but how could we find her Do you know the place grandmother I don't remember how mother lookeddo you Benny Benny was just beginning to describe me when they were interrupted by an old slave woman a near neighbor named Aggie This poor creature had witnessed the sale of her children and seen them carried off to parts unknown without any hopes of ever hearing from them again She saw that my grandmother had been weeping and she said in a sympathizing tone What's the matter aunt Marthy O Aggie she replied it seems as if I shouldn't have any of my children or grandchildren left to hand me a drink when I'm dying and lay my old body in the ground My boy didn't come back with Mr Sands He staid at the north Poor old Aggie clapped her hands for joy Is dat what you's crying fur she exclaimed Git down on your knees and bress de Lord I don't know whar my poor chillern is and I nebber 'spect to know You don't know whar poor Linda's gone to but you do know whar her brudder is He's in free parts and dat's de right place Don't murmur at de Lord's doings but git down on your knees and tank him for his goodness My selfishness was rebuked by what poor Aggie said She rejoiced over the escape of one who was merely her fellow-bondman while his own sister was only thinking what his good fortune might cost her children I knelt and prayed God to forgive me and I thanked him from my heart that one of my family was saved from the grasp of slavery It was not long before we received a letter from William He wrote that Mr Sands had always treated him kindly and that he had tried to do his duty to him faithfully But ever since he was a boy he had longed to be free and he had already gone through enough to convince him he had better not lose the chance that offered He concluded by saying Don't worry about me dear grandmother I shall think of you always and it will spur me on to work hard and try to do right When I have earned money enough to give you a home perhaps you will come to the north and we can all live happy together Mr Sands told my uncle Phillip the particulars about William's leaving him He said I trusted him as if he were my own brother and treated him as kindly The abolitionists talked to him in several places but I had no idea they could tempt him However I don't blame William He's young and inconsiderate and those Northern rascals decoyed him I must confess the scamp was very bold about it I met him coming down the steps of the Astor House with his trunk on his shoulder and I asked him where he was going He said he was going to change his old trunk I told him it was rather shabby and asked if he didn't need some money He said No thanked me and went off He did not return so soon as I expected but I waited patiently At last I went to see if our trunks were packed ready for our journey I found them locked and a sealed note on the table informed me where I could find the keys The fellow even tried to be religious He wrote that he hoped God would always bless me and reward me for my kindness that he was not unwilling to serve me but he wanted to be a free man and that if I thought he did wrong he hoped I would forgive him I intended to give him his freedom in five years He might have trusted me He has shown himself ungrateful but I shall not go for him or send for him I feel confident that he will soon return to me I afterwards heard an account of the affair from William himself He had not been urged away by abolitionists He needed no information they could give him about slavery to stimulate his desire for freedom He looked at his hands and remembered that they were once in irons What security had he that they would not be so again Mr Sands was kind to him but he might indefinitely postpone the promise he had made to give him his freedom He might come under pecuniary embarrassments and his property be seized by creditors or he might die without making any arrangements in his favor He had too often known such accidents to happen to slaves who had kind masters and he wisely resolved to make sure of the present opportunity to own himself He was scrupulous about taking any money from his master on false pretences so he sold his best clothes to pay for his passage to Boston The slaveholders pronounced him a base ungrateful wretch for thus requiting his master's indulgence What would they have done under similar circumstances When Dr Flint's family heard that William had deserted Mr Sands they chuckled greatly over the news Mrs Flint made her usual manifestations of Christian feeling by saying I'm glad of it I hope he'll never get him again I like to see people paid back in their own coin I reckon Linda's children will have to pay for it I should be glad to see them in the speculator's hands again for I'm tired of seeing those little niggers march about the streets XXVII NEW DESTINATION FOR THE CHILDREN MRS FLINT proclaimed her intention of informing Mrs Sands who was the father of my children She likewise proposed to tell her what an artful devil I was that I had made a great deal of trouble in her family that when Mr Sands was at the north she didn't doubt I had followed him in disguise and persuaded William to run away She had some reason to entertain such an idea for I had written from the north from time to time and I dated my letters from various places Many of them fell into Dr Flint's hands as I expected they would and he must have come to the conclusion that I travelled about a good deal He kept a close watch over my children thinking they would eventually lead to my detection A new and unexpected trial was in store for me One day when Mr Sands and his wife were walking in the street they met Benny The lady took a fancy to him and exclaimed What a pretty little negro Whom does he belong to Benny did not hear the answer but he came home very indignant with the stranger lady because she had called him a negro A few days afterwards Mr Sands called on my grandmother and told her he wanted her to take the children to his house He said he had informed his wife of his relation to them and told her they were motherless and she wanted to see them When he had gone my grandmother came and asked what I would do The question seemed a mockery What could I do They were Mr Sands's slaves and their mother was a slave whom he had represented to be dead Perhaps he thought I was I was too much pained and puzzled to come to any decision and the children were carried without my knowledge Mrs Sands had a sister from Illinois staying with her This lady who had no children of her own was so much pleased with Ellen that she offered to adopt her and bring her up as she would a daughter Mrs Sands wanted to take Benjamin When grandmother reported this to me I was tried almost beyond endurance Was this all I was to gain by what I had suffered for the sake of having my children free True the prospect seemed fair but I knew too well how lightly slaveholders held such parental relations If pecuniary troubles should come or if the new wife required more money than could conveniently be spared my children might be thought of as a convenient means of raising funds I had no trust in thee O Slavery Never should I know peace till my children were emancipated with all due formalities of law I was too proud to ask Mr Sands to do any thing for my own benefit but I could bring myself to become a supplicant for my children I resolved to remind him of the promise he had made me and to throw myself upon his honor for the performance of it I persuaded my grandmother to go to him and tell him I was not dead and that I earnestly entreated him to keep the promise he had made me that I had heard of the recent proposals concerning my children and did not feel easy to accept them that he had promised to emancipate them and it was time for him to redeem his pledge I know there was some risk in thus betraying that I was in the vicinity but what will not a mother do for her children He received the message with surprise and said The children are free I have never intended to claim them as slaves Linda may decide their fate In my opinion they had better be sent to the north I don't think they are quite safe here Dr Flint boasts that they are still in his power He says they were his daughter's property and as she was not of age when they were sold the contract is not legally binding So then after all I had endured for their sakes my poor children were between two fires between my old master and their new master And I was powerless There was no protecting arm of the law for me to invoke Mr Sands proposed that Ellen should go for the present to some of his relatives who had removed to Brooklyn Long Island It was promised that she should be well taken care of and sent to school I consented to it as the best arrangement I could make for her My grandmother of course negotiated it all and Mrs Sands knew of no other person in the transaction She proposed that they should take Ellen with them to Washington and keep her till they had a good chance of sending her with friends to Brooklyn She had an infant daughter I had a glimpse of it as the nurse passed with it in her arms It was not a pleasant thought to me that the bondwoman's child should tend her free-born sister but there was no alternative Ellen was made ready for the journey O how it tried my heart to send her away so young alone among strangers Without a mother's love to shelter her from the storms of life almost without memory of a mother I doubted whether she and Benny would have for me the natural affection that children feel for a parent I thought to myself that I might perhaps never see my daughter again and I had a great desire that she should look upon me before she went that she might take my image with her in her memory It seemed to me cruel to have her brought to my dungeon It was sorrow enough for her young heart to know that her mother was a victim of slavery without seeing the wretched hiding place to which it had driven her I begged permission to pass the last night in one of the open chambers with my little girl They thought I was crazy to think of trusting such a young child with my perilous secret I told them I had watched her character and I felt sure she would not betray me that I was determined to have an interview and if they would not facilitate it I would take my own way to obtain it They remonstrated against the rashness of such a proceeding but finding they could not change my purpose they yielded I slipped through the trap-door into the storeroom and my uncle kept watch at the gate while I passed into the piazza and went up stairs to the room I used to occupy It was more than five years since I had seen it and how the memories crowded on me There I had taken shelter when my mistress drove me from her house there came my old tyrant to mock insult and curse me there my children were first laid in my arms there I had watched over them each day with a deeper and sadder love there I had knelt to God in anguish of heart to forgive the wrong I had done How vividly it all came back And after this long gloomy interval I stood there such a wreck In the midst of these meditations I heard footsteps on the stairs The door opened and my uncle Phillip came in leading Ellen by the hand I put my arms round her and said Ellen my dear child I am your mother She drew back a little and looked at me then with sweet confidence she laid her cheek against mine and I folded her to the heart that had been so long desolated She was the first to speak Raising her head she said inquiringly You really are my mother I told her I really was that during all the long time she had not seen me I had loved her most tenderly and that now she was going away I wanted to see her and talk with her that she might remember me With a sob in her voice she said I'm glad you've come to see me but why didn't you ever come before Benny and I have wanted so much to see you He remembers you and sometimes he tells me about you Why didn't you come home when Dr Flint went to bring you I answered I couldn't come before dear But now that I am with you tell me whether you like to go away I don't know said she crying Grandmother says I ought not to cry that I am going to a good place where I can learn to read and write and that by and by I can write her a letter But I shan't have Benny or grandmother or uncle Phillip or any body to love me Can't you go with me O do go dear mother I told her I couldn't go now but sometime I would come to her and then she and Benny and I would live together and have happy times She wanted to run and bring Benny to see me now I told her he was going to the north before long with uncle Phillip and then I would come to see him before he went away I asked if she would like to have me stay all night and sleep with her O yes she replied Then turning to her uncle she said pleadingly May I stay Please uncle She is my own mother He laid his hand on her head and said solemnly Ellen this is the secret you have promised grandmother never to tell If you ever speak of it to any body they will never let you see your grandmother again and your mother can never come to Brooklyn Uncle she replied I will never tell He told her she might stay with me and when he had gone I took her in my arms and told her I was a slave and that was the reason she must never say she had seen me I exhorted her to be a good child to try to please the people where she was going and that God would raise her up friends I told her to say her prayers and remember always to pray for her poor mother and that God would permit us to meet again She wept and I did not check her tears Perhaps she would never again have a chance to pour her tears into a mother's bosom All night she nestled in my arms and I had no inclination to slumber The moments were too precious to lose any of them Once when I thought she was asleep I kissed her forehead softly and she said I am not asleep dear mother Before dawn they came to take me back to my den I drew aside the window curtain to take a last look of my child The moonlight shone on her face and I bent over her as I had done years before that wretched night when I ran away I hugged her close to my throbbing heart and tears too sad for such young eyes to shed flowed down her cheeks as she gave her last kiss and whispered in my ear Mother I will never tell And she never did When I got back to my den I threw myself on the bed and wept there alone in the darkness It seemed as if my heart would burst When the time for Ellen's departure drew nigh I could hear neighbors and friends saying to her Good by Ellen I hope your poor mother will find you out Won't you be glad to see her She replied Yes ma'am and they little dreamed of the weighty secret that weighed down her young heart She was an affectionate child but naturally very reserved except with those she loved and I felt secure that my secret would be safe with her I heard the gate close after her with such feelings as only a slave mother can experience During the day my meditations were very sad Sometimes I feared I had been very selfish not to give up all claim to her and let her go to Illinois to be adopted by Mrs Sands's sister It was my experience of slavery that decided me against it I feared that circumstances might arise that would cause her to be sent back I felt confident that I should go to New York myself and then I should be able to watch over her and in some degree protect her Dr Flint's family knew nothing of the proposed arrangement till after Ellen was gone and the news displeased them greatly Mrs Flint called on Mrs Sands's sister to inquire into the matter She expressed her opinion very freely as to the respect Mr Sands's showed for his wife and for his own character in acknowledging those young niggers And as for sending Ellen away she pronounced it to be just as much stealing as it would be for him to come and take a piece of furniture out of her parlor She said her daughter was not of age to sign the bill of sale and the children were her property and when she became of age or was married she could take them wherever she could lay hands on them Miss Emily Flint the little girl to whom I had been bequeathed was now in her sixteenth year Her mother considered it all right and honorable for her or her future husband to steal my children but she did not understand how any body could hold up their heads in respectable society after they had purchased their own children as Mr Sands had done Dr Flint said very little Perhaps he thought that Benny would be less likely to be sent away if he kept quiet One of my letters that fell into his hands was dated from Canada and he seldom spoke of me now This state of things enabled me to slip down into the storeroom more frequently where I could stand upright and move my limbs more freely Days weeks and months passed and there came no news of Ellen I sent a letter to Brooklyn written in my grandmother's name to inquire whether she had arrived there Answer was returned that she had not I wrote to her in Washington but no notice was taken of it There was one person there who ought to have had some sympathy with the anxiety of the child's friends at home but the links of such relations as he had formed with me are easily broken and cast away as rubbish Yet how protectively and persuasively he once talked to the poor helpless slave girl And how entirely I trusted him But now suspicions darkened my mind Was my child dead or had they deceived me and sold her If the secret memoirs of many members of Congress should be published curious details would be unfolded I once saw a letter from a member of Congress to a slave who was the mother of six of his children He wrote to request that she would send her children away from the great house before his return as he expected to be accompanied by friends The woman could not read and was obliged to employ another to read the letter The existence of the colored children did not trouble this gentleman it was only the fear that friends might recognize in their features a resemblance to him At the end of six months a letter came to my grandmother from Brooklyn It was written by a young lady in the family and announced that Ellen had just arrived It contained the following message from her I do try to do just as you told me to and I pray for you every night and morning I understood that these words were meant for me and they were a balsam to my heart The writer closed her letter by saying Ellen is a nice girl and we shall like to have to have her with us My cousin Mr Sands has given her to me to be my little waiting maid I shall send her to school and I hope some day she will write to you herself This letter perplexed and troubled me Had my child's father merely placed her there till she was old enough to support herself Or had he given her to his cousin as a piece of property If the last idea was correct his cousin might return to the south at any time and hold Ellen as a slave I tried to put away from me the painful thought that such a foul wrong could have been done to us I said to myself Surely there must be some justice in man then I remembered with a sigh how slavery perverted all the natural feelings of the human heart It gave me a pang to look on my light-hearted boy He believed himself free and to have him brought under the yoke of slavery would be more than I could bear How I longed to have him safely out of the reach of its power XXVIII AUNT NANCY I HAVE mentioned my great-aunt who was a slave in Dr Flint's family and who had been my refuge during the shameful persecutions I suffered from him This aunt had been married at twenty years of age that is as far as slaves can marry She had the consent of her master and mistress and a clergyman performed the ceremony But it was a mere form without any legal value Her master or mistress could annul it any day they pleased She had always slept on the floor in the entry near Mrs Flint's chamber door that she might be within call When she was married she was told that she might have the use of a small room in an outhouse Her mother and her husband furnished it He was a seafaring man and was allowed to sleep there when he was at home But on the wedding evening the bride was ordered to her old post on the entry floor Mrs Flint at that time had no children but she was expecting to be a mother and if she should want a drink of water in the night what could she do without her slave to bring it So my aunt was compelled to lie at her door until one midnight she was forced to leave to give premature birth to a child In a fortnight she was required to resume her place on the entry floor because Mrs Flint's babe needed her attentions She kept her station there through the summer and winter until she had given premature birth to six children and all the while she was employed as night-nurse to Mr Flint's children Finally toiling all day and being deprived of rest at night completely broke down her constitution and Dr Flint declared it was impossible she could ever become the mother of a living child The fear of losing so valuable a servant by death now induced them to allow her to sleep in her little room in the out-house except when there was sickness in the family She afterwards had two feeble babes one of whom died in a few days and the other in four weeks I well remember her patient sorrow as she held the last dead baby in her arms I wish it could have lived she said it is not the will of God that any of my children should live But I will try to be fit to meet their little spirits in heaven Aunt Nancy was housekeeper and waiting-maid in Dr Flint's family Indeed she was the factotum of the household Nothing went on well without her She was my mother's twin sister and as far as was in her power she supplied a mother's place to us orphans I slept with her all the time I lived in my old master's house and the bond between us was very strong When my friends tried to discourage me from running away she always encouraged me When they thought I had better return and ask my master's pardon because there was no possibility of escape she sent me word never to yield She said if I persevered I might perhaps gain the freedom of my children and even if I perished in doing it that was better than to leave them to groan under the same persecutions that had blighted my own life After I was shut up in my dark cell she stole away whenever she could to bring me the news and say something cheering How often did I kneel down to listen to her words of consolation whispered through a crack I am old and have not long to live she used to say and I could die happy if I could only see you and the children free You must pray to God Linda as I do for you that he will lead you out of this darkness I would beg her not to worry herself on my account that there was an end of all the suffering sooner or later and that whether I lived in chains or in freedom I should always remember her as the good friend who had been the comfort of my life A word from her always strengthened me and not me only The whole family relied upon her judgment and were guided by her advice I had been in my cell six years when my grandmother was summoned to the bedside of this her last remaining daughter She was very ill and they said she would die Grandmother had not entered Dr Flint's house for several years They had treated her cruelly but she thought nothing of that now She was grateful for permission to watch by the death-bed of her child They had always been devoted to each other and now they sat looking into each other's eyes longing to speak of the secret that had weighed so much on them both My aunt had been stricken with paralysis She lived two days and the last day she was speechless Before she lost the power of utterance she told her mother not to grieve if she could not speak to her that she would try to hold up her hand to let her know that all was well with her Even the hard-heartened doctor was a little softened when he saw the dying woman try to smile on the aged mother who was kneeling by her side His eyes moistened for a moment as he said she had always been a faithful servant and they should never be able to supply her place Mrs Flint took to her bed quite overcome by the shock While my grandmother sat alone with the dead the doctor came in leading his youngest son who had always been a great pet with aunt Nancy and was much attached to her Martha said he aunt Nancy loved this child and when he comes where you are I hope you will be kind to him for her sake She replied Your wife was my foster-child Dr Flint the foster-sister of my poor Nancy and you little know me if you think I can feel any thing but good will for her children I wish the past could be forgotten and that we might never think of it said he and that Linda would come to supply her aunt's place She would be worth more to us than all the money that could be paid for her I wish it for your sake also Martha Now that Nancy is taken away from you she would be a great comfort to your old age He knew he was touching a tender chord Almost choking with grief my grandmother replied It was not I that drove Linda away My grandchildren are gone and of my nine children only one is left God help me To me the death of this kind relative was an inexpressible sorrow I knew that she had been slowly murdered and I felt that my troubles had helped to finish the work After I heard of her illness I listened constantly to hear what news was brought from the great house and the thought that I could not go to her made me utterly miserable At last as uncle Phillip came into the house I heard some one inquire How is she and he answered She is dead My little cell seemed whirling round and I knew nothing more till I opened my eyes and found uncle Phillip bending over me I had no need to ask any questions He whispered Linda she died happy I could not weep My fixed gaze troubled him Don't look so he said Don't add to my poor mother's trouble Remember how much she has to bear and that we ought to do all we can to comfort her Ah yes that blessed old grandmother who for seventy-three years had borne the pelting storms of a slave-mother's life She did indeed need consolation Mrs Flint had rendered her poor foster-sister childless apparently without any compunction and with cruel selfishness had ruined her health by years of incessant unrequited toil and broken rest But now she became very sentimental I suppose she thought it would be a beautiful illustration of the attachment existing between slaveholder and slave if the body of her old worn-out servant was buried at her feet She sent for the clergyman and asked if he had any objection to burying aunt Nancy in the doctor's family burial place No colored person had ever been allowed interment in the white people's burying-ground and the minister knew that all the deceased of our family reposed together in the old graveyard of the slaves He therefore replied I have no objection to complying with your wish but perhaps aunt Nancy's mother may have some choice as to where her remains shall be deposited It had never occurred to Mrs Flint that slaves could have any feelings When my grandmother was consulted she at once said she wanted Nancy to lie with all the rest of her family and where her own old body would be buried Mrs Flint graciously complied with her wish though she said it was painful to her to have Nancy buried away from her She might have added with touching pathos I was so long used to sleep with her lying near me on the entry floor My uncle Phillip asked permission to bury his sister at his own expense and slaveholders are always ready to grant such favors to slaves and their relatives The arrangements were very plain but perfectly respectable She was buried on the Sabbath and Mrs Flint's minister read the funeral service There was a large concourse of colored people bond and free and a few white persons who had always been friendly to our family Dr Flint's carriage was in the procession and when the body was deposited in its humble resting place the mistress dropped a tear and returned to her carriage probably thinking she had performed her duty nobly It was talked of by the slaves as a mighty grand funeral Northern travellers passing through the place might have described this tribute of respect to the humble dead as a beautiful feature in the patriarchal institution a touching proof of the attachment between slaveholders and their servants and tender-hearted Mrs Flint would have confirmed this impression with handkerchief at her eyes We could have told them a different story We could have given them a of wrongs and sufferings that would have touched their hearts if they had any hearts to feel for the colored people We could have told them how the poor old slave-mother had toiled year after year to earn eight hundred dollars to buy her son Phillip's right to his own earnings and how that same Phillip paid the expenses of the funeral which they regarded as doing so much credit to the master We could also have told them of a poor blighted young creature shut up in a living grave for years to avoid the tortures that would be inflicted on her if she ventured to come out and look on the face of her departed friend All this and much more I thought of as I sat at my loophole waiting for the family to return from the grave sometimes weeping sometimes falling asleep dreaming strange dreams of the dead and the living It was sad to witness the grief of my bereaved grandmother She had always been strong to bear and now as ever religious faith supported her But her dark life had become still darker and age and trouble were leaving deep traces on her withered face She had four places to knock for me to come to the trap-door and each place had a different meaning She now came oftener than she had done and talked to me of her dead daughter while tears trickled slowly down her furrowed cheeks I said all I could to comfort her but it was a sad reflection that instead of being able to help her I was a constant source of anxiety and trouble The poor old back was fitted to its burden It bent under it but did not break XXIX PREPARATIONS FOR ESCAPE I HARDLY expect that the reader will credit me when I affirm that I lived in that little dismal hole almost deprived of light and air and with no space to move my limbs for nearly seven years But it is a fact and to me a sad one even now for my body still suffers from the effects of that long imprisonment to say nothing of my soul Members of my family now living in New York and Boston can testify to the truth of what I say Countless were the nights that I sat late at the little loophole scarcely large enough to give me a glimpse of one twinkling star There I heard the patrols and slave-hunters conferring together about the capture of runaways well knowing how rejoiced they would be to catch me Season after season year after year I peeped at my children's faces and heard their sweet voices with a heart yearning all the while to say Your mother is here Sometimes it appeared to me as if ages had rolled away since I entered upon that gloomy monotonous existence At times I was stupefied and listless at other times I became very impatient to know when these dark years would end and I should again be allowed to feel the sunshine and breathe the pure air After Ellen left us this feeling increased Mr Sands had agreed that Benny might go to the north whenever his uncle Phillip could go with him and I was anxious to be there also to watch over my children and protect them so far as I was able Moreover I was likely to be drowned out of my den if I remained much longer for the slight roof was getting badly out of repair and uncle Phillip was afraid to remove the shingles lest some one should get a glimpse of me When storms occurred in the night they spread mats and bits of carpet which in the morning appeared have been laid out to dry but to cover the roof in the daytime might have attracted attention Consequently my clothes and bedding were often drenched a process by which the pains and aches in my cramped and stiffened limbs were greatly increased I revolved various plans of escape in my mind which I sometimes imparted to my grandmother when she came to whisper with me at the trap-door The kind-hearted old woman had an intense sympathy for runaways She had known too much of the cruelties inflicted on those who were captured Her memory always flew back at once to the sufferings of her bright and handsome son Benjamin the youngest and dearest of her flock So whenever I alluded to the subject she would groan out O don't think of it child You'll break my heart I had no good old aunt Nancy now to encourage me but my brother William and my children were continually beckoning me to the north And now I must go back a few months in my story I have stated that the first of January was the time for selling slaves or leasing them out to new masters If time were counted by heart-throbs the poor slaves might reckon years of suffering during that festival so joyous to the free On the New Year's day preceding my aunt's death one of my friends named Fanny was to be sold at auction to pay her master's debts My thoughts were with her during all the day and at night I anxiously inquired what had been her fate I was told that she had been sold to one master and her four little girls to another master far distant that she had escaped from her purchaser and was not to be found Her mother was the old Aggie I have spoken of She lived in a small tenement belonging to my grandmother and built on the same lot with her own house Her dwelling was searched and watched and that brought the patrols so near me that I was obliged to keep very close in my den The hunters were somehow eluded and not long afterwards Benny accidentally caught sight of Fanny in her mother's hut He told his grandmother who charged him never to speak of it explaining to him the frightful consequences and he never betrayed the trust Aggie little dreamed that my grandmother knew where her daughter was concealed and that the stooping form of her old neighbor was bending under a similar burden of anxiety and fear but these dangerous secrets deepened the sympathy between the two old persecuted mothers My friend Fanny and I remained many weeks hidden within call of each other but she was unconscious of the fact I longed to have her share my den which seemed a more secure retreat than her own but I had brought so much trouble on my grandmother that it seemed wrong to ask her to incur greater risks My restlessness increased I had lived too long in bodily pain and anguish of spirit Always I was in dread that by some accident or some contrivance slavery would succeed in snatching my children from me This thought drove me nearly frantic and I determined to steer for the North Star at all hazards At this crisis Providence opened an unexpected way for me to escape My friend Peter came one evening and asked to speak with me Your day has come Linda said he I have found a chance for you to go to the Free States You have a fortnight to decide The news seemed too good to be true but Peter explained his arrangements and told me all that was necessary was for me to say I would go I was going to answer him with a joyful yes when the thought of Benny came to my mind I told him the temptation was exceedingly strong but I was terribly afraid of Dr Flint's alleged power over my child and that I could not go and leave him behind Peter remonstrated earnestly He said such a good chance might never occur again that Benny was free and could be sent to me and that for the sake of my children's welfare I ought not to hesitate a moment I told him I would consult with uncle Phillip My uncle rejoiced in the plan and bade me to go by all means He promised if his life was spared that he would either bring or send my son to me as soon as I reached a place of safety I resolved to go but thought nothing had better be said to my grandmother till very near the time of departure But my uncle thought she would feel it more keenly if I left her so suddenly I will reason with her said he and convince her how necessary it is not only for your sake but for hers also You cannot be blind to the fact that she is sinking under her burdens I was not blind to it I knew that my concealment was an ever-present source of anxiety and that the older she grew the more nervously fearful she was of discovery My uncle talked with her and finally succeeded in persuading her that it was absolutely necessary for me to seize the chance so unexpectedly offered The anticipation of being a free woman proved almost too much for my weak frame The excitement stimulated me and at the same time bewildered me I made busy preparations for my journey and for my son to follow me I resolved to have an interview with him before I went that I might give him cautions and advice and tell him how anxiously I should be waiting for him at the north Grandmother stole up to me as often as possible to whisper words of counsel She insisted upon my writing to Dr Flint as soon as I arrived in the Free States and asking him to sell me to her She said she would sacrifice her house and all she had in the world for the sake of having me safe with my children in any part of the world If she could only live to know that she could die in peace I promised the dear old faithful friend that I would write to her as soon as I arrived and put the letter in a safe way to reach her but in my own mind I resolved that not another cent of her hard earnings should be spent to pay rapacious slaveholders for what they called their property And even if I had not been unwilling to buy what I had already a right to possess common humanity would have prevented me from accepting the generous offer at the expense of turning my aged relative out of house and home when she was trembling on the brink of the grave I was to escape in a vessel but I forbear to mention any further particulars I was in readiness but the vessel was unexpectedly detained several days Meantime news came to town of a most horrible murder committed on a fugitive slave named James Charity the mother of this unfortunate young man had been an old acquaintance of ours I have told the shocking particulars of his death in my description of some of the neighboring slaveholders My grandmother always nervously sensitive about runaways was terribly frightened She felt sure that a similar fate awaited me if I did not desist from my enterprise She sobbed and groaned and entreated me not to go Her excessive fear was somewhat contagious and my heart was not proof against her extreme agony I was grievously disappointed but I promised to relinquish my project When my friend Peter was apprised of this he was disappointed and vexed He said that judging from our past experience it would be a long time before I has such another chance to throw away I told him it need not be thrown away that I had a friend concealed near by who would be glad enough to take to the place that had been provided for me I told him about poor Fanny and the kind-hearted noble fellow who never turned his back upon any body in distress white or black expressed his readiness to help her Aggie was much surprised when she found that we knew her secret She was rejoiced to hear of such a chance for Fanny and arrangements were made for her to go on board the vessel the next night They both supposed that I had long been at the north therefore my name was not mentioned in the transaction Fanny was carried on board at the appointed time and stowed away in a very small cabin This accommodation had been purchased at a price that would pay for a voyage to England But when one proposes to go to fine old England they stop to calculate whether they can afford the cost of the pleasure while in making a bargain to escape from slavery the trembling victim is ready to say Take all I have only don't betray me The next morning I peeped through my loophole and saw that it was dark and cloudy At night I received news that the wind was ahead and the vessel had not sailed I was exceedingly anxious about Fanny and Peter too who was running a tremendous risk at my instigation Next day the wind and weather remained the same Poor Fanny had been half dead with fright when they carried her on board and I could readily imagine how she must be suffering now Grandmother came often to my den to say how thankful she was I did not go On the third morning she rapped for me to come down to the storeroom The poor old sufferer was breaking down under her weight of trouble She was easily flurried now I found her in a nervous excited state but I was not aware that she had forgotten to lock the door behind her as usual She was exceedingly worried about the detention of the vessel She was afraid all would be discovered and then Fanny and Peter and I would all be tortured to death and Phillip should be utterly ruined and her house would be torn down Poor Peter If he should die such a horrible death as the poor slave James had lately done and all for his kindness in trying to help me how dreadful it would be for us all Alas the thought was familiar to me and had sent many a sharp pang through my heart I tried to suppress my own anxiety and speak soothingly to her She brought in some allusion to aunt Nancy the dear daughter she had recently buried and then she lost all control of herself As she stood there trembling and sobbing a voice from the piazza called out Whar is you aunt Marthy Grandmother was startled and in her agitation opened the door without thinking of me In stepped Jenny the mischievous housemaid who had tried to enter my room when I was concealed in the house of my white benefactress I's bin huntin ebery whar for you aunt Marthy said she My missis wants you to send her some crackers I had slunk down behind a barrel which entirely screened me but I imagined that Jenny was looking directly at the spot and my heart beat violently My grandmother immediately thought what she had done and went out quickly with Jenny to count the crackers locking the door behind her She returned to me in a few minutes the perfect picture of despair Poor child she exclaimed my carelessness has ruined you The boat ain't gone yet Get ready immediately and go with Fanny I ain't got another word to say against it now for there's no telling what may happen this day Uncle Phillip was sent for and he agreed with his mother in thinking that Jenny would inform Dr Flint in less than twenty-four hours He advised getting me on board the boat if possible if not I had better keep very still in my den where they could not find me without tearing the house down He said it would not do for him to move in the matter because suspicion would be immediately excited but he promised to communicate with Peter I felt reluctant to apply to him again having implicated him too much already but there seemed to be no alternative Vexed as Peter had been by my indecision he was true to his generous nature and said at once that he would do his best to help me trusting I should show myself a stronger woman this time He immediately proceeded to the wharf and found that the wind had shifted and the vessel was slowly beating down stream On some pretext of urgent necessity he offered two boatmen a dollar apiece to catch up with her He was of lighter complexion than the boatmen he hired and when the captain saw them coming so rapidly he thought officers were pursuing his vessel in search of the runaway slave he had on board They hoisted sails but the boat gained upon them and the indefatigable Peter sprang on board The captain at once recognized him Peter asked him to go below to speak about a bad bill he had given him When he told his errand the captain replied Why the woman's here already and I've put her where you or the devil would have a tough job to find her But it is another woman I want to bring said Peter She is in great distress too and you shall be paid any thing within reason if you'll stop and take her What's her name inquired the captain Linda he replied That's the the name of the woman already here rejoined the captain By George I believe you mean to betray me O exclaimed Peter God knows I wouldn't harm a hair of your head I am too grateful to you But there really is another woman in great danger Do have the humanity to stop and take her After a while they came to an understanding Fanny not dreaming I was any where about in that region had assumed my name though she called herself Johnson Linda is a common name said Peter and the woman I want to bring is Linda Brent The captain agreed to wait at a certain place till evening being handsomely paid for his detention Of course the day was an anxious one for us all But we concluded that if Jenny had seen me she would be too wise to let her mistress know of it and that she probably would not get a chance to see Dr Flint's family till evening for I knew very well what were the rules in that household I afterwards believed that she did not see me for nothing ever came of it and she was one of those base characters that would have jumped to betray a suffering fellow being for the sake of thirty pieces of silver I made all my arrangements to go on board as soon as it was dusk The intervening time I resolved to spend with my son I had not spoken to him for seven years though I had been under the same roof and seen him every day when I was well enough to sit at the loophole I did not dare to venture beyond the storeroom so they brought him there and locked us up together in a place concealed from the piazza door It was an agitating interview for both of us After we had talked and wept together for a little while he said Mother I'm glad you're going away I wish I could go with you I knew you was here and I have been so afraid they would come and catch you I was greatly surprised and asked him how he had found it out He replied I was standing under the eaves one day before Ellen went away and I heard somebody cough up over the wood shed I don't know what made me think it was you but I did think so I missed Ellen the night before she went away and grandmother brought her back into the room in the night and I thought maybe she'd been to see you before she went for I heard grandmother whisper to her 'Now go to sleep and remember never to tell' I asked him if he ever mentioned his suspicions to his sister He said he never did but after he heard the cough if he saw her playing with other children on that side of the house he always tried to coax her round to the other side for fear they would hear me cough too He said he had kept a close lookout for Dr Flint and if he saw him speak to a constable or a patrol he always told grandmother I now recollected that I had seen him manifest uneasiness when people were on that side of the house and I had at the time been puzzled to conjecture a motive for his actions Such prudence may seem extraordinary in a boy of twelve years but slaves being surrounded by mysteries deceptions and dangers early learn to be suspicious and watchful and prematurely cautious and cunning He had never asked a question of grandmother or uncle Phillip and I had often heard him chime in with other children when they spoke of my being at the north I told him I was now really going to the Free States and if he was a good honest boy and a loving child to his dear old grandmother the Lord would bless him and bring him to me and we and Ellen would live together He began to tell me that grandmother had not eaten any thing all day While he was speaking the door was unlocked and she came in with a small bag of money which she wanted me to take I begged her to keep a part of it at least to pay for Benny's being sent to the north but she insisted while her tears were falling fast that I should take the whole You may be sick among strangers she said and they would send you to the poorhouse to die Ah that good grandmother For the last time I went up to my nook Its desolate appearance no longer chilled me for the light of hope had risen in my soul Yet even with the blessed prospect of freedom before me I felt very sad at leaving forever that old homestead where I had been sheltered so long by the dear old grandmother where I had dreamed my first young dream of love and where after that had faded away my children came to twine themselves so closely round my desolate heart As the hour approached for me to leave I again descended to the storeroom My grandmother and Benny were there She took me by the hand and said Linda let us pray We knelt down together with my child pressed to my heart and my other arm round the faithful loving old friend I was about to leave forever On no other occasion has it ever been my lot to listen to so fervent a supplication for mercy and protection It thrilled through my heart and inspired me with trust in God Peter was waiting for me in the street I was soon by his side faint in body but strong of purpose I did not look back upon the old place though I felt that I should never see it again XXX NORTHWARD BOUND I NEVER could tell how we reached the wharf My brain was all of a whirl and my limbs tottered under me At an appointed place we met my uncle Phillip who had started before us on a different route that he might reach the wharf first and give us timely warning if there was any danger A row-boat was in readiness As I was about to step in I felt something pull me gently and turning round I saw Benny looking pale and anxious He whispered in my ear I've been peeping into the doctor's window and he's at home Don't cry I'll come He hastened away I clasped the hand of my good uncle to whom I owed so much and of Peter the brave generous friend who had volunteered to run such terrible risks to secure my safety To this day I remember how bright his face beamed with joy when he told me he had discovered a safe method for me to escape Yet that intelligent enterprising noble-hearted man was a chattel liable by the laws of a country that calls itself civilized to be sold with horses and pigs We parted in silence Our hearts were all too full for words Swiftly the boat glided over the water After a while one of the sailors said Don't be down-hearted madam We will take you safely to your husband in At first I could not imagine what he meant but I had presence of mind to think that it probably referred to something the captain had told him so I thanked him and said I hoped we should have pleasant weather When I entered the vessel the captain came forward to meet me He was an elderly man with a pleasant countenance He showed me to a little box of a cabin where sat my friend Fanny She started as if she had seen a spectre She gazed on me in utter astonishment and exclaimed Linda can this be you or is it your ghost When we were locked in each other's arms my overwrought feelings could no longer be restrained My sobs reached the ears of the captain who came and very kindly reminded us that for his safety as well as our own it would be prudent for us not to attract any attention He said that when there was a sail in sight he wished us to keep below but at other times he had no objection to our being on deck He assured us that he would keep a good lookout and if we acted prudently he thought we should be in no danger He had represented us as women going to meet our husbands in We thanked him and promised to observe carefully all the directions he gave us Fanny and I now talked by ourselves low and quietly in our little cabin She told me of the sufferings she had gone through in making her escape and of her terrors while she was concealed in her mother's house Above all she dwelt on the agony of separation from all her children on that dreadful auction day She could scarcely credit me when I told her of the place where I had passed nearly seven years We have the same sorrows said I No replied she you are going to see your children soon and there is no hope that I shall ever even hear from mine The vessel was soon under way but we made slow progress The wind was against us I should not have cared for this if we had been out of sight of the town but until there were miles of water between us and our enemies we were filled with constant apprehension that the constables would come on board Neither could I feel quite at ease with the captain and his men I was an entire stranger to that class of people and I had heard that sailors were rough and sometimes cruel We were so completely in their power that if they were bad men our situation would be dreadful Now that the captain was paid for our passage might he not be tempted to make more money by giving us up to those who claimed us as property I was naturally of a confiding disposition but slavery had made me suspicious of every body Fanny did not share my distrust of the captain or his men She said she was afraid at first but she had been on board three days while the vessel lay in the dock and nobody had betrayed her or treated her otherwise than kindly The captain soon came to advise us to go on deck for fresh air His friendly and respectful manner combined with Fanny's testimony reassured me and we went with him He placed us in a comfortable seat and occasionally entered into conversations He told us he was a Southerner by birth and had spent the greater part of his life in the Slave States and that he had recently lost a brother who traded in slaves But said he it is a pitiable and degrading business and I always felt ashamed to acknowledge my brother in connection with it As we passed Snaky Swamp he pointed to it and said There is a slave territory that defies all the laws I though of the terrible days I had spent there and though it was not called Dismal Swamp it made me feel very dismal as I looked at it I shall never forget that night The balmy air of spring was so refreshing And how shall I describe my sensations when we were fairly sailing on Chesapeake Bay O the beautiful sunshine the exhilarating breeze and I could enjoy them without fear or restraint I had never realized what grand things air and sunlight are till I had been deprived of them Ten days after we left land we were approaching Philadelphia The captain said we should arrive there in the night but he thought we had better wait till morning and go on shore in broad daylight as the best way to avoid suspicion I replied You know best But will you stay on board and protect us He saw that I was suspicious and he said he was sorry now that he had brought us to the end of our voyage to find I had so little confidence in him Ah if he had ever been a slave he would have known how difficult it was to trust a white man He assured us that we might sleep through the night without fear that he would take care we were not left unprotected Be it said to the honor of this captain Southerner as he was that if Fanny and I had been white ladies and our passage lawfully engaged he could not have treated us more respectfully My intelligent friend Peter had rightly estimated the character of the man to whose honor he had intrusted us The next morning I was on deck as soon as the day dawned I called Fanny to see the sunrise for the first time in our lives on free soil for such I then believed it to be We watched the reddening sky and saw the great orb come up slowly out of the water as it seemed Soon the waves began to sparkle and every thing caught the beautiful glow Before us lay the city of strangers We looked at each other and the eyes of both were moistened with tears We had escaped from slavery and we supposed ourselves to be safe from the hunters But we were alone in the world and we had left dear ties behind us ties cruelly sundered by the demon Slavery XXXI INCIDENTS IN PHILADELPHIA I HAD heard that the poor slave had many friends at the north I trusted we should find some of them Meantime we would take it for granted that all were friends till they proved to the contrary I sought out the kind captain thanked him for his attentions and told him I should never cease to be grateful for the service he had rendered us I gave him a message to the friends I had left at home and he promised to deliver it We were placed in a row-boat and in about fifteen minutes were landed on a wood wharf in Philadelphia As I stood looking round the friendly captain touched me on the shoulder and said There is a respectable-looking colored man behind you I will speak to him about the New York trains and tell him you wish to go directly on I thanked him and asked him to direct me to some shops where I could buy gloves and veils He did so and said he would talk with the colored man till I returned I made what haste I could Constant exercise on board the vessel and frequent rubbing with salt water had nearly restored the use of my limbs The noise of the great city confused me but I found the shops and bought some double veils and gloves for Fanny and myself The shopman told me they were so many levies I had never heard the word before but I did not tell him so I thought if he knew I was a stranger he might ask me where I came from I gave him a gold piece and when he returned the change I counted it and found out how much a levy was I made my way back to the wharf where the captain introduced me to the colored man as the Rev Jeremiah Durham minister of Bethel church He took me by the hand as if I had been an old friend He told us we were too late for the morning cars to New York and must wait until the evening or the next morning He invited me to go home with him assuring me that his wife would give me a cordial welcome and for my friend he would provide a home with one of his neighbors I thanked him for so much kindness to strangers and told him if I must be detained I should like to hunt up some people who formerly went from our part of the country Mr Durham insisted that I should dine with him and then he would assist me in finding my friends The sailors came to bid us good by I shook their hardy hands with tears in my eyes They had all been kind to us and they had rendered us a greater service than they could possibly conceive of I had never seen so large a city or been in contact with so many people in the streets It seemed as if those who passed looked at us with an expression of curiosity My face was so blistered and peeled by sitting on deck in wind and sunshine that I thought they could not easily decide to what nation I belonged Mrs Durham met me with a kindly welcome without asking any questions I was tired and her friendly manner was a sweet refreshment God bless her I was sure that she had comforted other weary hearts before I received her sympathy She was surrounded by her husband and children in a home made sacred by protecting laws I thought of my own children and sighed After dinner Mr Durham went with me in quest of the friends I had spoken of They went from my native town and I anticipated much pleasure in looking on familiar faces They were not at home and we retraced our steps through streets delightfully clean On the way Mr Durham observed that I had spoken to him of a daughter I expected to meet that he was surprised for I looked so young he had taken me for a single woman He was approaching a subject on which I was extremely sensitive He would ask about my husband next I thought and if I answered him truly what would he think of me I told him I had two children one in New York the other at the south He asked some further questions and I frankly told him some of the most important events of my life It was painful for me to do it but I would not deceive him If he was desirous of being my friend I thought he ought to know how far I was worthy of it Excuse me if I have tried your feelings said he I did not question you from idle curiosity I wanted to understand your situation in order to know whether I could be of any service to you or your little girl Your straight-forward answers do you credit but don't answer every body so openly It might give some heartless people a pretext for treating you with contempt That word contempt burned me like coals of fire I replied God alone knows how I have suffered and He I trust will forgive me If I am permitted to have my children I intend to be a good mother and to live in such a manner that people cannot treat me with contempt I respect your sentiments said he Place your trust in God and be governed by good principles and you will not fail to find friends When we reached home I went to my room glad to shut out the world for a while The words he had spoken made an indelible impression upon me They brought up great shadows from the mournful past In the midst of my meditations I was startled by a knock at the door Mrs Durham entered her face all beaming with kindness to say that there was an anti-slavery friend down stairs who would like to see me I overcame my dread of encountering strangers and went with her Many questions were asked concerning my experiences and my escape from slavery but I observed how careful they all were not to say any thing that might wound my feelings How gratifying this was can be fully understood only by those who have been accustomed to be treated as if they were not included within the pale of human beings The anti-slavery friend had come to inquire into my plans and to offer assistance if needed Fanny was comfortably established for the present with a friend of Mr Durham The Anti-Slavery Society agreed to pay her expenses to New York The same was offered to me but I declined to accept it telling them that my grandmother had given me sufficient to pay my expenses to the end of my journey We were urged to remain in Philadelphia a few days until some suitable escort could be found for us I gladly accepted the proposition for I had a dread of meeting slaveholders and some dread also of railroads I had never entered a railroad car in my life and it seemed to me quite an important event That night I sought my pillow with feelings I had never carried to it before I verily believed myself to be a free woman I was wakeful for a long time and I had no sooner fallen asleep than I was roused by fire-bells I jumped up and hurried on my clothes Where I came from every body hastened to dress themselves on such occasions The white people thought a great fire might be used as a good opportunity for insurrection and that it was best to be in readiness and the colored people were ordered out to labor in extinguishing the flames There was but one engine in our town and colored women and children were often required to drag it to the river's edge and fill it Mrs Durham's daughter slept in the same room with me and seeing that she slept through all the din I thought it was my duty to wake her What's the matter said she rubbing her eyes They're screaming fire in the streets and the bells are ringing I replied What of that said she drowsily We are used to it We never get up without the fire is very near What good would it do I was quite surprised that it was not necessary for us to go and help fill the engine I was an ignorant child just beginning to learn how things went on in great cities At daylight I heard women crying fresh fish berries radishes and various other things All this was new to me I dressed myself at an early hour and sat at the window to watch that unknown tide of life Philadelphia seemed to be a wonderfully great place At the breakfast table my idea of going out to drag the engine was laughed over and I joined in the mirth I went to see Fanny and found her so well contented among her new friends that she was in no haste to leave I was also very happy with my kind hostess She had had advantages for education and was vastly my superior Every day almost every hour I was adding to my little stock of knowledge She took me out to see the city as much as she deemed prudent One day she took me to an artist's room and showed me the portraits of some of her children I had never seen any paintings of colored people before and they seemed to me beautiful At the end of five days one of Mrs Durham's friends offered to accompany us to New York the following morning As I held the hand of my good hostess in a parting clasp I longed to know whether her husband had repeated to her what I had told him I supposed he had but she never made any allusion to it I presume it was the delicate silence of womanly sympathy When Mr Durham handed us our tickets he said I am afraid you will have a disagreeable ride but I could not procure tickets for the first class cars Supposing I had not given him money enough I offered more O no said he they could not be had for any money They don't allow colored people to go in the first-class cars This was the first chill to my enthusiasm about the Free States Colored people were allowed to ride in a filthy box behind white people at the south but there they were not required to pay for the privilege It made me sad to find how the north aped the customs of slavery We were stowed away in a large rough car with windows on each side too high for us to look out without standing up It was crowded with people apparently of all nations There were plenty of beds and cradles containing screaming and kicking babies Every other man had a cigar or pipe in his mouth and jugs of whiskey were handed round freely The fumes of the whiskey and the dense tobacco smoke were sickening to my senses and my mind was equally nauseated by the coarse jokes and ribald songs around me It was a very disagreeable ride Since that time there has been some improvement in these matters XXXII THE MEETING OF MOTHER AND DAUGHTER When we arrived in New York I was half crazed by the crowd of coachmen calling out Carriage ma'am We bargained with one to take us to Sullivan Street for twelve shillings A burly Irishman stepped up and said I'll tak' ye for sax shillings The reduction of half the price was an object to us and we asked if he could take us right away Troth an I will ladies he replied I noticed that the hackmen smiled at each other and I inquired whether his conveyance was decent Yes it's dacent it is marm Devil a bit would I be after takin' ladies in a cab that was not dacent We gave him our checks He went for the baggage and soon reappeared saying This way if you plase ladies We followed and found our trunks on a truck and we were invited to take our seats on them We told him that was not what we bargained for and he must take the trunks off He swore they should not be touched till we had paid him six shillings In our situation it was not prudent to attract attention and I was about to pay him what he required when a man near by shook his head for me not to do it After a great ado we got rid of the Irishman and had our trunks fastened on a hack We had been recommended to a boarding-house in Sullivan Street and thither we drove There Fanny and I separated The Anti-Slavery Society provided a home for her and I afterwards heard of her in prosperous circumstances I sent for an old friend from my part of the country who had for some time been doing business in New York He came immediately I told him I wanted to go to my daughter and asked him to aid me in procuring an interview I cautioned him not to let it be known to the family that I had just arrived from the south because they supposed I had been at the north seven years He told me there was a colored woman in Brooklyn who came from the same town I did and I had better go to her house and have my daughter meet me there I accepted the proposition thankfully and he agreed to escort me to Brooklyn We crossed Fulton ferry went up Myrtle Avenue and stopped at the house he designated I was just about to enter when two girls passed My friend called my attention to them I turned and recognized in the eldest Sarah the daughter of a woman who used to live with my grandmother but who had left the south years ago Surprised and rejoiced at this unexpected meeting I threw my arms round her and inquired concerning her mother You take no notice of the other girl said my friend I turned and there stood my Ellen I pressed her to my heart then held her away from me to take a look at her She had changed a good deal in the two years since I parted from her Signs of neglect could be discerned by eyes less observing than a mother's My friend invited us all to go into the house but Ellen said she had been sent of an errand which she would do as quickly as possible and go home and ask Mrs Hobbs to let her come and see me It was agreed that I should send for her the next day Her companion Sarah hastened to tell her mother of my arrival When I entered the house I found the mistress of it absent and I waited for her return Before I saw her I heard her saying Where is Linda Brent I used to know her father and mother Soon Sarah came with her mother So there was quite a company of us all from my grandmother's neighborhood These friends gathered round me and questioned me eagerly They laughed they cried and they shouted They thanked God that I had got away from my persecutors and was safe on Long Island It was a day of great excitement How different from the silent days I had passed in my dreary den The next morning was Sunday My first waking thoughts were occupied with the note I was to send to Mrs Hobbs the lady with whom Ellen lived That I had recently come into that vicinity was evident otherwise I should have sooner inquired for my daughter It would not do to let them know I had just arrived from the south for that would involve the suspicion of my having been harbored there and might bring trouble if not ruin on several people I like a straightforward course and am always reluctant to resort to subterfuges So far as my ways have been crooked I charge them all upon slavery It was that system of violence and wrong which now left me no alternative but to enact a falsehood I began my note by stating that I had recently arrived from Canada and was very desirous to have my daughter come to see me She came and brought a message from Mrs Hobbs inviting me to her house and assuring me that I need not have any fears The conversation I had with my child did not leave my mind at ease When I asked if she was well treated she answered yes but there was no heartiness in the tone and it seemed to me that she said it from an unwillingness to have me troubled on her account Before she left me she asked very earnestly Mother when will you take me to live with you It made me sad to think that I could not give her a home till I went to work and earned the means and that might take me a long time When she was placed with Mrs Hobbs the agreement was that she should be sent to school She had been there two years and was now nine years old and she scarcely knew her letters There was no excuse for this for there were good public schools in Brooklyn to which she could have been sent without expense She staid with me till dark and I went home with her I was received in a friendly manner by the family and all agreed in saying that Ellen was a useful good girl Mrs Hobbs looked me coolly in the face and said I suppose you know that my cousin Mr Sands has given her to my eldest daughter She will make a nice waiting-maid for her when she grows up I did not answer a word How could she who knew by experience the strength of a mother's love and who was perfectly aware of the relation Mr Sands bore to my childrenhow could she look me in the face while she thrust such a dagger into my heart I was no longer surprised that they had kept her in such a state of ignorance Mr Hobbs had formerly been wealthy but he had failed and afterwards obtained a subordinate situation in the Custom House Perhaps they expected to return to the south some day and Ellen's knowledge was quite sufficient for a slave's condition I was impatient to go to work and earn money that I might change the uncertain position of my children Mr Sands had not kept his promise to emancipate them I had also been deceived about Ellen What security had I with regard to Benjamin I felt that I had none I returned to my friend's house in an uneasy state of mind In order to protect my children it was necessary that I should own myself I called myself free and sometimes felt so but I knew I was insecure I sat down that night and wrote a civil letter to Dr Flint asking him to state the lowest terms on which he would sell me and as I belonged by law to his daughter I wrote to her also making a similar request Since my arrival at the north I had not been unmindful of my dear brother William I had made diligent inquiries for him and having heard of him in Boston I went thither When I arrived there I found he had gone to New Bedford I wrote to that place and was informed he had gone on a whaling voyage and would not return for some months I went back to New York to get employment near Ellen I received an answer from Dr Flint which gave me no encouragement He advised me to return and submit myself to my rightful owners and then any request I might make would be granted I lent this letter to a friend who lost it otherwise I would present a copy to my readers XXXIII A HOME FOUND MY greatest anxiety now was to obtain employment My health was greatly improved though my limbs continued to trouble me with swelling whenever I walked much The greatest difficulty in my way was that those who employed strangers required a recommendation and in my peculiar position I could of course obtain no certificates from the families I had so faithfully served One day an acquaintance told me of a lady who wanted a nurse for her babe and I immediately applied for the situation The lady told me she preferred to have one who had been a mother and accustomed to the care of infants I told her I had nursed two babes of my own She asked me many questions but to my great relief did not require a recommendation from my former employers She told me she was an English woman and that was a pleasant circumstance to me because I had heard they had less prejudice against color than Americans entertained It was agreed that we should try each other for a week The trial proved satisfactory to both parties and I was engaged for a month The heavenly Father had been most merciful to me in leading me to this place Mrs Bruce was a kind and gentle lady and proved a true and sympathizing friend Before the stipulated month expired the necessity of passing up and down stairs frequently caused my limbs to swell so painfully that I became unable to perform my duties Many ladies would have thoughtlessly discharged me but Mrs Bruce made arrangements to save me steps and employed a physician to attend upon me I had not yet told her that I was a fugitive slave She noticed that I was often sad and kindly inquired the cause I spoke of being separated from my children and from relatives who were dear to me but I did not mention the constant feeling of insecurity which oppressed my spirits I longed for some one to confide in but I had been so deceived by white people that I had lost all confidence in them If they spoke kind words to me I thought it was for some selfish purpose I had entered this family with the distrustful feelings I had brought with me out of slavery but ere six months had passed I found that the gentle deportment of Mrs Bruce and the smiles of her lovely babe were thawing my chilled heart My narrow mind also began to expand under the influences of her intelligent conversation and the opportunities for reading which were gladly allowed me whenever I had leisure from my duties I gradually became more energetic and more cheerful The old feeling of insecurity especially with regard to my children often threw its dark shadow across my sunshine Mrs Bruce offered me a home for Ellen but pleasant as it would have been I did not dare to accept it for fear of offending the Hobbs family Their knowledge of my precarious situation placed me in their power and I felt that it was important for me to keep on the right side of them till by dint of labor and economy I could make a home for my children I was far from feeling satisfied with Ellen's situation She was not well cared for She sometimes came to New York to visit me but she generally brought a request from Mrs Hobbs that I would buy her a pair of shoes or some article of clothing This was accompanied by a promise of payment when Mr Hobbs's salary at the Custom House became due but some how or other the pay-day never came Thus many dollars of my earnings were expended to keep my child comfortably clothed That however was a slight trouble compared with the fear that their pecuniary embarrassments might induce them to sell my precious young daughter I knew they were in constant communication with Southerners and had frequent opportunities to do it I have stated that when Dr Flint put Ellen in jail at two years old she had an inflammation of the eyes occasioned by measles This disease still troubled her and kind Mrs Bruce proposed that she should come to New York for a while to be under the care of Dr Elliott a well known oculist It did not occur to me that there was any thing improper in a mother's making such a request but Mrs Hobbs was very angry and refused to let her go Situated as I was it was not politic to insist upon it I made no complaint but I longed to be entirely free to act a mother's part towards my children The next time I went over to Brooklyn Mrs Hobbs as if to apologize for her anger told me she had employed her own physician to attend to Ellen's eyes and that she had refused my request because she did not consider it safe to trust her in New York I accepted the explanation in silence but she had told me that my child belonged to her daughter and I suspected that her real motive was a fear of my conveying her property away from her Perhaps I did her injustice but my knowledge of Southerners made it difficult for me to feel otherwise Sweet and bitter were mixed in the cup of my life and I was thankful that it had ceased to be entirely bitter I loved Mrs Bruce's babe When it laughed and crowed in my face and twined its little tender arms confidingly about my neck it made me think of the time when Benny and Ellen were babies and my wounded heart was soothed One bright morning as I stood at the window tossing baby in my arms my attention was attracted by a young man in sailor's dress who was closely observing every house as he passed I looked at him earnestly Could it be my brother William It must be heand yet how changed I placed the baby safely flew down stairs opened the front door beckoned to the sailor and in less than a minute I was clasped in my brother's arms How much we had to tell each other How we laughed and how we cried over each other's adventures I took him to Brooklyn and again saw him with Ellen the dear child whom he had loved and tended so carefully while I was shut up in my miserable den He staid in New York a week His old feelings of affection for me and Ellen were as lively as ever There are no bonds so strong as those which are formed by suffering together XXXIV THE OLD ENEMY AGAIN MY young mistress Miss Emily Flint did not return any answer to my letter requesting her to consent to my being sold But after a while I received a reply which purported to be written by her younger brother In order rightly to enjoy the contents of this letter the reader must bear in mind that the Flint family supposed I had been at the north many years They had no idea that I knew of the doctor's three excursions to New York in search of me that I had heard his voice when he came to borrow five hundred dollars for that purpose and that I had seen him pass on his way to the steamboat Neither were they aware that all the particulars of aunt Nancy's death and burial were conveyed to me at the time they occurred I have kept the letter of which I herewith subjoin a copy Your letter to sister was received a few days ago I gather from it that you are desirous of returning to your native place among your friends and relatives We were all gratified with the contents of your letter and let me assure you that if any members of the family have had any feeling of resentment towards you they feel it no longer We all sympathize with you in your unfortunate condition and are ready to do all in our power to make you contented and happy It is difficult for you to return home as a free person If you were purchased by your grandmother it is doubtful whether you would be permitted to remain although it would be lawful for you to do so If a servant should be allowed to purchase herself after absenting herself so long from her owners and return free it would have an injurious effect From your letter I think your situation must be hard and uncomfortable Come home You have it in your power to be reinstated in our affections We would receive you with open arms and tears of joy You need not apprehend any unkind treatment as we have not put ourselves to any trouble or expense to get you Had we done so perhaps we should feel otherwise You know my sister was always attached to you and that you were never treated as a slave You were never put to hard work nor exposed to field labor On the contrary you were taken into the house and treated as one of us and almost as free and we at least felt that you were above disgracing yourself by running away Believing you may be induced to come home voluntarily has induced me to write for my sister The family will be rejoiced to see you and your poor old grandmother expressed a great desire to have you come when she heard your letter read In her old age she needs the consolation of having her children round her Doubtless you have heard of the death of your aunt She was a faithful servant and a faithful member of the Episcopal church In her Christian life she taught us how to liveand O too high the price of knowledge she taught us how to die Could you have seen us round her death bed with her mother all mingling our tears in one common stream you would have thought the same heartfelt tie existed between a master and his servant as between a mother and her child But this subject is too painful to dwell upon I must bring my letter to a close If you are contented to stay away from your old grandmother your child and the friends who love you stay where you are We shall never trouble ourselves to apprehend you But should you prefer to come home we will do all that we can to make you happy If you do not wish to remain in the family I know that father by our persuasion will be induced to let you be purchased by any person you may choose in our community You will please answer this as soon as possible and let us know your decision Sister sends much love to you In the mean time believe me your sincere friend and well wisher This letter was signed by Emily's brother who was as yet a mere lad I knew by the style that it was not written by a person of his age and though the writing was disguised I had been made too unhappy by it in former years not to recognize at once the hand of Dr Flint O the hypocrisy of slaveholders Did the old fox suppose I was goose enough to go into such a trap Verily he relied too much on the stupidity of the African race I did not return the family of Flints any thanks for their cordial invitationa remissness for which I was no doubt charged with base ingratitude Not long afterwards I received a letter from one of my friends at the south informing me that Dr Flint was about to visit the north The letter had been delayed and I supposed he might be already on the way Mrs Bruce did not know I was a fugitive I told her that important business called me to Boston where my brother then was and asked permission to bring a friend to supply my place as nurse for a fortnight I started on my journey immediately and as soon as I arrived I wrote to my grandmother that if Benny came he must be sent to Boston I knew she was only waiting for a good chance to send him north and fortunately she had the legal power to do so without asking leave of any body She was a free woman and when my children were purchased Mr Sands preferred to have the bill of sale drawn up in her name It was conjectured that he advanced the money but it was not known At the south a gentleman may have a shoal of colored children without any disgrace but if he is known to purchase them with the view of setting them free the example is thought to be dangerous to their peculiar institution and he becomes unpopular There was a good opportunity to send Benny in a vessel coming directly to New York He was put on board with a letter to a friend who was requested to see him off to Boston Early one morning there was a loud rap at my door and in rushed Benjamin all out of breath O mother he exclaimed here I am I run all the way and I come all alone How d'you do O reader can you imagine my joy No you cannot unless you have been a slave mother Benjamin rattled away as fast as his tongue could go Mother why don't you bring Ellen here I went over to Brooklyn to see her and she felt very bad when I bid her good by She said 'O Ben I wish I was going too' I thought she'd know ever so much but she don't know so much as I do for I can read and she can't And mother I lost all my clothes coming What can I do to get some more I 'spose free boys can get along here at the north as well as white boys I did not like to tell the sanguine happy little fellow how much he was mistaken I took him to a tailor and procured a change of clothes The rest of the day was spent in mutual asking and answering of questions with the wish constantly repeated that the good old grandmother was with us and frequent injunctions from Benny to write to her immediately and be sure to tell her every thing about his voyage and his journey to Boston Dr Flint made his visit to New York and made every exertion to call upon me and invite me to return with him but not being able to ascertain where I was his hospitable intentions were frustrated and the affectionate family who were waiting for me with open arms were doomed to disappointment As soon as I knew he was safely at home I placed Benjamin in the care of my brother William and returned to Mrs Bruce There I remained through the winter and spring endeavoring to perform my duties faithfully and finding a good degree of happiness in the attractions of baby Mary the considerate kindness of her excellent mother and occasional interviews with my darling daughter But when summer came the old feeling of insecurity haunted me It was necessary for me to take little Mary out daily for exercise and fresh air and the city was swarming with Southerners some of whom might recognize me Hot weather brings out snakes and slaveholders and I like one class of the venomous creatures as little as I do the other What a comfort it is to be free to say so XXXV PREJUDICE AGAINST COLOR IT was a relief to my mind to see preparations for leaving the city We went to Albany in the steamboat Knickerbocker When the gong sounded for tea Mrs Bruce said Linda it is late and you and baby had better come to the table with me I replied I know it is time baby had her supper but I had rather not go with you if you please I am afraid of being insulted O no not if you are with me she said I saw several white nurses go with their ladies and I ventured to do the same We were at the extreme end of the table I was no sooner seated than a gruff voice said Get up You know you are not allowed to sit here I looked up and to my astonishment and indignation saw that the speaker was a colored man If his office required him to enforce the by-laws of the boat he might at least have done it politely I replied I shall not get up unless the captain comes and takes me up No cup of tea was offered me but Mrs Bruce handed me hers and called for another I looked to see whether the other nurses were treated in a similar manner They were all properly waited on Next morning when we stopped at Troy for breakfast every body was making a rush for the table Mrs Bruce said Take my arm Linda and we'll go in together The landlord heard her and said Madam will you allow your nurse and baby to take breakfast with my family I knew this was to be attributed to my complexion but he spoke courteously and therefore I did not mind it At Saratoga we found the United States Hotel crowded and Mr Bruce took one of the cottages belonging to the hotel I had thought with gladness of going to the quiet of the country where I should meet few people but here I found myself in the midst of a swarm of Southerners I looked round me with fear and trembling dreading to see some one who would recognize me I was rejoiced to find that we were to stay but a short time We soon returned to New York to make arrangements for spending the remainder of the summer at Rockaway While the laundress was putting the clothes in order I took an opportunity to go over to Brooklyn to see Ellen I met her going to a grocery store and the first words she said were O mother don't go to Mrs Hobbs's Her brother Mr Thorne has come from the south and may be he'll tell where you are I accepted the warning I told her I was going away with Mrs Bruce the next day and would try to see her when I came back Being in servitude to the Anglo-Saxon race I was not put into a Jim Crow car on our way to Rockaway neither was I invited to ride through the streets on the top of trunks in a truck but every where I found the same manifestations of that cruel prejudice which so discourages the feelings and represses the energies of the colored people We reached Rockaway before dark and put up at the Paviliona large hotel beautifully situated by the sea-sidea great resort of the fashionable world Thirty or forty nurses were there of a great variety of nations Some of the ladies had colored waiting-maids and coachmen but I was the only nurse tinged with the blood of Africa When the tea bell rang I took little Mary and followed the other nurses Supper was served in a long hall A young man who had the ordering of things took the circuit of the table two or three times and finally pointed me to a seat at the lower end of it As there was but one chair I sat down and took the child in my lap Whereupon the young man came to me and said in the blandest manner possible Will you please to seat the little girl in the chair and stand behind it and feed her After they have done you will be shown to the kitchen where you will have a good supper This was the climax I found it hard to preserve my self-control when I looked round and saw women who were nurses as I was and only one shade lighter in complexion eyeing me with a defiant look as if my presence were a contamination However I said nothing I quietly took the child in my arms went to our room and refused to go to the table again Mr Bruce ordered meals to be sent to the room for little Mary and I This answered for a few days but the waiters of the establishment were white and they soon began to complain saying they were not hired to wait on negroes The landlord requested Mr Bruce to send me down to my meals because his servants rebelled against bringing them up and the colored servants of other boarders were dissatisfied because all were not treated alike My answer was that the colored servants ought to be dissatisfied with themselves for not having too much self-respect to submit to such treatment that there was no difference in the price of board for colored and white servants and there was no justification for difference of treatment I staid a month after this and finding I was resolved to stand up for my rights they concluded to treat me well Let every colored man and woman do this and eventually we shall cease to be trampled under foot by our oppressors XXXVI THE HAIRBREADTH ESCAPE AFTER we returned to New York I took the earliest opportunity to go and see Ellen I asked to have her called down stairs for I supposed Mrs Hobbs's southern brother might still be there and I was desirous to avoid seeing him if possible But Mrs Hobbs came to the kitchen and insisted on my going up stairs My brother wants to see you said she and he is sorry you seem to shun him He knows you are living in New York He told me to say to you that he owes thanks to good old aunt Martha for too many little acts of kindness for him to be base enough to betray her grandchild This Mr Thorne had become poor and reckless long before he left the south and such persons had much rather go to one of the faithful old slaves to borrow a dollar or get a good dinner than to go to one whom they consider an equal It was such acts of kindness as these for which he professed to feel grateful to my grandmother I wished he had kept at a distance but as he was here and knew where I was I concluded there was nothing to be gained by trying to avoid him on the contrary it might be the means of exciting his ill will I followed his sister up stairs He met me in a very friendly manner congratulated me on my escape from slavery and hoped I had a good place where I felt happy I continued to visit Ellen as often as I could She good thoughtful child never forgot my hazardous situation but always kept a vigilant lookout for my safety She never made any complaint about her own inconveniences and troubles but a mother's observing eye easily perceived that she was not happy On the occasion of one of my visits I found her unusually serious When I asked her what was the matter she said nothing was the matter But I insisted upon knowing what made her look so very grave Finally I ascertained that she felt troubled about the dissipation that was continually going on in the house She was sent to the store very often for rum and brandy and she felt ashamed to ask for it so often and Mr Hobbs and Mr Thorne drank a great deal and their hands trembled so that they had to call her to pour out the liquor for them But for all that said she Mr Hobbs is good to me and I can't help liking him I feel sorry for him I tried to comfort her by telling her that I had laid up a hundred dollars and that before long I hoped to be able to give her and Benjamin a home and send them to school She was always desirous not to add to my troubles more than she could help and I did not discover till years afterwards that Mr Thorne's intemperance was not the only annoyance she suffered from him Though he professed too much gratitude to my grandmother to injure any of her descendants he had poured vile language into the ears of her innocent great-grandchild I usually went to Brooklyn to spend Sunday afternoon One Sunday I found Ellen anxiously waiting for me near the house O mother said she I've been waiting for you this long time I'm afraid Mr Thorne has written to tell Dr Flint where you are Make haste and come in Mrs Hobbs will tell you all about it The story was soon told While the children were playing in the grape-vine arbor the day before Mr Thorne came out with a letter in his hand which he tore up and scattered about Ellen was sweeping the yard at the time and having her mind full of suspicions of him she picked up the pieces and carried them to the children saying I wonder who Mr Thorne has been writing to I'm sure I don't know and don't care replied the oldest of the children and I don't see how it concerns you But it does concern me replied Ellen for I'm afraid he's been writing to the south about my mother They laughed at her and called her a silly thing but good-naturedly put the fragments of writing together in order to read them to her They were no sooner arranged than the little girl exclaimed I declare Ellen I believe you are right The contents of Mr Thorne's letter as nearly as I can remember were as follows I have seen your slave Linda and conversed with her She can be taken very easily if you manage prudently There are enough of us here to swear to her identity as your property I am a patriot a lover of my country and I do this as an act of justice to the laws He concluded by informing the doctor of the street and number where I lived The children carried the pieces to Mrs Hobbs who immediately went to her brother's room for an explanation He was not to be found The servants said they saw him go out with a letter in his hand and they supposed he had gone to the post office The natural inference was that he had sent to Dr Flint a copy of those fragments When he returned his sister accused him of it and he did not deny the charge He went immediately to his room and the next morning he was missing He had gone over to New York before any of the family were astir It was evident that I had no time to lose and I hastened back to the city with a heavy heart Again I was to be torn from a comfortable home and all my plans for the welfare of my children were to be frustrated by that demon Slavery I now regretted that I never told Mrs Bruce my story I had not concealed it merely on account of being a fugitive that would have made her anxious but it would have excited sympathy in her kind heart I valued her good opinion and I was afraid of losing it if I told her all the particulars of my sad story But now I felt that it was necessary for her to know how I was situated I had once left her abruptly without explaining the reason and it would not be proper to do it again I went home resolved to tell her in the morning But the sadness of my face attracted her attention and in answer to her kind inquiries I poured out my full heart to her before bed time She listened with true womanly sympathy and told me she would do all she could to protect me How my heart blessed her Early the next morning Judge Vanderpool and Lawyer Hopper were consulted They said I had better leave the city at once as the risk would be great if the case came to trial Mrs Bruce took me in a carriage to the house of one of her friends where she assured me I should be safe until my brother could arrive which would be in a few days In the interval my thoughts were much occupied with Ellen She was mine by birth and she was also mine by Southern law since my grandmother held the bill of sale that made her so I did not feel that she was safe unless I had her with me Mrs Hobbs who felt badly about her brother's treachery yielded to my entreaties on condition that she should return in ten days I avoided making any promise She came to me clad in very thin garments all outgrown and with a school satchel on her arm containing a few articles It was late in October and I knew the child must suffer and not daring to go out in the streets to purchase any thing I took off my own flannel skirt and converted it into one for her Kind Mrs Bruce came to bid me good by and when she saw that I had taken off my clothing for my child the tears came to her eyes She said Wait for me Linda and went out She soon returned with a nice warm shawl and hood for Ellen Truly of such souls as hers are the kingdom of heaven My brother reached New York on Wednesday Lawyer Hopper advised us to go to Boston by the Stonington route as there was less Southern travel in that direction Mrs Bruce directed her servants to tell all inquirers that I formerly lived there but had gone from the city We reached the steamboat Rhode Island in safety That boat employed colored hands but I knew that colored passengers were not admitted to the cabin I was very desirous for the seclusion of the cabin not only on account of exposure to the night air but also to avoid observation Lawyer Hopper was waiting on board for us He spoke to the stewardess and asked as a particular favor that she would treat us well He said to me Go and speak to the captain yourself by and by Take your little girl with you and I am sure that he will not let her sleep on deck With these kind words and a shake of the hand he departed The boat was soon on her way bearing me rapidly from the friendly home where I had hoped to find security and rest My brother had left me to purchase the tickets thinking that I might have better success than he would When the stewardess came to me I paid what she asked and she gave me three tickets with clipped corners In the most unsophisticated manner I said You have made a mistake I asked you for cabin tickets I cannot possibly consent to sleep on deck with my little daughter She assured me there was no mistake She said on some of the routes colored people were allowed to sleep in the cabin but not on this route which was much travelled by the wealthy I asked her to show me to the captain's office and she said she would after tea When the time came I took Ellen by the hand and went to the captain politely requesting him to change our tickets as we should be very uncomfortable on deck He said it was contrary to their custom but he would see that we had berths below he would also try to obtain comfortable seats for us in the cars of that he was not certain but he would speak to the conductor about it when the boat arrived I thanked him and returned to the ladies' cabin He came afterwards and told me that the conductor of the cars was on board that he had spoken to him and he had promised to take care of us I was very much surprised at receiving so much kindness I don't know whether the pleasing face of my little girl had won his heart or whether the stewardess inferred from Lawyer Hopper's manner that I was a fugitive and had pleaded with him in my behalf When the boat arrived at Stonington the conductor kept his promise and showed us to seats in the first car nearest the engine He asked us to take seats next the door but as he passed through we ventured to move on toward the other end of the car No incivility was offered us and we reached Boston in safety The day after my arrival was one of the happiest of my life I felt as if I was beyond the reach of the bloodhounds and for the first time during many years I had both my children together with me They greatly enjoyed their reunion and laughed and chatted merrily I watched them with a swelling heart Their every motion delighted me I could not feel safe in New York and I accepted the offer of a friend that we should share expenses and keep house together I represented to Mrs Hobbs that Ellen must have some schooling and must remain with me for that purpose She felt ashamed of being unable to read or spell at her age so instead of sending her to school with Benny I instructed her myself till she was fitted to enter an intermediate school The winter passed pleasantly while I was busy with my needle and my children with their books XXXVII A VISIT TO ENGLAND IN the spring sad news came to me Mrs Bruce was dead Never again in this world should I see her gentle face or hear her sympathizing voice I had lost an excellent friend and little Mary had lost a tender mother Mr Bruce wished the child to visit some of her mother's relatives in England and he was desirous that I should take charge of her The little motherless one was accustomed to me and attached to me and I thought she would be happier in my care than in that of a stranger I could also earn more in this way than I could by my needle So I put Benny to a trade and left Ellen to remain in the house with my friend and go to school We sailed from New York and arrived in Liverpool after a pleasant voyage of twelve days We proceeded directly to London and took lodgings at the Adelaide Hotel The supper seemed to me less luxurious than those I had seen in American hotels but my situation was indescribably more pleasant For the first time in my life I was in a place where I was treated according to my deportment without reference to my complexion I felt as if a great millstone had been lifted from my breast Ensconced in a pleasant room with my dear little charge I laid my head on my pillow for the first time with the delightful consciousness of pure unadulterated freedom As I had constant care of the child I had little opportunity to see the wonders of that great city but I watched the tide of life that flowed through the streets and found it a strange contrast to the stagnation in our Southern towns Mr Bruce took his little daughter to spend some days with friends in Oxford Crescent and of course it was necessary for me to accompany her I had heard much of the systematic method of English education and I was very desirous that my dear Mary should steer straight in the midst of so much propriety I closely observed her little playmates and their nurses being ready to take any lessons in the science of good management The children were more rosy than American children but I did not see that they differed materially in other respects They were like all childrensometimes docile and sometimes wayward We next went to Steventon in Berkshire It was a small town said to be the poorest in the county I saw men working in the fields for six shillings and seven shillings a week and women for sixpence and sevenpence a day out of which they boarded themselves Of course they lived in the most primitive manner it could not be otherwise where a woman's wages for an entire day were not sufficient to buy a pound of meat They paid very low rents and their clothes were made of the cheapest fabrics though much better than could have been procured in the United States for the same money I had heard much about the oppression of the poor in Europe The people I saw around me were many of them among the poorest poor But when I visited them in their little thatched cottages I felt that the condition of even the meanest and most ignorant among them was vastly superior to the condition of the most favored slaves in America They labored hard but they were not ordered out to toil while the stars were in the sky and driven and slashed by an overseer through heat and cold till the stars shone out again Their homes were very humble but they were protected by law No insolent patrols could come in the dead of night and flog them at their pleasure The father when he closed his cottage door felt safe with his family around him No master or overseer could come and take from him his wife or his daughter They must separate to earn their living but the parents knew where their children were going and could communicate with them by letters The relations of husband and wife parent and child were too sacred for the richest noble in the land to violate with impunity Much was being done to enlighten these poor people Schools were established among them and benevolent societies were active in efforts to ameliorate their condition There was no law forbidding them to learn to read and write and if they helped each other in spelling out the Bible they were in no danger of thirty-nine lashes as was the case with myself and poor pious old uncle Fred I repeat that the most ignorant and the most destitute of these peasants was a thousand fold better off than the most pampered American slave I do not deny that the poor are oppressed in Europe I am not disposed to paint their condition so rose-colored as the Hon Miss Murray paints the condition of the slaves in the United States A small portion of my experience would enable her to read her own s with anointed eyes If she were to lay aside her title and instead of visiting among the fashionable become domesticated as a poor governess on some plantation in Louisiana or Alabama she would see and hear things that would make her tell quite a different story My visit to England is a memorable event in my life from the fact of my having there received strong religious impressions The contemptuous manner in which the communion had been administered to colored people in my native place the church membership of Dr Flint and others like him and the buying and selling of slaves by professed ministers of the gospel had given me a prejudice against the Episcopal church The whole service seemed to me a mockery and a sham But my home in Steventon was in the family of a clergyman who was a true disciple of Jesus The beauty of his daily life inspired me with faith in the gentleness of Christian professions Grace entered my heart and I knelt at the communion table I trust in true humility of soul I remained abroad ten months which was much longer than I had anticipated During all that time I never saw the slightest symptom of prejudice against color Indeed I entirely forgot it till the time came for us to return to America XXXVIII RENEWED INVITATIONS TO GO SOUTH WE had a tedious winter passage and from the distance spectres seemed to rise up on the shores of the United States It is a sad feeling to be afraid of one's native country We arrived in New York safely and I hastened to Boston to look after my children I found Ellen well and improving at her school but Benny was not there to welcome me He had been left at a good place to learn a trade and for several months every thing worked well He was liked by the master and was a favorite with his fellow apprentices but one day they accidentally discovered a fact they had never before suspectedthat he was colored This at once transformed him into a different being Some of the apprentices were Americans others American-born Irish and it was offensive to their dignity to have a nigger among them after they had been told that he was a nigger They began by treating him with silent scorn and finding that he returned the same they resorted to insults and abuse He was too spirited a boy to stand that and he went off Being desirous to do something to support himself and having no one to advise him he shipped for a whaling voyage When I received these tidings I shed many tears and bitterly reproached myself for having left him so long But I had done it for the best and now all I could do was to pray to the heavenly Father to guide and protect him Not long after my return I received the following letter from Miss Emily Flint now Mrs Dodge In this you will recognize the hand of your friend and mistress Having heard that you had gone with a family to Europe I have waited to hear of your return to write to you I should have answered the letter you wrote to me long since but as I could not then act independently of my father I knew there could be nothing done satisfactory to you There were persons here who were willing to buy you and run the risk of getting you To this I would not consent I have always been attached to you and would not like to see you the slave of another or have unkind treatment I am married now and can protect you My husband expects to move to Virginia this spring where we think of settling I am very anxious that you should come and live with me If you are not willing to come you may purchase yourself but I should prefer having you live with me If you come you may if you like spend a month with your grandmother and friends then come to me in Norfolk Virginia Think this over and write as soon as possible and let me know the conclusion Hoping that your children are well I remain you friend and mistress Of course I did not write to return thanks for this cordial invitation I felt insulted to be thought stupid enough to be caught by such professions 'Come up into my parlor' said the spider to the fly ''Tis the prettiest little parlor that ever you did spy' It was plain that Dr Flint's family were apprised of my movements since they knew of my voyage to Europe I expected to have further trouble from them but having eluded them thus far I hoped to be as successful in future The money I had earned I was desirous to devote to the education of my children and to secure a home for them It seemed not only hard but unjust to pay for myself I could not possibly regard myself as a piece of property Moreover I had worked many years without wages and during that time had been obliged to depend on my grandmother for many comforts in food and clothing My children certainly belonged to me but though Dr Flint had incurred no expense for their support he had received a large sum of money for them I knew the law would decide that I was his property and would probably still give his daughter a claim to my children but I regarded such laws as the regulations of robbers who had no rights that I was bound to respect The Fugitive Slave Law had not then passed The judges of Massachusetts had not then stooped under chains to enter her courts of justice so called I knew my old master was rather skittish of Massachusetts I relied on her love of freedom and felt safe on her soil I am now aware that I honored the old Commonwealth beyond her deserts XXXIX THE CONFESSION FOR two years my daughter and I supported ourselves comfortably in Boston At the end of that time my brother William offered to send Ellen to a boarding school It required a great effort for me to consent to part with her for I had few near ties and it was her presence that made my two little rooms seem home-like But my judgment prevailed over my selfish feelings I made preparations for her departure During the two years we had lived together I had often resolved to tell her something about her father but I had never been able to muster sufficient courage I had a shrinking dread of diminishing my child's love I knew she must have curiosity on the subject but she had never asked a question She was always very careful not to say any thing to remind me of my troubles Now that she was going from me I thought if I should die before she returned she might hear my story from some one who did not understand the palliating circumstances and that if she were entirely ignorant on the subject her sensitive nature might receive a rude shock When we retired for the night she said Mother it is very hard to leave you alone I am almost sorry I am going though I do want to improve myself But you will write to me often won't you mother I did not throw my arms round her I did not anwer her But in a calm solemn way for it cost me great effort I said Listen to me Ellen I have something to tell you I recounted my early sufferings in slavery and told her how nearly they had crushed me I began to tell her how they had driven me into a great sin when she clasped me in her arms and exclaimed O don't mother Please don't tell me any more I said But my child I want you to know about your father I know all about it mother she replied I am nothing to my father and he is nothing to me All my love is for you I was with him five months in Washington and he never cared for me He never spoke to me as he did to his little Fanny I knew all the time he was my father for Fanny's nurse told me so but she said I must never tell any body and I never did I used to wish he would take me in his arms and kiss me as he did Fanny or that he would sometimes smile at me as he did at her I thought if he was my own father he ought to love me I was a little girl then and didn't know any better But now I never think any thing about my father All my love is for you She hugged me closer as she spoke and I thanked God that the knowledge I had so much dreaded to impart had not diminished the affection of my child I had not the slightest idea she knew that portion of my history If I had I should have spoken to her long before for my pent-up feelings had often longed to pour themselves out to some one I could trust But I loved the dear girl better for the delicacy she had manifested towards her unfortunate mother The next morning she and her uncle started on their journey to the village in New York where she was to be placed at school It seemed as if all the sunshine had gone away My little room was dreadfully lonely I was thankful when a message came from a lady accustomed to employ me requesting me to come and sew in her family for several weeks On my return I found a letter from brother William He thought of opening an anti-slavery reading room in Rochester and combining with it the sale of some books and stationery and he wanted me to unite with him We tried it but it was not successful We found warm anti-slavery friends there but the feeling was not general enough to support such an establishment I passed nearly a year in the family of Isaac and Amy Post practical believers in the Christian doctrine of human brotherhood They measured a man's worth by his character not by his complexion The memory of those beloved and honored friends will remain with me to my latest hour XL THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW MY brother being disappointed in his project concluded to go to California and it was agreed that Benjamin should go with him Ellen liked her school and was a great favorite there They did not know her history and she did not tell it because she had no desire to make capital out of their sympathy But when it was accidentally discovered that her mother was a fugitive slave every method was used to increase her advantages and diminish her expenses I was alone again It was necessary for me to be earning money and I preferred that it should be among those who knew me On my return from Rochester I called at the house of Mr Bruce to see Mary the darling little babe that had thawed my heart when it was freezing into a cheerless distrust of all my fellow-beings She was growing a tall girl now but I loved her always Mr Bruce had married again and it was proposed that I should become nurse to a new infant I had but one hesitation and that was my feeling of insecurity in New York now greatly increased by the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law However I resolved to try the experiment I was again fortunate in my employer The new Mrs Bruce was an American brought up under aristocratic influences and still living in the midst of them but if she had any prejudice against color I was never made aware of it and as for the system of slavery she had a most hearty dislike of it No sophistry of Southerners could blind her to its enormity She was a person of excellent principles and a noble heart To me from that hour to the present she has been a true and sympathizing friend Blessings be with her and hers About the time that I rentered the Bruce family an event occurred of disastrous import to the colored people The slave Hamlin the first fugitive that came under the new law was given up by the bloodhounds of the north to the bloodhounds of the south It was the beginning of a reign of terror to the colored population The great city rushed on in its whirl of excitement taking no note of the short and simple annals of the poor But while fashionables were listening to the thrilling voice of Jenny Lind in Metropolitan Hall the thrilling voices of poor hunted colored people went up in an agony of supplication to the Lord from Zion's church Many families who had lived in the city for twenty years fled from it now Many a poor washerwoman who by hard labor had made herself a comfortable home was obliged to sacrifice her furniture bid a hurried farewell to friends and seek her fortune among strangers in Canada Many a wife discovered a secret she had never known beforethat her husband was a fugitive and must leave her to insure his own safety Worse still many a husband discovered that his wife had fled from slavery years ago and as the child follows the condition of its mother the children of his love were liable to be seized and carried into slavery Every where in those humble homes there was consternation and anguish But what cared the legislators of the dominant race for the blood they were crushing out of trampled hearts When my brother William spent his last evening with me before he went to California we talked nearly all the time of the distress brought on our oppressed people by the passage of this iniquitous law and never had I seen him manifest such bitterness of spirit such stern hostility to our oppressors He was himself free from the operation of the law for he did not run from any Slaveholding State being brought into the Free States by his master But I was subject to it and so were hundreds of intelligent and industrious people all around us I seldom ventured into the streets and when it was necessary to do an errand for Mrs Bruce or any of the family I went as much as possible through back streets and by-ways What a disgrace to a city calling itself free that inhabitants guiltless of offence and seeking to perform their duties conscientiously should be condemned to live in such incessant fear and have nowhere to turn for protection This state of things of course gave rise to many impromptu vigilance committees Every colored person and every friend of their persecuted race kept their eyes wide open Every evening I examined the newspapers carefully to see what Southerners had put up at the hotels I did this for my own sake thinking my young mistress and her husband might be among the list I wished also to give information to others if necessary for if many were running to and fro I resolved that knowledge should be increased This brings up one of my Southern reminiscences which I will here briefly relate I was somewhat acquainted with a slave named Luke who belonged to a wealthy man in our vicinity His master died leaving a son and daughter heirs to his large fortune In the division of the slaves Luke was included in the son's portion This young man became a prey to the vices growing out of the patriarchal institution and when he went to the north to complete his education he carried his vices with him He was brought home deprived of the use of his limbs by excessive dissipation Luke was appointed to wait upon his bed-ridden master whose despotic habits were greatly increased by exasperation at his own helplessness He kept a cowhide beside him and for the most trivial occurrence he would order his attendant to bare his back and kneel beside the couch while he whipped him till his strength was exhausted Some days he was not allowed to wear any thing but his shirt in order to be in readiness to be flogged A day seldom passed without his receiving more or less blows If the slightest resistance was offered the town constable was sent for to execute the punishment and Luke learned from experience how much more the constable's strong arm was to be dreaded than the comparatively feeble one of his master The arm of his tyrant grew weak and was finally palsied and then the constable's services were in constant requisition The fact that he was entirely dependent on Luke's care and was obliged to be tended like an infant instead of inspiring any gratitude or compassion towards his poor slave seemed only to increase his irritability and cruelty As he lay there on his bed a mere disgraced wreck of manhood he took into his head the strangest freaks of despotism and if Luke hesitated to submit to his orders the constable was immediately sent for Some of these freaks were of a nature too filthy to be repeated When I fled from the house of bondage I left poor Luke still chained to the bedside of this cruel and disgusting wretch One day when I had been requested to do an errand for Mrs Bruce I was hurrying through back streets as usual when I saw a young man approaching whose face was familiar to me As he came nearer I recognized Luke I always rejoiced to see or hear of any one who had escaped from the black pit but remembering this poor fellow's extreme hardships I was peculiarly glad to see him on Northern soil though I no longer called it free soil I well remembered what a desolate feeling it was to be alone among strangers and I went up to him and greeted him cordially At first he did not know me but when I mentioned my name he remembered all about me I told him of the Fugitive Slave Law and asked him if he did not know that New York was a city of kidnappers He replied De risk ain't so bad for me as 'tis fur you 'Cause I runned away from de speculator and you runned away from de massa Dem speculators vont spen dar money to come here fur a runaway if dey ain't sartin sure to put dar hans right on him An I tell you I's tuk good car 'bout dat I had too hard times down dar to let 'em ketch dis nigger He then told me of the advice he had received and the plans he had laid I asked if he had money enough to take him to Canada 'Pend upon it I hab he replied I tuk car fur dat I'd bin workin all my days fur dem cussed whites an got no pay but kicks and cuffs So I tought dis nigger had a right to money nuff to bring him to de Free States Massa Henry he lib till ebery body vish him dead an ven he did die I knowed de debbil would hab him an vouldn't vant him to bring his money 'long too So I tuk some of his bills and put 'em in de pocket of his ole trousers An ven he was buried dis nigger ask fur dem ole trousers an dey gub 'em to me With a low chuckling laugh he added You see I didn't steal it dey gub it to me I tell you I had mighty hard time to keep de speculator from findin it but he didn't git it This is a fair specimen of how the moral sense is educated by slavery When a man has his wages stolen from him year after year and the laws sanction and enforce the theft how can he be expected to have more regard to honesty than has the man who robs him I have become somewhat enlightened but I confess that I agree with poor ignorant much-abused Luke in thinking he had a right to that money as a portion of his unpaid wages He went to Canada forthwith and I have not since heard from him All that winter I lived in a state of anxiety When I took the children out to breathe the air I closely observed the countenances of all I met I dreaded the approach of summer when snakes and slaveholders make their appearance I was in fact a slave in New York as subject to slave laws as I had been in a Slave State Strange incongruity in a State called free Spring returned and I received warning from the south that Dr Flint knew of my return to my old place and was making preparations to have me caught I learned afterwards that my dress and that of Mrs Bruce's children had been described to him by some of the Northern tools which slaveholders employ for their base purposes and then indulge in sneers at their cupidity and mean servility I immediately informed Mrs Bruce of my danger and she took prompt measures for my safety My place as nurse could not be supplied immediately and this generous sympathizing lady proposed that I should carry her baby away It was a comfort to me to have the child with me for the heart is reluctant to be torn away from every object it loves But how few mothers would have consented to have one of their own babes become a fugitive for the sake of a poor hunted nurse on whom the legislators of the country had let loose the bloodhounds When I spoke of the sacrifice she was making in depriving herself of her dear baby she replied It is better for you to have baby with you Linda for if they get on your track they will be obliged to bring the child to me and then if there is a possibility of saving you you shall be saved This lady had a very wealthy relative a benevolent gentleman in many respects but aristocratic and pro-slavery He remonstrated with her for harboring a fugitive slave told her she was violating the laws of her country and asked her if she was aware of the penalty She replied I am very well aware of it It is imprisonment and one thousand dollars fine Shame on my country that it is so I am ready to incur the penalty I will go to the state's prison rather than have any poor victim torn from my house to be carried back to slavery The noble heart The brave heart The tears are in my eyes while I write of her May the God of the helpless reward her for her sympathy with my persecuted people I was sent into New England where I was sheltered by the wife of a senator whom I shall always hold in grateful remembrance This honorable gentleman would not have voted for the Fugitive Slave Law as did the senator in Uncle Tom's Cabin on the contrary he was strongly opposed to it but he was enough under its influence to be afraid of having me remain in his house many hours So I was sent into the country where I remained a month with the baby When it was supposed that Dr Flint's emissaries had lost track of me and given up the pursuit for the present I returned to New York XLI FREE AT LAST MRS BRUCE and every member of her family were exceedingly kind to me I was thankful for the blessings of my lot yet I could not always wear a cheerful countenance I was doing harm to no one on the contrary I was doing all the good I could in my small way yet I could never go out to breathe God's free air without trepidation at my heart This seemed hard and I could not think it was a right state of things in any civilized country From time to time I received news from my good old grandmother She could not write but she employed others to write for her The following is an extract from one of her last letters Dear Daughter I cannot hope to see you again on earth but I pray to God to unite us above where pain will no more rack this feeble body of mine where sorrow and parting from my children will be no more God has promised these things if we are faithful unto the end My age and feeble health deprive me of going to church now but God is with me here at home Thank your brother for his kindness Give much love to him and tell him to remember the Creator in the days of his youth and strive to meet me in the Father's kingdom Love to Ellen and Benjamin Don't neglect him Tell him for me to be a good boy Strive my child to train them for God's children May he protect and provide for you is the prayer of your loving old mother These letters both cheered and saddened me I was always glad to have tidings from the kind faithful old friend of my unhappy youth but her messages of love made my heart yearn to see her before she died and I mourned over the fact that it was impossible Some months after I returned from my flight to New England I received a letter from her in which she wrote Dr Flint is dead He has left a distressed family Poor old man I hope he made his peace with God I remembered how he had defrauded my grandmother of the hard earnings she had loaned how he had tried to cheat her out of the freedom her mistress had promised her and how he had persecuted her children and I thought to myself that she was a better Christian than I was if she could entirely forgive him I cannot say with truth that the news of my old master's death softened my feelings towards him There are wrongs which even the grave does not bury The man was odious to me while he lived and his memory is odious now His departure from this world did not diminish my danger He had threatened my grandmother that his heirs should hold me in slavery after he was gone that I never should be free so long as a child of his survived As for Mrs Flint I had seen her in deeper afflictions than I supposed the loss of her husband would be for she had buried several children yet I never saw any signs of softening in her heart The doctor had died in embarrassed circumstances and had little to will to his heirs except such property as he was unable to grasp I was well aware what I had to expect from the family of Flints and my fears were confirmed by a letter from the south warning me to be on my guard because Mrs Flint openly declared that her daughter could not afford to lose so valuable a slave as I was I kept close watch of the newspapers for arrivals but one Saturday night being much occupied I forgot to examine the Evening Express as usual I went down into the parlor for it early in the morning and found the boy about to kindle a fire with it I took it from him and examined the list of arrivals Reader if you have never been a slave you cannot imagine the acute sensation of suffering at my heart when I read the names of Mr and Mrs Dodge at a hotel in Courtland Street It was a third-rate hotel and that circumstance convinced me of the truth of what I had heard that they were short of funds and had need of my value as they valued me and that was by dollars and cents I hastened with the paper to Mrs Bruce Her heart and hand were always open to every one in distress and she always warmly sympathized with mine It was impossible to tell how near the enemy was He might have passed and repassed the house while we were sleeping He might at that moment be waiting to pounce upon me if I ventured out of doors I had never seen the husband of my young mistress and therefore I could not distinguish him from any other stranger A carriage was hastily ordered and closely veiled I followed Mrs Bruce taking the baby again with me into exile After various turnings and crossings and returnings the carriage stopped at the house of one of Mrs Bruce's friends where I was kindly received Mrs Bruce returned immediately to instruct the domestics what to say if any one came to inquire for me It was lucky for me that the evening paper was not burned up before I had a chance to examine the list of arrivals It was not long after Mrs Bruce's return to her house before several people came to inquire for me One inquired for me another asked for my daughter Ellen and another said he had a letter from my grandmother which he was requested to deliver in person They were told She has lived here but she has left How long ago I don't know sir Do you know where she went I do not sir And the door was closed This Mr Dodge who claimed me as his property was originally a Yankee pedler in the south then he became a merchant and finally a slaveholder He managed to get introduced into what was called the first society and married Miss Emily Flint A quarrel arose between him and her brother and the brother cowhided him This led to a family feud and he proposed to remove to Virginia Dr Flint left him no property and his own means had become circumscribed while a wife and children depended upon him for support Under these circumstances it was very natural that he should make an effort to put me into his pocket I had a colored friend a man from my native place in whom I had the most implicit confidence I sent for him and told him that Mr and Mrs Dodge had arrived in New York I proposed that he should call upon them to make inquiries about his friends at the south with whom Dr Flint's family were well acquainted He thought there was no impropriety in his doing so and he consented He went to the hotel and knocked at the door of Mr Dodge's room which was opened by the gentleman himself who gruffly inquired What brought you here How came you to know I was in the city Your arrival was published in the evening papers sir and I called to ask Mrs Dodge about my friends at home I didn't suppose it would give any offence Where's that negro girl that belongs to my wife What girl sir You know well enough I mean Linda that ran away from Dr Flint's plantation some years ago I dare say you've seen her and know where she is Yes sir I've seen her and know where she is She is out of your reach sir Tell me where she is or bring her to me and I will give her a chance to buy her freedom I don't think it would be of any use sir I have heard her say she would go to the ends of the earth rather than pay any man or woman for her freedom because she thinks she has a right to it Besides she couldn't do it if she would for she has spent her earnings to educate her children This made Mr Dodge very angry and some high words passed between them My friend was afraid to come where I was but in the course of the day I received a note from him I supposed they had not come from the south in the winter for a pleasure excursion and now the nature of their business was very plain Mrs Bruce came to me and entreated me to leave the city the next morning She said her house was watched and it was possible that some clew to me might be obtained I refused to take her advice She pleaded with an earnest tenderness that ought to have moved me but I was in a bitter disheartened mood I was weary of flying from pillar to post I had been chased during half my life and it seemed as if the chase was never to end There I sat in that great city guiltless of crime yet not daring to worship God in any of the churches I heard the bells ringing for afternoon service and with contemptuous sarcasm I said Will the preachers take for their text 'Proclaim liberty to the captive and the opening of prison doors to them that are bound' or will they preach from the text 'Do unto others as ye would they should do unto you' Oppressed Poles and Hungarians could find a safe refuge in that city John Mitchell was free to proclaim in the City Hall his desire for a plantation well stocked with slaves but there I sat an oppressed American not daring to show my face God forgive the black and bitter thoughts I indulged on that Sabbath day The Scripture says Oppression makes even a wise man mad and I was not wise I had been told that Mr Dodge said his wife had never signed away her right to my children and if he could not get me he would take them This it was more than any thing else that roused such a tempest in my soul Benjamin was with his uncle William in California but my innocent young daughter had come to spend a vacation with me I thought of what I had suffered in slavery at her age and my heart was like a tiger's when a hunter tries to seize her young Dear Mrs Bruce I seem to see the expression of her face as she turned away discouraged by my obstinate mood Finding her expostulations unavailing she sent Ellen to entreat me When ten o'clock in the evening arrived and Ellen had not returned this watchful and unwearied friend became anxious She came to us in a carriage bringing a well-filled trunk for my journeytrusting that by this time I would listen to reason I yielded to her as I ought to have done before The next day baby and I set out in a heavy snow storm bound for New England again I received letters from the City of Iniquity addressed to me under an assumed name In a few days one came from Mrs Bruce informing me that my new master was still searching for me and that she intended to put an end to this persecution by buying my freedom I felt grateful for the kindness that prompted this offer but the idea was not so pleasant to me as might have been expected The more my mind had become enlightened the more difficult it was for me to consider myself an article of property and to pay money to those who had so grievously oppressed me seemed like taking from my sufferings the glory of triumph I wrote to Mrs Bruce thanking her but saying that being sold from one owner to another seemed too much like slavery that such a great obligation could not be easily cancelled and that I preferred to go to my brother in California Without my knowledge Mrs Bruce employed a gentleman in New York to enter into negotiations with Mr Dodge He proposed to pay three hundred dollars down if Mr Dodge would sell me and enter into obligations to relinquish all claim to me or my children forever after He who called himself my master said he scorned so small an offer for such a valuable servant The gentleman replied You can do as you choose sir If you reject this offer you will never get any thing for the woman has friends who will convey her and her children out of the country Mr Dodge concluded that half a loaf was better than no bread and he agreed to the proffered terms By the next mail I received this brief letter from Mrs Bruce I am rejoiced to tell you that the money for your freedom has been paid to Mr Dodge Come home to-morrow I long to see you and my sweet babe My brain reeled as I read these lines A gentleman near me said It's true I have seen the bill of sale The bill of sale Those words struck me like a blow So I was sold at last A human being sold in the free city of New York The bill of sale is on record and future generations will learn from it that women were articles of traffic in New York late in the nineteenth century of the Christian religion It may hereafter prove a useful document to antiquaries who are seeking to measure the progress of civilization in the United States I well know the value of that bit of paper but much as I love freedom I do not like to look upon it I am deeply grateful to the generous friend who procured it but I despise the miscreant who demanded payment for what never rightfully belonged to him or his I had objected to having my freedom bought yet I must confess that when it was done I felt as if a heavy load had been lifted from my weary shoulders When I rode home in the cars I was no longer afraid to unveil my face and look at people as they passed I should have been glad to have met Daniel Dodge himself to have had him seen me and known me that he might have mourned over the untoward circumstances which compelled him to sell me for three hundred dollars When I reached home the arms of my benefactress were thrown round me and our tears mingled As soon as she could speak she said O Linda I'm so glad it's all over You wrote to me as if you thought you were going to be transferred from one owner to another But I did not buy you for your services I should have done just the same if you had been going to sail for California to-morrow I should at least have the satisfaction of knowing that you left me a free woman My heart was exceedingly full I remembered how my poor father had tried to buy me when I was a small child and how he had been disappointed I hoped his spirit was rejoicing over me now I remembered how my good old grandmother had laid up her earnings to purchase me in later years and how often her plans had been frustrated How that faithful loving old heart would leap for joy if she could look on me and my children now that we were free My relatives had been foiled in all their efforts but God had raised me up a friend among strangers who had bestowed on me the precious long-desired boon Friend It is a common word often lightly used Like other good and beautiful things it may be tarnished by careless handling but when I speak of Mrs Bruce as my friend the word is sacred My grandmother lived to rejoice in my freedom but not long after a letter came with a black seal She had gone where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest Time passed on and a paper came to me from the south containing an obituary notice of my uncle Phillip It was the only case I ever knew of such an honor conferred upon a colored person It was written by one of his friends and contained these words Now that death has laid him low they call him a good man and a useful citizen but what are eulogies to the black man when the world has faded from his vision It does not require man's praise to obtain rest in God's kingdom So they called a colored man a citizen Strange words to be uttered in that region Reader my story ends with freedom not in the usual way with marriage I and my children are now free We are as free from the power of slaveholders as are the white people of the north and though that according to my ideas is not saying a great deal it is a vast improvement in my condition The dream of my life is not yet realized I do not sit with my children in a home of my own I still long for a hearthstone of my own however humble I wish it for my children's sake far more than for my own But God so orders circumstances as to keep me with my friend Mrs Bruce Love duty gratitude also bind me to her side It is a privilege to serve her who pities my oppressed people and who has bestowed the inestimable boon of freedom on me and my children It has been painful to me in many ways to recall the dreary years I passed in bondage I would gladly forget them if I could Yet the retrospection is not altogether without solace for with those gloomy recollections come tender memories of my good old grandmother like light fleecy clouds floating over a dark and troubled sea APPENDIX THE following statement is from Amy Post a member of the Society of Friends in the State of New York well known and highly respected by friends of the poor and the oppressed As has been already stated in the preceding s the author of this volume spent some time under her hospitable roof L M C The author of this book is my highly-esteemed friend If its readers knew her as I know her they could not fail to be deeply interested in her story She was a beloved inmate of our family nearly the whole of the year She was introduced to us by her affectionate and conscientious brother who had previously related to us some of the almost incredible events in his sister's life I immediately became much interested in Linda for her appearance was prepossessing and her deportment indicated remarkable delicacy of feeling and purity of thought As we became acquainted she related to me from time to time some of the incidents in her bitter experiences as a slave-woman Though impelled by a natural craving for human sympathy she passed through a baptism of suffering even in recounting her trials to me in private confidential conversations The burden of these memories lay heavily upon her spiritnaturally virtuous and refined I repeatedly urged her to consent to the publication of her narrative for I felt that it would arouse people to a more earnest work for the disinthralment of millions still remaining in that soul-crushing condition which was so unendurable to her But her sensitive spirit shrank from publicity She said 'You know a woman can whisper her cruel wrongs in the ear of a dear friend much easier than she can record them for the world to read' Even in talking with me she wept so much and seemed to suffer such mental agony that I felt her story was too sacred to be drawn from her by inquisitive questions and I left her free to tell as much or as little as she chose Still I urged upon her the duty of publishing her experience for the sake of the good it might do and at last she undertook the task Having been a slave so large a portion of her life she is unlearned she is obliged to earn her living by her own labor and she has worked untiringly to procure education for her children several times she has been obliged to leave her employments in order to fly from the man-hunters and woman-hunters of our land but she pressed through all these obstacles and overcame them After the labors of the day were over she traced secretly and wearily by the midnight lamp a truthful record of her eventful life This Empire State is a shabby place of refuge for the oppressed but here through anxiety turmoil and despair the freedom of Linda and her children was finally secured by the exertions of a generous friend She was grateful for the boon but the idea of having been bought was always galling to a spirit that could never acknowledge itself to be a chattel She wrote to us thus soon after the event 'I thank you for your kind expressions in regard to my freedom but the freedom I had before the money was paid was dearer to me God gave me that freedom but man put God's image in the scales with the paltry sum of three hundred dollars I served for my liberty as faithfully as Jacob served for Rachel At the end he had large possessions but I was robbed of my victory I was obliged to resign my crown to rid myself of a tyrant' Her story as written by herself cannot fail to interest the reader It is a sad illustration of the condition of this country which boasts of its civilization while it sanctions laws and customs which make the experiences of the present more strange than any fictions of the past AMY POST ROCHESTER N Y Oct th The following is from a man who is now a highly respectable colored citizen of Boston LMC This narrative contains some incidents so extraordinary that doubtless many persons under whose eyes it may chance to fall will be ready to believe that it is colored highly to serve a special purpose But however it may be regarded by the incredulous I know that it is full of living truths I have been well acquainted with the author from my boyhood The circumstances recounted in her history are perfectly familiar to me I knew of her treatment from her master of the imprisonment of her children of their sale and redemption of her seven years' concealment and of her subsequent escape to the North I am now a resident of Boston and am a living witness to the truth of this interesting narrative GEORGE W LOWTHER 
Old-Elizabeth,MEMOIR OF OLD ELIZABETH A COLOURED WOMAN There is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus GAL iii PHILADELPHIA COLLINS PRINTER JAYNE STREET MEMOIR C In the following Narrative of OLD ELIZABETH which was taken mainly from her own lips in her th year her simple language has been adhered to as strictly as was consistent with perspicuity and propriety I was born in Maryland in the year My parents were slaves Both my father and mother were religious people and belonged to the Methodist Society It was my father's practice to read in the Bible aloud to his children every sabbath morning At these seasons when I was but five years old I often felt the overshadowing of the Lord's Spirit without at all understanding what it meant and these incomes and influences continued to attend me until I was eleven years old particularly when I was alone by which I was preserved from doing anything that I thought was wrong In the eleventh year of my age my master sent me to another farm several miles from my parents brothers and sisters which was a great trouble to me At last I grew so lonely and sad I thought I should die if I did not see my mother I asked the overseer if I might go but being positively denied I concluded to go without his knowledge When I reached home my mother was away I set off and walked twenty miles before I found her I staid with her for several days and we returned together Next day I was sent back to my new place which renewed my sorrow At parting my mother told me that I had nobody in the wide world to look to but God These words fell upon my heart with pondrous weight and seemed to add to my grief I went back repeating as I went none but God in the wide world On reaching the farm I found the overseer was displeased at me for going without his liberty He tied me with a rope and gave me some stripes of which I carried the marks for weeks After this time finding as my mother I had none in the world to look to but God I betook myself to prayer and in every lonely place I found an altar I mourned sore like a dove and chattered forth my sorrow moaning in the corners of the field and under the fences I continued in this state for about six months feeling as though my head were waters and I could do nothing but weep I lost my appetite and not being able to take enough food to sustain nature I became so weak I had but little strength to work still I was required to do all my duty One evening after the duties of the day were ended I thought I could not live over the night so threw myself on a bench expecting to die and without being prepared to meet my Maker and my spirit cried within me must I die in this state and be banished from Thy presence forever I own I am a sinner in Thy sight and not fit to live where thou art Still it was my fervent desire that the Lord would pardon me Just at this season I saw with my spiritual eye an awful gulf of misery As I thought I was about to plunge into it I heard a voice saying rise up and pray which strengthened me I fell on my knees and prayed the best I could the Lord's prayer Knowing no more to say I halted but continued on my knees My spirit was then taught to pray Lord have mercy on me Christ save me Immediately there appeared a director clothed in white raiment I thought he took me by the hand and come with me He led me down a long journey to a fiery gulf and left me standing upon the brink of this awful pit I began to scream for mercy thinking I was about to be plunged to the belly of hell and believed I should sink to endless ruin Although I prayed and wrestled with all my might it seemed in vain Still I felt all the while that I was sustained by some invisible power At this solemn moment I thought I saw a hand from which hung as it were a silver hair and a voice told me that all the hope I had of being saved was no more than a hair still pray and it will be sufficient I then renewed my struggle crying for mercy and salvation until I found that every cry raised me higher and higher and my head was quite above the fiery pillars Then I thought I was permitted to look straight forward and saw the Saviour standing with His hand stretched out to receive me An indescribably glorious light was in Him and He peace peace come unto me At this moment I felt that my sins were forgiven me and the time of my deliverance was at hand I sprang forward and fell at his feet giving Him all the thanks and highest praises crying Thou hast redeemed me Thou hast redeemed me to thyself I felt filled with light and love At this moment I thought my former guide took me again by the hand and led me upward till I came to the celestial world and to heaven's door which I saw was open and while I stood there a power surrounded me which drew me in and I saw millions of glorified spirits in white robes After I had this view I thought I heard a voice saying Art thou willing to be saved I Yes Lord Again I was asked Art thou willing to be saved in my way I stood speechless until he asked me again Art thou willing to be saved in my way Then I heard a whispering voice say If thou art not saved in the Lord's way thou canst not be saved at all at which I exclaimed Yes Lord in thy own way Immediately a light fell upon my head and I was filled with light and I was shown the world lying in wickedness and was told I must go there and call the people to repentance for the day of the Lord was at hand and this message was as a heavy yoke upon me so that I wept bitterly at the thought of what I should have to pass through While I wept I heard a voice say weep not some will laugh at thee some will scoff at thee and the dogs will bark at thee but while thou doest my will I will be with thee to the ends of the earth I was at this time not yet thirteen years old The next day when I had come to myself I felt like a new creature in Christ and all my desire was to see the Saviour I lived in a place where there was no preaching and no religious instruction but every day I went out amongst the hay stacks where the presence of the Lord overshadowed me and I was filled with sweetness and joy and was as a vessel filled with holy oil In this way I continued for about a year many times while my hands were at my work my spirit was carried away to spiritual things One day as I was going to my old place behind the hay stacks to pray I was assailed with this language Are you going there to weep and pray what a fool there are older professors than you are and they do not take that way to get to heaven people whose sins are forgiven ought to be joyful and lively and not be struggling and praying With this I halted and concluded I would not go but do as other professors did and so went off to play but at this moment the light that was in me became darkened and the peace and joy that I once had departed from me About this time I was moved back to the farm where my mother lived and then sold to a stranger Here I had deep sorrows and plungings not having experienced a return of that sweet evidence and light with which I had been favoured formerly but by watching unto prayer and wrestling mightily with the Lord my peace gradually returned and with it a great exercise and weight upon my heart for the salvation of my fellow creatures and I was often carried to distant lands and shown places where I should have to travel and deliver the Lord's message Years afterwards I found myself visiting those towns and countries that I had seen in the light as I sat it home at my sewing places of which I had never heard Some years from this time I was sold to a Presbyterian for a term of years as he did not think it right to hold slaves for life Having served him faithfully my time out he gave me my liberty which was about the thirtieth year of my age As I now lived in a neighborhood where I could attend religious meetings occasionally I felt moved to speak a few words therein but I shrank from it so great was the cross to my nature I did not speak much till I had reached my forty second year when it was revealed to me that the message which had been given to me I had not yet delivered and the time had come As I could read but little I questioned within myself how it would be possible for me to deliver the message when I did not understand the Scriptures Whereupon I was moved to open a Bible that was near me which I did and my eyes fell upon this passage Gird up thy loins now like a man and answer thou me Obey God rather than man c Here I fell into a great exercise of spirit and was plunged very low I went from one religious professor to another enquiring of them what ailed me but of all these I could find none who could throw any light upon such impressions They all told me there was nothing in Scripture that would sanction such exercises It was hard for men to travel and what would women do These things greatly discouraged me and shut up my way and caused me to resist the Spirit After going to all that were accounted pious and receiving no help I returned to the Lord feeling that I was nothing and knew nothing and wrestled and prayed to the Lord that he would fully reveal His will and make the way plain Whilst I thus struggled there seemed a light from heaven to fall upon me which banished all my desponding fears and I was enabled to form a new resolution to go on to prison and to death if it might be my portion and the Lord showed me that it was His will I should be resigned to die any death that might be my lot in carrying his message and be entirely crucified to the world and sacrifice all to His glory that was then in my possession which His witnesses the holy Apostles had done before me It was then revealed to me that the Lord had given me the evidence of a clean heart in which I could rejoice day and night and I walked and talked with God and my soul was illuminated with heavenly light and I knew nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified One day after those things while I was at my work the Spirit directed me to go to a poor widow and ask her if I might have a meeting at her house which was situated in one of the lowest and worst streets in Baltimore With great joy she gave notice and at the time appointed I appeared there among a few coloured sisters When they had all prayed they called upon me to close the meeting and I felt an impression that I must say a few words and while I was speaking the house seemed filled with light and when I was about to close the meeting and was kneeling a man came in and stood till I arose It proved to be a watchman The sisters became so frightened they all went away except the one who lived in the house and an old woman they both appeared to be much frightened fearing they should receive some personal injury or be put out of the house A feeling of weakness came over me for a short time but I soon grew warm and courageous in the Spirit The man then to me I was sent here to break up your meeting Complaint has been made to me that the people round here cannot sleep for the racket I replied a good racket is better than a bad racket How do they rest when the ungodly are dancing and fiddling till midnight Why are not they molested by the watchmen and why should we be for praising God our Maker Are we worthy of greater punishment for praying to Him and are we to be prohibited from doing so that sinners may remain slumbering in their sins While speaking these few words I grew warm with heavenly zeal and laid my hand upon him and addressed him with gospel truth how do sinners sleep in hell after slumbering in their sins here and crying 'let me rest let me rest ' while sporting on the very brink of hell Is the cause of God to be destroyed for this purpose Speaking several words more to this amount he turned pale and trembled and begged my pardon acknowledging that it was not his wish to interrupt us and that he would never disturb a religious assembly again He then took leave of me in a comely manner and wished us success After he was gone I turned to the old sisters who by this time were quite cheered up You see I if the sisters had not fled what a victory we might have had on the Lord's side for the man seemed ready to give up under conviction If it had not been for their cowardice we might have all bowed in prayer and a shout of victory had been heard amongst us Our meeting gave great offence and we were forbid holding any more assemblies Even the elders of our meeting joined with the wicked people and such meetings must be stopped and that woman quieted But I was not afraid of any of them and continued to go and burnt with a zeal not my own The old sisters were zealous sometimes and at other times would sink under the cross Thus they grow cold at which I was much grieved I proposed to them to ask the elders to send a brother which was concluded upon We went on for several years and the Lord was with us with great power it proved to the conversion of many souls and we continued to grow stronger I felt at times that I must exercise in the ministry but when I rose upon my feet I felt ashmed and so I went under a cloud for some time and endeavoured to keep silence but I could not quench the Spirit I was rejected by the elders and rulers as Christ was rejected by the Jews before me and while others were excused in crimes of the darkest dye I was hunted down in every place where I appointed a meeting Wading through many sorrows I thought at times I might as well be banished from this life as to feel the Almighty drawing me one way and man another so that I was tempted to cast myself into the dock But contemplating the length of eternity and how long my sufferings would be in that unchangeable world compared with this if I endured a little longer the Lord was pleased to deliver me from this gloomy melancholy state in his own time though while this temptation lasted I roved up and down and talked and prayed I often felt that I was unfit to assemble with the congregation with whom I had gathered and had sometimes been made to rejoice in the Lord I felt that I was despised on account of this gracious calling and was looked upon as a speckled bird by the ministers to whom I looked for instruction and to whom I resorted every opportunity for the same but when I would converse with them some would cry out You are an enthusiast and others the Discipline did not allow of any such division of the work until I began to think I surely must be wrong Under this reflection I had another gloomy cloud to struggle through but after awhile I felt much moved upon by the Spirit of the Lord and meeting with an aged sister I found upon conversing with her that she could sympathize with me in this spiritual work She was the first one I had met with who could fully understand my exercises She offered to open her house for a meeting and run the risk of all the church would do to her for it Many were afraid to open their houses in this way lest they should be turned out of the church I persevered notwithstanding the opposition of those who were looked upon as higher and wiser The meeting was appointed and but few came I felt much backwardness and as though I could not pray but a pressure upon me to arise and express myself by way of exhortation After hesitating for some time whether I would take up the cross or no I arose and after expressing a few words the Spirit came upon me with life and a victory was gained over the power of darkness and we could rejoice together in His love As for myself I was so full I hardly knew whether I was in the body or out of the body so great was my joy for the victory on the Lord's side But the persecution against me increased and a complaint was carried forward as was done formerly against Daniel the servant of God and the elders came out with indignation for my holding meetings contrary to discipline being a woman Thus we see when the heart is not inspired and the inward eye enlightened by the Spirit we are incapable of discerning the mystery of God in these things Individuals creep into the church that are unregenerate and after they have been there awhile they fancy that they have got the grace of God while they are destitute of it They may have a degree of light in their heads but evil in their hearts which makes them think they are qualified to be judges of the ministry and their conceit makes them very busy in matters of religion judging of the revelations that are given to others while they have received none themselves Being thus mistaken they are calculated to make a great deal of confusion in the church and clog the true ministry These are they who eat their own bread and wear their own apparel having the form of godliness but are destitute of the power Again I felt encouraged to attend another and another appointment At one of these meetings some of the class leaders were present who were constrained to cry out Surely the Lord has revealed these things to her and asked one another if they ever heard the like I look upon man as a very selfish being when placed in a religious office to presume to resist the work of the Almighty because He does not work by man's authority I did not faint under discouragement but pressed on Under the contemplation of these things I slept but little being much engaged in receiving the revelations of the Divine will concerning this work and the mysterious call thereto I felt very unworthy and small notwithstanding the Lord had shown himself with great power insomuch that conjecturers and critics were constrained to join in praise to his great name for truly we had times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord At one of the meetings a vast number of the white inhabitants of the place and many coloured people attended many no doubt from curiosity to hear what the old coloured woman had to say One a great scripturian fixed himself behind the door with pen and ink in order to take down the discourse in short hand but the Almighty Being anointed me with such a portion of his Spirit that he cast away his paper and pen and heard the discourse with patience and was much affected for the Lord wrought powerfully on his heart After meeting he came forward and offered me his hand with solemnity on his countenance and handed me something to pay for my conveyance home I returned much strengthened by the Lord's power to go on to the fulfilment of His work although I was again pressed by the authorities of the church to which I belonged for imprudency and so much condemned that I was sorely tempted by the enemy to turn aside into the wilderness I was so embarrassed and encompassed I wondered within myself whether all that were called to be mouth piece for the Lord suffered such deep wadings as I experienced I now found I had to travel still more extensively in the work of the ministry and I applied to the Lord for direction I was often invited to go hither and thither but felt that I must wait for the dictates of His Spirit At a meeting which I held in Maryland I was led to speak from the passage Woe to the rebellious city c After the meeting the people came where I was to take me before the squire but the Lord delivered me from their hands I also held meetings in Virginia The people there would not believe that a coloured woman could preach And moreover as she had no learning they strove to imprison me because I spoke against slavery and being brought up they asked by what authority I spake and if I had been ordained I answered not by the commission of men's hands if the Lord had ordained me I needed nothing better As I travelled along through the land I was led at different times to converse with white men who were by profession ministers of the gospel Many of them up and down confessed they did not believe in revelation which gave me to see that men were sent forth as ministers without Christ's authority In a conversation with one of these he You think you have these things by revelation but there has been no such thing as revelation since Christ's ascension I asked him where the apostle John got his revelation while he was in the Isle of Patmos With this he rose up and left me and I in my spirit get thee behind me Satan I visited many remote places where there were no meeting houses and held many glorions meetings for the Lord poured out his Spirit in sweet effusions I also travelled in Canada and visited several settlements of coloured people and felt an open door amongst them I may here remark that while journeying through the different states of the Union I met with many of the Quaker Friends and visited them in their families I received much kindness and sympathy and no opposition from them in the prosecution of my labours On one occasion in a thinly settled part of the country seeing a Friend's meeting house open I went in at the same time a Friend and his little daughter followed me We three composed the meeting As we sat there in silence I felt a remarkable overshadowing of the Divine presence as much so as I ever experienced any where Toward the close a few words seemed to be given me which I expressed and left the place greatly refreshed in Spirit From thence I went to Michigan where I found a wide field of labour amongst my own colour Here I remained four years I established a school for coloured orphans having always felt the great importance of the religious and moral agriculture of children and the great need of it especially amongst the coloured people Having white teachers I met with much encouragement My eighty seventh year had now arrived when suffering from disease and feeling released from travelling further in my good Master's cause I came on to Philadelphia where I have remained until this time which brings me to my ninety seventh year When I went forth it was without purse or scrip and I have come through great tribulation and temptation not by any might of my own for I feel that I am but as dust and ashes before my almighty Helper who has according to His promise been with me and sustained me through all and gives me now firm faith that he will be with me to the end and in his own good time receive me into His everlasting rest 
William-Ellen,RUNNING A THOUSAND MILES FOR FREEDOM OR THE ESCAPE OF WILLIAM AND ELLEN CRAFT FROM SLAVERY Slaves cannot breathe in England if their lungs Receive our air that moment they are free They touch our country and their shackles fall COWPER LONDON WILLIAM TWEEDIE STRAND verso LONDON RICHARD BARRETT PRINTER MARK LANE iii PREFACE HAVING heard while in Slavery that God made of one blood all nations of men and also that the American Declaration of Independence says that We hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness we could not understand by what right we were held as chattels Therefore we felt perfectly justified in undertaking the dangerous and exciting task of running a thousand miles in order to obtain those rights which are so vividly set forth in the Declaration I beg those who would know the particulars of our journey to peruse these s This book is not intended as a full history of the iv life of my wife nor of myself but merely as an account of our escape together with other matter which I hope may be the means of creating in some minds a deeper abhorrence of the sinful and abominable practice of enslaving and brutifying our fellowcreatures Without stopping to write a long apology for offering this little volume to the public I shall commence at once to pursue my simple story W CRAFT CAMBRIDGE ROAD HAMMERSMITH LONDON RUNNING A THOUSAND MILES FOR FREEDOM PART I God gave us only over beast fish fowl Dominion absolute that right we hold By his donation But man over man He made not lord such title to himself Reserving human left from human free MILTON MY wife and myself were born in different towns in the State of Georgia which is one of the principal slave States It is true our condition as slaves was not by any means the worst but the mere idea that we were held as chattels and deprived of all legal rightsthe thought that we had to give up our hard earnings to a tyrant to enable him to live in idleness and luxurythe thought that we could not call the bones and sinews that God gave us our own but above all the fact that another man had the power to tear from our cradle the newborn babe and sell it in the shambles like a brute and then scourge us if we dared to lift a finger to save it from such a fate haunted us for years But in December a plan suggested itself that proved quite successful and in eight days after it was first thought of we were free from the horrible trammels of slavery rejoicing and praising God in the glorious sunshine of liberty My wife's first master was her father and her mother his slave and the latter is still the slave of his widow Notwithstanding my wife being of African extraction on her mother's side she is almost whitein fact she is so nearly so that the tyrannical old lady to whom she first belonged became so annoyed at finding her frequently mistaken for a child of the family that she gave her when eleven years of age to a daughter as a wedding present This separated my wife from her mother and also from several other dear friends But the incessant cruelty of her old mistress made the change of owners or treatment so desirable that she did not grumble much at this cruel separation It may be remembered that slavery in America is not at all confined to persons of any particular complexion there are a very large number of slaves as white as any one but as the evidence of a slave is not admitted in court against a free white person it is almost impossible for a white child after having been kidnapped and sold into or reduced to slavery in a part of the country where it is not known as often is the case ever to recover its freedom I have myself conversed with several slaves who told me that their parents were white and free but that they were stolen away from them and sold when quite young As they could not tell their address and also as the parents did not know what had become of their lost and dear little ones of course all traces of each other were gone The following facts are sufficient to prove that he who has the power and is inhuman enough to trample upon the sacred rights of the weak cares nothing for race or colour In March three ships arrived at New Orleans bringing several hundred German emigrants from the province of Alsace on the lower Rhine Among them were Daniel Muller and his two daughters Dorothea and Salom whose mother had died on the passage Soon after his arrival Muller taking with him his two daughters both young children went up the river to Attakapas parish to work on the plantation of John F Miller A few weeks later his relatives who had remained at New Orleans learned that he had died of the fever of the country They immediately sent for the two girls but they had disappeared and the relatives notwithstanding repeated and persevering inquiries and researches could find no traces of them They were at length given up for dead Dorothea was never again heard of nor was any thing known of Salom from till In the summer of that year Madame Karl a German woman who had come over in the same ship with the Mullers was passing through a street in New Orleans and accidentally saw Salom in a wineshop belonging to Louis Belmonte by whom she was held as a slave Madame Karl recognised her at once and carried her to the house of another German woman Mrs Schubert who was Salom's cousin and godmother and who no sooner set eyes on her than without having any intimation that the discovery had been previously made she unhesitatingly exclaimed My God here is the longlost Salom Muller The Law Reporter in its account of this case says As many of the German emigrants of as could be gathered together were brought to the house of Mrs Schubert and every one of the number who had any recollection of the little girl upon the passage or any acquaintance with her father and mother immediately identified the woman before them as the longlost Salom Muller By all these witnesses who appeared at the trial the identity was fully established The family resemblance in every feature was declared to be so remarkable that some of the witnesses did not hesitate to say that they should know her among ten thousand that they were as certain the plaintiff was Salom Muller the daughter of Daniel and Dorothea Muller as of their own existence Among the witnesses who appeared in Court was the midwife who had assisted at the birth of Salom She testified to the existence of certain peculiar marks upon the body of the child which were found exactly as described by the surgeons who were appointed by the Court to make an examination for the purpose There was no trace of African descent in any feature of Salom Muller She had long straight black hair hazel eyes thin lips and a Roman nose The complexion of her face and neck was as dark as that of the darkest brunette It appears however that during the twentyfive years of her servitude she had been exposed to the sun's rays in the hot climate of Louisiana with head and neck unsheltered as is customary with the female slaves while labouring in the cotton or the sugar field Those parts of her person which had been shielded from the sun were comparatively white Belmonte the pretended owner of the girl had obtained possession of her by an act of sale from John F Miller the planter in whose service Salom's father died This Miller was a man of consideration and substance owning large sugar estates and bearing a high reputation for honour and honesty and for indulgent treatment of his slaves It was testified on the trial that he had to Belmonte a few weeks after the sale of Salom that she was white and had as much right to her freedom as any one and was only to be retained in slavery by care and kind treatment The broker who negotiated the sale from Miller to Belmonte in testified in Court that he then thought and still thought that the girl was white The case was elaborately argued on both sides but was at length decided in favour of the girl by the Supreme Court declaring that she was free and white and therefore unlawfully held in bondage The Rev George Bourne of Virginia in his Picture of Slavery published in relates the case of a white boy who at the age of seven was stolen from his home in Ohio tanned and stained in such a way that he could not be distinguished from a person of colour and then sold as a slave in Virginia At the age of twenty he made his escape by running away and happily succeeded in rejoining his parents I have known worthless white people to sell their own free children into slavery and as there are goodfornothing white as well as coloured persons everywhere no one perhaps will wonder at such inhuman transactions particularly in the Southern States of America where I believe there is a greater want of humanity and high principle amongst the whites than among any other civilized people in the world I know that those who are not familiar with the working of the peculiar institution can scarcely imagine any one so totally devoid of all natural affection as to sell his own offspring into returnless bondage But Shakspeare that great observer of human nature says With caution judge of probabilities Things deemed unlikely e'en impossible Experience often shows us to be true My wife's new mistress was decidedly more humane than the majority of her class My wife has always given her credit for not exposing her to many of the worst features of slavery For instance it is a common practice in the slave States for ladies when angry with their maids to send them to the calybuce sugarhouse or to some other place established for the purpose of punishing slaves and have them severely flogged and I am sorry it is a fact that the villains to whom those defenceless creatures are sent not only flog them as they are ordered but frequently compel them to submit to the greatest indignity Oh if there is any one thing under the wide canopy of heaven horrible enough to stir a man's soul and to make his very blood boil it is the thought of his dear wife his unprotected sister or his young and virtuous daughters struggling to save themselves from falling a prey to such demons It always appears strange to me that any one who was not born a slaveholder and steeped to the very core in the demoralizing atmosphere of the Southern States can in any way palliate slavery It is still more surprising to see virtuous ladies looking with patience upon and remaining indifferent to the existence of a system that exposes nearly two millions of their own sex in the manner I have mentioned and that too in a professedly free and Christian country There is however great consolation in knowing that God is just and will not let the oppressor of the weak and the spoiler of the virtuous escape unpunished here and hereafter I believe a similar retribution to that which destroyed Sodom is hanging over the slaveholders My sincere prayer is that they may not provoke God by persisting in a reckless course of wickedness to pour out his consuming wrath upon them I must now return to our history My old master had the reputation of being a very humane and Christian man but he thought nothing of selling my poor old father and dear aged mother at separate times to different persons to be dragged off never to behold each other again till summoned to appear before the great tribunal of heaven But oh what a happy meeting it will be on that great day for those faithful souls I say a happy meeting because I never saw persons more devoted to the service of God than they But how will the case stand with those reckless traffickers in human flesh and blood who plunged the poisonous dagger of separation into those loving hearts which God had for so many years closely joined togethernay sealed as it were with his own hands for the eternal courts of heaven It is not for me to say what will become of those heartless tyrants I must leave them in the hands of an allwise and just God who will in his own good time and in his own way avenge the wrongs of his oppressed people My old master also sold a dear brother and a sister in the same manner as he did my father and mother The reason he assigned for disposing of my parents as well as of several other aged slaves was that they were getting old and would soon become valueless in the market and therefore he intended to sell off all the old stock and buy in a young lot A most disgraceful conclusion for a man to come to who made such great professions of religion This shameful conduct gave me a thorough hatred not for true Christianity but for slaveholding piety My old master then wishing to make the most of the rest of his slaves apprenticed a brother and myself out to learn trades he to a blacksmith and myself to a cabinetmaker If a slave has a good trade he will let or sell for more than a person without one and many slaveholders have their slaves taught trades on this account But before our time expired my old master wanted money so he sold my brother and then mortgaged my sister a dear girl about fourteen years of age and myself then about sixteen to one of the banks to get money to speculate in cotton This we knew nothing of at the moment but time rolled on the money became due my master was unable to meet his payments so the bank had us placed upon the auction stand and sold to the highest bidder My poor sister was sold first she was knocked down to a planter who resided at some distance in the country Then I was called upon the stand While the auctioneer was crying the bids I saw the man that had purchased my sister getting her into a cart to take her to his home I at once asked a slave friend who was standing near the platform to run and ask the gentleman if he would please to wait till I was sold in order that I might have an opportunity of bidding her goodbye He sent me word back that he had some distance to go and could not wait I then turned to the auctioneer fell upon my knees and humbly prayed him to let me just step down and bid my last sister farewell But instead of granting me this request he grasped me by the neck and in a commanding tone of voice and with a violent oath exclaimed Get up You can do the wench no good therefore there is no use in your seeing her On rising I saw the cart in which she sat moving slowly off and as she clasped her hands with a grasp that indicated despair and looked pitifully round towards me I also saw the large silent tears trickling down her cheeks She made a farewell bow and buried her face in her lap This seemed more than I could bear It appeared to swell my aching heart to its utmost But before I could fairly recover the poor girl was gonegone and I have never had the good fortune to see her from that day to this Perhaps I should have never heard of her again had it not been for the untiring efforts of my good old mother who became free a few years ago by purchase and after a great deal of difficulty found my sister residing with a family in Mississippi My mother at once wrote to me informing me of the fact and requesting me to do something to get her free and I am happy to say that partly by lecturing occasionally and through the sale of an engraving of my wife in the disguise in which she escaped together with the extreme kindness and generosity of Miss Burdett Coutts Mr George Richardson of Plymouth and a few other friends I have nearly accomplished this It would be to me a great and everglorious achievement to restore my sister to our dear mother from whom she was forcibly driven in early life I was knocked down to the cashier of the bank to which we were mortgaged and ordered to return to the cabinet shop where I previously worked But the thought of the harsh auctioneer not allowing me to bid my dear sister farewell sent redhot indignation darting like lighting through every vein It quenched my tears and appeared to set my brain on fire and made me crave for power to avenge our wrongs But alas we were only slaves and had no legal rights consequently we were compelled to smother our wounded feelings and crouch beneath the iron heel of despotism I must now give the account of our escape but before doing so it may be well to quote a few passages from the fundamental laws of slavery in order to give some idea of the legal as well as the social tyranny from which we fled According to the law of Louisiana A slave is one who is in the power of a master to whom he belongs The master may sell him dispose of his person his industry and his labour he can do nothing possess nothing nor acquire anything but what must belong to his master Civil Code art In South Carolina it is expressed in the following languageSlaves shall be deemed sold taken reputed and judged in law to be chattels personal in the hands of their owners and possessors and their executors administrators and assigns to all intents constructions and purposes whatsoever Brevard's Digest The Constitution of Georgia has the following Art sec Any person who shall maliciously dismember or deprive a slave of life shall suffer such punishment as would be inflicted in case the like offence had been committed on a free white person and on the like proof except in case of insurrection of such slave and unless SUCH DEATH SHOULD HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT IN GIVING SUCH SLAVE MODERATE CORRECTIONPrince's Digest I have known slaves to be beaten to death but as they died under moderate correction it was quite lawful and of course the murderers were not interfered with If any slave who shall be out of the house or plantation where such slave shall live or shall be usually employed or without some white person in company with such slave shall refuse to submit to undergo the examination of any white person let him be ever so drunk or crazy it shall be lawful for such white person to pursue apprehend and moderately correct such slave and if such slave shall assault and strike such white person such slave may be lawfully killed Brevard's Digest Provided always says the law that such striking be not done by the command and in the defence of the person or property of the owner or other person having the government of such slave in which case the slave shall be wholly excused According to this law if a slave by the direction of overseer strike a white person who is beating overseer's pig the slave shall be wholly excused But should the bondman of his own accord fight to defend his wife or should his terrified daughter instinctively raise her hand and strike the wretch who attempts to violate her chastity he or she shall saith the model republican law suffer death From having been myself a slave for nearly twentythree years I am quite prepared to say that the practical working of slavery is worse than the odious laws by which it is governed At an early age we were taken by the persons who held us as property to Macon the largest town in the interior of the State of Georgia at which place we became acquainted with each other for several years before our marriage in fact our marriage was postponed for some time simply because one of the unjust and worse than Pagan laws under which we lived compelled all children of slave mothers to follow their condition That is to say the father of the slave may be the President of the Republic but if the mother should be a slave at the infant's birth the poor child is ever legally doomed to the same cruel fate It is a common practice for gentlemen if I may call them such moving in the highest circles of society to be the fathers of children by their slaves whom they can and do sell with the greatest impunity and the more pious beautiful and virtuous the girls are the greater the price they bring and that too for the most infamous purposes Any man with money let him be ever such a rough brute can buy a beautiful and virtuous girl and force her to live with him in a criminal connexion and as the law says a slave shall have no higher appeal than the mere will of the master she cannot escape unless it be by flight or death In endeavouring to reconcile a girl to her fate the master sometimes says that he would marry her if it was not unlawful It is unlawful in the slave States for any one of purely European descent to intermarry with a person of African extraction though a white man may live with as many coloured women as he pleases without materially damaging his reputation in Southern society However he will always consider her to be his wife and will treat her as such and she on the other hand may regard him as her lawful husband and if they have any children they will be free and well educated I am in duty bound to add that while a great majority of such men care nothing for the happiness of the women with whom they live nor for the children of whom they are the fathers there are those to be found even in that heterogeneous mass of licentious monsters who are true to their pledges But as the woman and her children are legally the property of the man who stands in the anomalous relation to them of husband and father as well as master they are liable to be seized and sold for his debts should he become involved There are several cases on record where such persons have been sold and separated for life I know of some myself but I have only space to glance at one I knew a very humane and wealthy gentleman that bought a woman with whom he lived as his wife They brought up a family of children among whom were three nearly white well educated and beautiful girls On the father being suddenly killed it was found that he had not left a will but as the family had always heard him say that he had no surviving relatives they felt that their liberty and property were quite secured to them and knowing the insults to which they were exposed now their protector was no more they were making preparations to leave for a free State But poor creatures they were soon sadly undeceived A villain residing at a distance hearing of the circumstance came forward and swore that he was a relative of the deceased and as this man bore or assumed Mr Slator's name the case was brought before one of those horrible tribunals presided over by a second Judge Jeffreys and calling itself a court of justice but before whom no coloured person nor an abolitionist was ever known to get his full rights A verdict was given in favour of the plaintiff whom the better portion of the community thought had wilfully conspired to cheat the family The heartless wretch not only took the ordinary property but actually had the aged and friendless widow and all her fatherless children except Frank a fine young man about twentytwo years of age and Mary a very nice girl a little younger than her brother brought to the auction stand and sold to the highest bidder Mrs Slator had cash enough that her husband and master left to purchase the liberty of herself and children but on her attempting to do so the pusillanimous scoundrel who had robbed them of their freedom claimed the money as his property and poor creature she had to give it up According to law as will be seen hereafter a slave cannot own anything The old lady never recovered from her sad affliction At the sale she was brought up first and after being vulgarly criticised in the presence of all her distressed family was sold to a cotton planter who he wanted the proud old critter to go to his plantation to look after the little woolly heads while their mammies were working in the field When the sale was over then came the separation and O deep was the anguish of that slave mother's heart When called from her darlings for ever to part The poor mourning mother of reason bereft Soon ended her sorrows and sank cold in death Antoinette the flower of the family a girl who was much beloved by all who knew her for her Christlike piety dignity of manner as well as her great talents and extreme beauty was bought by an uneducated and drunken slavedealer I cannot give a more correct description of the scene when she was called from her brother to the stand than will be found in the following lines Why stands she near the auction stand That girl so young and fair What brings her to this dismal place Why stands she weeping there Why does she raise that bitter cry Why hangs her head with shame As now the auctioneer's rough voice So rudely calls her name But see she grasps a manly hand And in a voice so low As scarcely to be heard she says My brother must I go A moment's pause then midst a wail Of agonizing woe His answer falls upon the ear Yes sister you must go No longer can my arm defend No longer can I save My sister from the horrid fate That waits her as a SLAVE Blush Christian blush for e'en the dark Untutored heathen see Thy inconsistency and lo They scorn thy God and thee The low trade to a kind lady who wished to purchase Antoinette out of his hands I reckon I'll not sell the smart critter for ten thousand dollars I always wanted her for my own use The lady wishing to remonstrate with him commenced by saying You should remember Sir that there is a just God Hoskens not understanding Mrs Huston interrupted her by saying I does and guess its monstrous kind an' him to send such likely niggers for our convenience Mrs Huston finding that a long course of reckless wickedness drunkenness and vice had destroyed in Hoskens every noble impulse left him Antoinette poor girl also seeing that there was no help for her became frantic I can never forget her cries of despair when Hoskens gave the order for her to be taken to his house and locked in an upper room On Hoskens entering the apartment in a state of intoxication a fearful struggle ensued The brave Antoinette broke loose from him pitched herself head foremost through the window and fell upon the pavement below Her bruised but unpolluted body was soon picked uprestoratives broughtdoctor called in but alas it was too late her pure and noble spirit had fled away to be at rest in those realms of endless bliss where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest Antoinette like many other noble women who are deprived of liberty still Holds something sacred something undefiled Some pledge and keepsake of their higher nature And like the diamond in the dark retains Some quenchless gleam of the celestial light On Hoskens fully realizing the fact that his victim was no more he exclaimed By thunder I am a usedup man The sudden disappointment and the loss of two thousand dollars was more than he could endure so he drank more than ever and in a short time died raving mad with delirium tremens The villain Slator to Mrs Huston the kind lady who endeavoured to purchase Antoinette from Hoskins Nobody needn't talk to me 'bout buying them ar likely niggers for I'm not going to sell em But Mary is rather delicate Mrs Huston and being unaccustomed to hard work cannot do you much service on a plantation I don't want her for the field replied Slator but for another purpose Mrs Huston understood what this meant and instantly exclaimed Oh but she is your cousin The devil she is Slator and added Do you mean to insult me Madam by saying that I am related to niggers No replied Mrs Huston I do not wish to offend you Sir But wasn't Mr Slator Mary's father your uncle Yes I calculate he was Slator but I want you and everybody to understand that I'm no kin to his niggers Oh very well Mrs Huston adding Now what will you take for the poor girl Nothin' he replied for as I before I'm not goin' to sell so you needn't trouble yourself no more If the critter behaves herself I'll do as well by her as any man Slator spoke up boldly but his manner and sheepish look clearly indicated that His heart within him was at strife With such accursed gains For he knew whose passions gave her life Whose blood ran in her veins The monster led her from the door He led her by the hand To be his slave and paramour In a strange and distant land Poor Frank and his sister were handcuffed together and confined in prison Their dear little twin brother and sister were sold and taken where they knew not But it often happens that misfortune causes those whom we counted dearest to shrink away while it makes friends of those whom we least expected to take any interest in our affairs Among the latter class Frank found two comparatively new but faithful friends to watch the gloomy paths of the unhappy little twins In a day or two after the sale Slator had two fast horses put to a large light van and placed in it a good many small but valuable things belonging to the distressed family He also took with him Frank and Mary as well as all the money for the spoil and after treating all his low friends and bystanders and drinking deeply himself he started in high glee for his home in South Carolina But they had not proceeded many miles before Frank and his sister discovered that Slator was too drunk to drive But he like most tipsy men thought he was all right and as he had with him some of the ruined family's best brandy and wine such as he had not been accustomed to and being a thirsty soul he drank till the reins fell from his fingers and in attempting to catch them he tumbled out of the vehicle and was unable to get up Frank and Mary there and then contrived a plan by which to escape As they were still handcuffed by one wrist each they alighted took from the drunken assassin's pocket the key undid the iron bracelets and placed them upon Slator who was better fitted to wear such ornaments As the demon lay unconscious of what was taking place Frank and Mary took from him the large sum of money that was realized at the sale as well as that which Slator had so very meanly obtained from their poor mother They then dragged him into the woods tied him to a tree and left the inebriated robber to shift for himself while they made good their escape to Savannah The fugitives being white of course no one suspected that they were slaves Slator was not able to call any one to his rescue till late the next day and as there were no railroads in that part of the country at that time it was not until late the following day that Slator was able to get a party to join him for the chase A person informed Slator that he had met a man and woman in a trap answering to the description of those whom he had lost driving furiously towards Savannah So Slator and several slavehunters on horseback started off in full tilt with their bloodhounds in pursuit of Frank and Mary On arriving at Savannah the hunters found that the fugitives had sold the horses and trap and embarked as free white persons for New York Slator's disappointment and rascality so preyed upon his base mind that he like Judas went and hanged himself As soon as Frank and Mary were safe they endeavoured to redeem their good mother But alas she was gone she had passed on to the realm of spirit life In due time Frank learned from his friends in Georgia where his little brother and sister dwelt So he wrote at once to purchase them but the persons with whom they lived would not sell them After failing in several attempts to buy them Frank cultivated large whiskers and moustachios cut off his hair put on a wig and glasses and went down as a white man and stopped in the neighbourhood where his sister was and after seeing her and also his little brother arrangements were made for them to meet at a particular place on a Sunday which they did and got safely off I saw Frank myself when he came for the little twins Though I was then quite a lad I well remember being highly delighted by hearing him tell how nicely he and Mary had served Slator Frank had so completely disguised or changed his appearance that his little sister did not know him and would not speak till he showed their mother's likeness the sight of which melted her to tearsfor she knew the face Frank might have to her 'O Emma O my sister speak to me Dost thou not know me that I am thy brother Come to me little Emma thou shalt dwell With me henceforth and know no care or want' Emma was silent for a space as if 'Twere hard to summon up a human voice Frank and Mary's mother was my wife's own dear aunt After this great diversion from our narrative which I hope dear reader you will excuse I shall return at once to it My wife was torn from her mother's embrace in childhood and taken to a distant part of the country She had seen so many other children separated from their parents in this cruel manner that the mere thought of her ever becoming the mother of a child to linger out a miserable existence under the wretched system of American slavery appeared to fill her very soul with horror and as she had taken what I felt to be an important view of her condition I did not at first press the marriage but agreed to assist her in trying to devise some plan by which we might escape from our unhappy condition and then be married We thought of plan after plan but they all seemed crowded with insurmountable difficulties We knew it was unlawful for any public conveyance to take us as passengers without our master's consent We were also perfectly aware of the startling fact that had we left without this consent the professional slavehunters would have soon had their ferocious bloodhounds baying on our track and in a short time we should have been dragged back to slavery not to fill the more favourable situations which we had just left but to be separated for life and put to the very meanest and most laborious drudgery or else have been tortured to death as examples in order to strike terror into the hearts of others and thereby prevent them from even attempting to escape from their cruel taskmasters It is a fact worthy of remark that nothing seems to give the slaveholders so much pleasure as the catching and torturing of fugitives They had much rather take the keen and poisonous lash and with it cut their poor trembling victims to atoms than allow one of them to escape to a free country and expose the infamous system from which he fled The greatest excitement prevails at a slavehunt The slaveholders and their hired ruffians appear to take more pleasure in this inhuman pursuit than English sportsmen do in chasing a fox or a stag Therefore knowing what we should have been compelled to suffer if caught and taken back we were more than anxious to hit upon a plan that would lead us safely to a land of liberty But after puzzling our brains for years we were reluctantly driven to the sad conclusion that it was almost impossible to escape from slavery in Georgia and travel miles across the slave States We therefore resolved to get the consent of our owners be married settle down in slavery and endeavour to make ourselves as comfortable as possible under that system but at the same time ever to keep our dim eyes steadily fixed upon the glimmering hope of liberty and earnestly pray God mercifully to assist us to escape from our unjust thraldom We were married and prayed and toiled on till December at which time as I have stated a plan suggested itself that proved quite sucessful and in eight days after it was first thought of we were free from the horrible trammels of slavery and glorifying God who had brought us safely out of a land of bondage Knowing that slaveholders have the privilege of taking their slaves to any part of the country they think proper it occurred to me that as my wife was nearly white I might get her to disguise herself as an invalid gentleman and assume to be my master while I could attend as his slave and that in this manner we might effect our escape After I thought of the plan I suggested it to my wife but at first she shrank from the idea She thought it was almost impossible for her to assume that disguise and travel a distance of miles across the slave States However on the other hand she also thought of her condition She saw that the laws under which we lived did not recognize her to be a woman but a mere chattel to be bought and sold or otherwise dealt with as her owner might see fit Therefore the more she contemplated her helpless condition the more anxious she was to escape from it So she I think it is almost too much for us to undertake however I feel that God is on our side and with his assistance notwithstanding all the difficulties we shall be able to succeed Therefore if you will purchase the disguise I will try to carry out the plan But after I concluded to purchase the disguise I was afraid to go to any one to ask him to sell me the articles It is unlawful in Georgia for a white man to trade with slaves without the master's consent But notwithstanding this many persons will sell a slave any article that he can get the money to buy Not that they sympathize with the slave but merely because his testimony is not admitted in court against a free white person Therefore with little difficulty I went to different parts of the town at odd times and purchased things piece by piece except the trowsers which she found necessary to make and took them home to the house where my wife resided She being a ladies' maid and a favourite slave in the family was allowed a little room to herself and amongst other pieces of furniture which I had made in my overtime was a chest of drawers so when I took the articles home she locked them up carefully in these drawers No one about the premises knew that she had anything of the kind So when we fancied we had everything ready the time was fixed for the flight But we knew it would not do to start off without first getting our master's consent to be away for a few days Had we left without this they would soon have had us back into slavery and probably we should never have got another fair opportunity of even attempting to escape Some of the best slaveholders will sometimes give their favourite slaves a few days' holiday at Christmas time so after no little amount of perseverance on my wife's part she obtained a pass from her mistress allowing her to be away for a few days The cabinetmaker with whom I worked gave me a similar paper but that he needed my services very much and wished me to return as soon as the time granted was up I thanked him kindly but somehow I have not been able to make it convenient to return yet and as the free air of good old England agrees so well with my wife and our dear little ones as well as with myself it is not at all likely we shall return at present to the peculiar institution of chains and stripes On reaching my wife's cottage she handed me her pass and I showed mine but at that time neither of us were able to read them It is not only unlawful for slaves to be taught to read but in some of the States there are heavy penalties attached such as fines and imprisonment which will be vigorously enforced upon any one who is humane enough to violate the socalled law The following case will serve to show how persons are treated in the most enlightened slaveholding community INDICTMENT COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA NORFOLK COUNTY ss In the Circuit Court The Grand Jurors empannelled and sworn to inquire of offences committed in the body of the County on their oath present that Margaret Douglass being an evil disposed person not having the fear of God before her eyes but moved and instigated by the devil wickedly maliciously and feloniously on the fourth day of July in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fiftyfour at Norfolk in County did teach a certain black girl named Kate to read in the Bible to the great displeasure of Almighty God to the pernicious example of others in like case offending contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided and against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of Virginia VICTOR VAGABOND Prosecuting Attorney On this indictment Mrs Douglass was arraigned as a necessary matter of form tried found guilty of course and Judge Scalawag before whom she was tried having consulted with Dr Adams ordered the sheriff to place Mrs Douglass in the prisoner's box when he addressed her as follows 'Margaret Douglass stand up You are guilty of one of the vilest crimes that ever disgraced society and the jury have found you so You have taught a slave girl to read in the Bible No enlightened society can exist where such offences go unpunished The Court in your case do not feel for you one solitary ray of sympathy and they will inflict on you the utmost penalty of the law In any other civilized country you would have paid the forfeit of your crime with your life and the Court have only to regret that such is not the law in this country The sentence for your offence is that you be imprisoned one month in the county jail and that you pay the costs of this prosecution Sheriff remove the prisoner to jail' On the publication of these proceedings the Doctors of Divinity preached each a sermon on the necessity of obeying the laws the New York Observer noticed with much pious gladness a revival of religion on Dr Smith's plantation in Georgia among his slaves while the Journal of Commerce commended this political preaching of the Doctors of Divinity because it favoured slavery Let us do nothing to offend our Southern brethren However at first we were highly delighted at the idea of having gained permission to be absent for a few days but when the thought flashed across my wife's mind that it was customary for travellers to register their names in the visitors' book at hotels as well as in the clearance or Customhouse book at Charleston South Carolinait made our spirits droop within us So while sitting in our little room upon the verge of despair all at once my wife raised her head and with a smile upon her face which was a moment before bathed in tears I think I have it I asked what it was She I think I can make a poultice and bind up my right hand in a sling and with propriety ask the officers to register my name for me I thought that would do It then occurred to her that the smoothness of her face might betray her so she decided to make another poultice and put it in a white handkerchief to be worn under the chin up the cheeks and to tie over the head This nearly hid the expression of the countenance as well as the beardless chin The poultice is left off in the engraving because the likeness could not have been taken well with it on My wife knowing that she would be thrown a good deal into the company of gentlemen fancied that she could get on better if she had something to go over the eyes so I went to a shop and bought a pair of green spectacles This was in the evening We sat up all night discussing the plan and making preparations Just before the time arrived in the morning for us to leave I cut off my wife's hair square at the back of the head and got her to dress in the disguise and stand out on the floor I found that she made a most respectable looking gentleman My wife had no ambition whatever to assume this disguise and would not have done so had it been possible to have obtained our liberty by more simple means but we knew it was not customary in the South for ladies to travel with male servants and therefore notwithstanding my wife's fair complexion it would have been a very difficult task for her to have come off as a free white lady with me as her slave in fact her not being able to write would have made this quite impossible We knew that no public conveyance would take us or any other slave as a passenger without our master's consent This consent could never be obtained to pass into a free State My wife's being muffled in the poultices c furnished a plausible excuse for avoiding general conversation of which most Yankee travellers are passionately fond There are a large number of free negroes residing in the southern States but in Georgia and I believe in all the slave States every coloured person's complexion is prim facie evidence of his being a slave and the lowest villain in the country should he be a white man has the legal power to arrest and question in the most inquisitorial and insulting manner any coloured person male or female that he may find at large particularly at night and on Sundays without a written pass signed by the master or some one in authority or stamped free papers certifying that the person is the rightful owner of himself If the coloured person refuses to answer questions put to him he may be beaten and his defending himself against this attack makes him an outlaw and if he be killed on the spot the murderer will be exempted from all blame but after the coloured person has answered the questions put to him in a most humble and pointed manner he may then be taken to prison and should it turn out after further examination that he was caught where he had no permission or legal right to be and that he has not given what they term a satisfactory account of himself the master will have to pay a fine On his refusing to do this the poor slave may be legally and severely flogged by public officers Should the prisoner prove to be a free man he is most likely to be both whipped and fined The great majority of slaveholders hate this class of persons with a hatred that can only be equalled by the condemned spirits of the infernal regions They have no mercy upon nor sympathy for any negro whom they cannot enslave They say that God made the black man to be a slave for the white and act as though they really believed that all free persons of colour are in open rebellion to a direct command from heaven and that they the whites are God's chosen agents to pour out upon them unlimited vengeance For instance a Bill has been introduced in the Tennessee Legislature to prevent free negroes from travelling on the railroads in that State It has passed the first reading The bill provides that the President who shall permit a free negro to travel on any road within the jurisdiction of the State under his supervision shall pay a fine of dollars any conductor permitting a violation of the Act shall pay dollars provided such free negro is not under the control of a free white citizen of Tennessee who will vouch for the character of free negro in a penal bond of one thousand dollars The State of Arkansas has passed a law to banish all free negroes from its bounds and it came into effect on the st day of January Every free negro found there after that date will be liable to be sold into slavery the crime of freedom being unpardonable The Missouri Senate has before it a bill providing that all free negroes above the age of eighteen years who shall be found in the State after September shall be sold into slavery and that all such negroes as shall enter the State after September and remain there twentyfour hours shall also be sold into slavery for ever Mississippi Kentucky and Georgia and in fact I believe all the slave States are legislating in the same manner Thus the slaveholders make it almost impossible for free persons of colour to get out of the slave States in order that they may sell them into slavery if they don't go If no white persons travelled upon railroads except those who could get some one to vouch for their character in a penal bond of one thousand dollars the railroad companies would soon go to the wall Such mean legislation is too low for comment therefore I leave the villanous acts to speak for themselves But the Dred Scott decision is the crowning act of infamous Yankee legislation The Supreme Court the highest tribunal of the Republic composed of nine Judge Jeffries's chosen both from the free and slave States has decided that no coloured person or persons of African extraction can ever become a citizen of the United States or have any rights which white men are bound to respect That is to say in the opinion of this Court robbery rape and murder are not crimes when committed by a white upon a coloured person Judges who will sneak from their high and honourable position down into the lowest depths of human depravity and scrape up a decision like this are wholly unworthy the confidence of any people I believe such men would if they had the power and were it to their temporal interest sell their country's independence and barter away every man's birthright for a mess of pottage Well may Thomas Campbell say United States your banner wears Two emblemsone of fame Alas the other that it bears Reminds us of your shame The white man's liberty in types Stands blazoned by your stars But what's the meaning of your stripes They mean your Negroscars When the time had arrived for us to start we blew out the lights knelt down and prayed to our Heavenly Father mercifully to assist us as he did his people of old to escape from cruel bondage and we shall ever feel that God heard and answered our prayer Had we not been sustained by a kind and I sometimes think special providence we could never have overcome the mountainous difficulties which I am now about to describe After this we rose and stood for a few moments in breathless silencewe were afraid that some one might have been about the cottage listening and watching our movements So I took my wife by the hand stepped softly to the door raised the latch drew it open and peeped out Though there were trees all around the house yet the foliage scarcely moved in fact everything appeared to be as still as death I then whispered to my wife Come my dear let us make a desperate leap for liberty But poor thing she shrank back in a state of trepidation I turned and asked what was the matter she made no reply but burst into violent sobs and threw her head upon my breast This appeared to touch my very heart it caused me to enter into her feelings more fully than ever We both saw the many mountainous difficulties that rose one after the other before our view and knew far too well what our sad fate would have been were we caught and forced back into our slavish den Therefore on my wife's fully realizing the solemn fact that we had to take our lives as it were in our hands and contest every inch of the thousand miles of slave territory over which we had to pass it made her heart almost sink within her and had I known them at that time I would have repeated the following encouraging lines which may not be out of place here The hill though high I covet to ascend The difficulty will not me offend For I perceive the way to life lies here Come pluck up heart let's neither faint nor fear Better though difficult the right way to go Than wrong though easy where the end is woe However the sobbing was soon over and after a few moments of silent prayer she recovered her selfpossession and Come William it is getting late so now let us venture upon our perilous journey We then opened the door and stepped as softly out as moonlight upon the water I locked the door with my own key which I now have before me and tiptoed across the yard into the street I say tiptoed because we were like persons near a tottering avalanche afraid to move or even breathe freely for fear the sleeping tyrants should be aroused and come down upon us with double vengeance for daring to attempt to escape in the manner which we contemplated We shook hands farewell and started in different directions for the railway station I took the nearest possible way to the train for fear I should be recognized by some one and got into the negro car in which I knew I should have to ride but my master as I will now call my wife took a longer way round and only arrived there with the bulk of the passengers He obtained a ticket for himself and one for his slave to Savannah the first port which was about two hundred miles off My master then had the luggage stowed away and stepped into one of the best carriages But just before the train moved off I peeped through the window and to my great astonishment I saw the cabinetmaker with whom I had worked so long on the platform He stepped up to the ticketseller and asked some question and then commenced looking rapidly through the passengers and into the carriages Fully believing that we were caught I shrank into a corner turned my face from the door and expected in a moment to be dragged out The cabinetmaker looked into my master's carriage but did not know him in his new attire and as God would have it before he reached mine the bell rang and the train moved off I have heard since that the cabinetmaker had a presentiment that we were about to make tracks for parts unknown but not seeing me his suspicions vanished until he received the startling intelligence that we had arrived safely in a free State As soon as the train had left the platform my master looked round in the carriage and was terrorstricken to find a Mr Crayan old friend of my wife's master who dined with the family the day before and knew my wife from childhoodsitting on the same seat The doors of the American railway carriages are at the ends The passengers walk up the aisle and take seats on either side and as my master was engaged in looking out of the window he did not see who came in My master's first impression after seeing Mr Cray was that he was there for the purpose of securing him However my master thought it was not wise to give any information respecting himself and for fear that Mr Cray might draw him into conversation and recognise his voice my master resolved to feign deafness as the only means of selfdefence After a little while Mr Cray to my master It is a very fine morning sir The latter took no notice but kept looking out of the window Mr Cray soon repeated this remark in a little louder tone but my master remained as before This indifference attracted the attention of the passengers near one of whom laughed out This I suppose annoyed the old gentleman so he I will make him hear and in a loud tone of voice repeated It is a very fine morning sir My master turned his head and with a polite bow Yes and commenced looking out of the window again One of the gentlemen remarked that it was a very great deprivation to be deaf Yes replied Mr Cray and I shall not trouble that fellow any more This enabled my master to breathe a little easier and to feel that Mr Cray was not his pursuer after all The gentlemen then turned the conversation upon the three great topics of discussion in firstclass circles in Georgia namely Niggers Cotton and the Abolitionists My master had often heard of abolitionists but in such a connection as to cause him to think that they were a fearful kind of wild animal But he was highly delighted to learn from the gentlemen's conversation that the abolitionists were persons who were opposed to oppression and therefore in his opinion not the lowest but the very highest of God's creatures Without the slightest objection on my master's part the gentlemen left the carriage at Gordon for Milledgeville the capital of the State We arrived at Savannah early in the evening and got into an omnibus which stopped at the hotel for the passengers to take tea I stepped into the house and brought my master something on a tray to the omnibus which took us in due time to the steamer which was bound for Charleston South Carolina Soon after going on board my master turned in and as the captain and some of the passengers seemed to think this strange and also questioned me respecting him my master thought I had better get out the flannels and opodeldoc which we had prepared for the rheumatism warm them quickly by the stove in the gentleman's saloon and bring them to his berth We did this as an excuse for my master's retiring to bed so early While at the stove one of the passengers to me Buck what have you got there Opodeldoc sir I replied I should think it's opodevil a lanky swell who was leaning back in a chair with his heels upon the back of another and chewing tobacco as if for a wager it stinks enough to kill or cure twenty men Away with it or I reckon I will throw it overboard It was by this time warm enough so I took it to my master's berth remained there a little while and then went on deck and asked the steward where I was to sleep He there was no place provided for coloured passengers whether slave or free So I paced the deck till a late hour then mounted some cotton bags in a warm place near the funnel sat there till morning and then went and assisted my master to get ready for breakfast He was seated at the right hand of the captain who together with all the passengers inquired very kindly after his health As my master had one hand in a sling it was my duty to carve his food But when I went out the captain You have a very attentive boy sir but you had better watch him like a hawk when you get on to the North He seems all very well here but he may act quite differently there I know several gentlemen who have lost their valuable niggers among them dd cutthroat abolitionists Before my master could speak a rough slavedealer who was sitting opposite with both elbows on the table and with a large piece of broiled fowl in his fingers shook his head with emphasis and in a deep Yankee tone forced through his crowded mouth the words Sound doctrine captain very sound He then dropped the chicken into the plate leant back placed his thumbs in the armholes of his fancy waistcoat and continued I would not take a nigger to the North under no consideration I have had a deal to do with niggers in my time but I never saw one who ever had his heel upon free soil that was worth a dn Now stranger addressing my master if you have made up your mind to sell that ere nigger I am your man just mention your price and if it isn't out of the way I will pay for him on this board with hard silver dollars This hardfeatured bristlybearded wireheaded redeyed monster staring at my master as the serpent did at Eve What do you say stranger He replied I don't wish to sell sir I cannot get on well without him You will have to get on without him if you take him to the North continued this man for I can tell ye stranger as a friend I am an older cove than you I have seen lots of this ere world and I reckon I have had more dealings with niggers than any man living or dead I was once employed by General Wade Hampton for ten years in doing nothing but breaking 'em in and everybody knows that the General would not have a man that didn't understand his business So I tell ye stranger again you had better sell and let me take him down to Orleans he will do you no good if you take him across Mason's and Dixon's line he is a keen nigger and I can see from the cut of his eye that he is certain to run away My master I think not sir I have great confidence in his fidelity Fidevil indignantly the dealer as his fist came down upon the edge of the saucer and upset a cup of hot coffee in a gentleman's lap As the scalded man jumped up the trader quietly Don't disturb yourself neighbour accidents will happen in the best of families It always makes me mad to hear a man talking about fidelity in niggers There isn't a dd one on 'em who wouldn't cut sticks if he had half a chance By this time we were near Charleston my master thanked the captain for his advice and they all withdrew and went on deck where the trader fancied he became quite eloquent He drew a crowd around him and with emphasis Cap'en if I was the President of this mighty United States of America the greatest and freest country under the whole univarse I would never let no man I don't care who he is take a nigger into the North and bring him back here filled to the brim as he is sure to be with dd abolition vices to taint all quiet niggers with the hellish spirit of running away These air cap'en my flatfooted every day right up and down sentiments and as this is a free country cap'en I don't care who hears 'em for I am a Southern man every inch on me to the backbone Good an insignificantlooking individual of the slavedealer stamp Three cheers for John C Calhoun and the whole fair sunny South added the trader So off went their hats and out burst a terrific roar of irregular but continued cheering My master took no more notice of the dealer He merely to the captain that the air on deck was too keen for him and he would therefore return to the cabin While the trader was in the zenith of his eloquence he might as well have as one of his kit did at a great Filibustering meeting that When the great American Eagle gets one of his mighty claws upon Canada and the other into South America and his glorious and starry wings of liberty extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific oh then where will England be ye gentlemen I tell ye she will only serve as a pockethandkerchief for Jonathan to wipe his nose with On my master entering the cabin he found at the breakfasttable a young southern military officer with whom he had travelled some distance the previous day After passing the usual compliments the conversation turned upon the old subjectniggers The officer who was also travelling with a manservant to my master You will excuse me Sir for saying I think you are very likely to spoil your boy by saying 'thank you' to him I assure you sir nothing spoils a slave so soon as saying 'thank you' and 'if you please' to him The only way to make a nigger toe the mark and to keep him in his place is to storm at him like thunder and keep him trembling like a leaf Don't you see when I speak to my Nod he darts like lightning and if he didn't I'd skin him Just then the poor dejected slave came in and the officer swore at him fearfully merely to teach my master what he called the proper way to treat me After he had gone out to get his master's luggage ready the officer That is the way to speak to them If every nigger was drilled in this manner they would be as humble as dogs and never dare to run away The gentleman urged my master not to go to the North for the restoration of his health but to visit the Warm Springs in Arkansas My master he thought the air of Philadelphia would suit his complaint best and not only so he thought he could get better advice there The boat had now reached the wharf The officer wished my master a safe and pleasant journey and left the saloon There were a large number of persons on the quay waiting the arrival of the steamer but we were afraid to venture out for fear that some one might recognize me or that they had heard that we were gone and had telegraphed to have us stopped However after remaining in the cabin till all the other passengers were gone we had our luggage placed on a fly and I took my master by the arm and with a little difficulty he hobbled on shore got in and drove off to the best hotel which John C Calhoun and all the other great southern fireeating statesmen made their headquarters while in Charleston On arriving at the house the landlord ran out and opened the door but judging from the poultices and green glasses that my master was an invalid he took him very tenderly by one arm and ordered his man to take the other My master then eased himself out and with their assistance found no trouble in getting up the steps into the hotel The proprietor made me stand on one side while he paid my master the attention and homage he thought a gentleman of his high position merited My master asked for a bedroom The servant was ordered to show a good one into which we helped him The servant returned My master then handed me the bandages I took them downstairs in great haste and told the landlord my master wanted two hot poultices as quickly as possible He rang the bell the servant came in to whom he Run to the kitchen and tell the cook to make two hot poultices right off for there is a gentleman upstairs very badly off indeed In a few minutes the smoking poultices were brought in I placed them in white handkerchiefs and hurried upstairs went into my master's apartment shut the door and laid them on the mantelpiece As he was alone for a little while he thought he could rest a great deal better with the poultices off However it was necessary to have them to complete the remainder of the journey I then ordered dinner and took my master's boots out to polish them While doing so I entered into conversation with one of the slaves I may state here that on the seacoast of South Carolina and Georgia the slaves speak worse English than in any other part of the country This is owing to the frequent importation or smuggling in of Africans who mingle with the natives Consequently the language cannot properly be called English or African but a corruption of the two The shrewd son of African parents to whom I referred to me Say brudder way you come from and which side you goin day wid dat ar little don up buckra white man I replied To Philadelphia What he exclaimed with astonishment to Philumadelphy Yes I By squash I wish I was going wid you I hears um say dat dare's no slaves way over in dem parts is um so I quietly I have heard the same thing Well continued he as he threw down the boot and brush and placing his hands in his pockets strutted across the floor with an air of independenceGorra Mighty dem is de parts for Pompey and I hope when you get dare you will stay and nebber follow dat buckra back to dis hot quarter no more let him be eber so good I thanked him and just as I took the boots up and started off he caught my hand between his two and gave it a hearty shake and with tears streaming down his cheeks God bless you broder and may de Lord be wid you When you gets de freedom and sitin under your own wine and figtree don't forget to pray for poor Pompey I was afraid to say much to him but I shall never forget his earnest request nor fail to do what little I can to release the millions of unhappy bondmen of whom he was one At the proper time my master had the poultices placed on came down and seated himself at a table in a very brilliant diningroom to have his dinner I had to have something at the same time in order to be ready for the boat so they gave me my dinner in an old broken plate with a rusty knife and fork and Here boy you go in the kitchen I took it and went out but did not stay more than a few minutes because I was in a great hurry to get back to see how the invalid was getting on On arriving I found two or three servants waiting on him but as he did not feel able to make a very hearty dinner he soon finished paid the bill and gave the servants each a trifle which caused one of them to say to me Your massa is a big bugmeaning a gentleman of distinctionhe is the greatest gentleman dat has been dis way for dis six months I Yes he is some pumpkins meaning the same as big bug When we left Maon it was our intention to take a steamer at Charleston through to Philadelphia but on arriving there we found that the vessels did not run during the winter and I have no doubt it was well for us they did not for on the very last voyage the steamer made that we intended to go by a fugitive was discovered secreted on board and sent back to slavery However as we had also heard of the Overland Mail Route we were all right So I ordered a fly to the door had the luggage placed on we got in and drove down to the Customhouse Office which was near the wharf where we had to obtain tickets to take a steamer for Wilmington North Carolina When we reached the building I helped my master into the office which was crowded with passengers He asked for a ticket for himself and one for his slave to Philadelphia This caused the principal officera very meanlooking cheesecoloured fellow who was sitting thereto look up at us very suspiciously and in a fierce tone of voice he to me Boy do you belong to that gentleman I quickly replied Yes sir which was quite correct The tickets were handed out and as my master was paying for them the chief man to him I wish you to register your name here sir and also the name of your nigger and pay a dollar duty on him My master paid the dollar and pointing to the hand that was in the poultice requested the officer to register his name for him This seemed to offend the highbred South Carolinian He jumped up shaking his head and cramming his hands almost through the bottom of his trousers pockets with a slavebullying air I shan't do it This attracted the attention of all the passengers Just then the young military officer with whom my master travelled and conversed on the steamer from Savannah stepped in somewhat the worse for brandy he shook hands with my master and pretended to know all about him He I know his kin friends like a book and as the officer was known in Charleston and was going to stop there with friends the recognition was very much in my master's favour The captain of the steamer a goodlooking jovial fellow seeing that the gentleman appeared to know my master and perhaps not wishing to lose us as passengers in an offhand sailorlike manner I will register the gentleman's name and take the responsibility upon myself He asked my master's name He William Johnson The names were put down I think Mr Johnson and slave The captain It's all right now Mr Johnson He thanked him kindly and the young officer begged my master to go with him and have something to drink and a cigar but as he had not acquired these accomplishments he excused himself and we went on board and came off to Wilmington North Carolina When the gentleman finds out his mistake he will I have no doubt be careful in future not to pretend to have an intimate acquaintance with an entire stranger During the voyage the captain It was rather sharp shooting this morning Mr Johnson It was not out of any disrespect to you sir but they make it a rule to be very strict at Charleston I have known families to be detained there with their slaves till reliable information could be received respecting them If they were not very careful and dd abolitionist might take off a lot of valuable niggers My master I suppose so and thanked him again for helping him over the difficulty We reached Wilmington the next morning and took the train for Richmond Virginia I have stated that the American railway carriages or cars as they are called are constructed differently to those in England At one end of some of them in the South there is a little apartment with a couch on both sides for the convenience of families and invalids and as they thought my master was very poorly he was allowed to enter one of these apartments at Petersburg Virginia where an old gentleman and two handsome young ladies his daughters also got in and took seats in the same carriage But before the train started the gentleman stepped into my car and questioned me respecting my master He wished to know what was the matter with him where he was from and where he was going I told him where he came from and that he was suffering from a complication of complaints and was going to Philadelphia where he thought he could get more suitable advice than in Georgia The gentleman my master could obtain the very best advice in Philadelphia Which turned out to be quite correct though he did not receive it from physicians but from kind abolitionists who understood his case much better The gentleman also I reckon your master's father hasn't any more such faithful and smart boys as you O yes sir he has I replied lots on 'em Which was literally true This seemed all he wished to know He thanked me gave me a tencent piece and requested me to be attentive to my good master I promised that I would do so and have ever since endeavoured to keep my pledge During the gentleman's absence the ladies and my master had a little cosy chat But on his return he You seem to be very much afflicted sir Yes sir replied the gentleman in the poultices What seems to be the matter with you sir may I be allowed to ask Inflammatory rheumatism sir Oh that is very bad sir the kind gentleman I can sympathise with you for I know from bitter experience what the rheumatism is If he did he knew a good deal more than Mr Johnson The gentleman thought my master would feel better if he would lie down and rest himself and as he was anxious to avoid conversation he at once acted upon this suggestion The ladies politely rose took their extra shawls and made a nice pillow for the invalid's head My master wore a fashionable cloth cloak which they took and covered him comfortably on the couch After he had been lying a little while the ladies I suppose thought he was asleep so one of them gave a long sigh and in a quiet fascinating tone Papa he seems to be a very nice young gentleman But before papa could speak the other lady quickly Oh dear me I never felt so much for a gentleman in my life To use an American expression they fell in love with the wrong chap After my master had been lying a little while he got up the gentleman assisted him in getting on his cloak the ladies took their shawls and soon all were seated They then insisted upon Mr Johnson taking some of their refreshments which of course he did out of courtesy to the ladies All went on enjoying themselves until they reached Richmond where the ladies and their father left the train But before doing so the good old Virginian gentleman who appeared to be much pleased with my master presented him with a recipe which he was a perfect cure for the inflammatory rheumatism But the invalid not being able to read it and fearing he should hold it upside down in pretending to do so thanked the donor kindly and placed it in his waistcoat pocket My master's new friend also gave him his card and requested him the next time he travelled that way to do him the kindness to call adding I shall be pleased to see you and so will my daughters Mr Johnson expressed his gratitude for the proffered hospitality and he should feel glad to call on his return I have not the slightest doubt that he will fulfil the promise whenever that return takes place After changing trains we went on a little beyond Fredericksburg and took a steamer to Washington At Richmond a stout elderly lady whose whole demeanour indicated that she belonged as Mrs Stowe's Aunt Chloe expresses it to one of the firstest families stepped into the carriage and took a seat near my master Seeing me passing quickly along the platform she sprang up as if taken by a fit and exclaimed Bless my soul there goes my nigger Ned My master No that is my boy The lady paid no attention to this she poked her head out of the window and bawled to me You Ned come to me sir you runaway rascal On my looking round she drew her head in and to my master I beg your pardon sir I was sure it was my nigger I never in my life saw two black pigs more alike than your boy and my Ned After the disappointed lady had resumed her seat and the train had moved off she closed her eyes slightly raising her hands and in a sanctified tone to my master Oh I hope sir your boy will not turn out to be so worthless as my Ned has Oh I was as kind to him as if he had been my own son Oh sir it grieves me very much to think that after all I did for him he should go off without having any cause whatever When did he leave you asked Mr Johnson About eighteen months ago and I have never seen hair or hide of him since Did he have a wife enquired a very respectablelooking young gentleman who was sitting near my master and opposite to the lady No sir not when he left though he did have one a little before that She was very unlike him she was as good and as faithful a nigger as any one need wish to have But poor thing she became so ill that she was unable to do much work so I thought it would be best to sell her to go to New Orleans where the climate is nice and warm I suppose she was very glad to go South for the restoration of her health the gentleman No she was not replied the lady for niggers never know what is best for them She took on a great deal about leaving Ned and the little nigger but as she was so weakly I let her go Was she goodlooking asked the young passenger who was evidently not of the same opinion as the talkative lady and therefore wished her to tell all she knew Yes she was very handsome and much whiter than I am and therefore will have no trouble in getting another husband I am sure I wish her well I asked the speculator who bought her to sell her to a good master Poor thing she has my prayers and I know she prays for me She was a good Christian and always used to pray for my soul It was through her earliest prayers continued the lady that I was first led to seek forgiveness of my sins before I was converted at the great campmeeting This caused the lady to snuffle and to draw from her pocket a richly embroidered handkerchief and apply it to the corner of her eyes But my mast could not see that it was at all soiled The silence which prevailed for a few moments was broken by the gentleman's saying As your 'July' was such a very good girl and had served you so faithfully before she lost her health don't you think it would have been better to have emancipated her No indeed I do not scornfully exclaimed the lady as she impatiently crammed the fine handkerchief into a little workbag I have no patience with people who set niggers at liberty It is the very worst thing you can do for them My dear husband just before he died willed all his niggers free But I and all our friends knew very well that he was too good a man to have ever thought of doing such an unkind and foolish thing had he been in his right mind and therefore we had the will altered as it should have been in the first place Did you mean madam asked my master that willing the slaves free was unjust to yourself or unkind to them I mean that it was decidedly unkind to the servants themselves It always seems to me such a cruel thing to turn niggers loose to shift for themselves when there are so many good masters to take care of them As for myself continued the considerate lady I thank the Lord my dear husband left me and my son well provided for Therefore I care nothing for the niggers on my own account for they are a great deal more trouble than they are worth I sometimes wish that there was not one of them in the world for the ungrateful wretches are always running away I have lost no less than ten since my poor husband died It's ruinous sir But as you are well provided for I suppose you do not feel the loss very much the passenger I don't feel it at all haughtily continued the good soul but that is no reason why property should be squandered If my son and myself had the money for those valuable niggers just see what a great deal of good we could do for the poor and in sending missionaries abroad to the poor heathen who have never heard the name of our blessed Redeemer My dear son who is a good Christian minister has advised me not to worry and send my soul to hell for the sake of niggers but to sell every blessed one of them for what they will fetch and go and live in peace with him in New York This I have concluded to do I have just been to Richmond and made arrangements with my agent to make clean work of the forty that are left Your son being a good Christian minister the gentleman It's strange he did not advise you to let the poor negroes have their liberty and go North It's not at all strange sir it's not at all strange My son knows what's best for the niggers he has always told me that they were much better off than the free niggers in the North In fact I don't believe there are any white labouring people in the world who are as well off as the slaves You are quite mistaken madam the young man For instance my own widowed mother before she died emancipated all her slaves and sent them to Ohio where they are getting along well I saw several of them last summer myself Well replied the lady freedom may do for your ma's niggers but it will never do for mine and plague them they shall never have it that is the word with the bark on it If freedom will not do for your slaves replied the passenger I have no doubt your Ned and the other nine negroes will find out their mistake and return to their old home Blast them exclaimed the old lady with great emphasis if I ever get them I will cook their infernal hash and tan their accursed black hides well for them God forgive me added the old soul the niggers will make me lose all my religion By this time the lady had reached her destination The gentleman got out at the next station beyond As soon as she was gone the young Southerner to my master What a dd shame it is for that old whining hypocritical humbug to cheat the poor negroes out of their liberty If she has religion may the devil prevent me from ever being converted For the purpose of somewhat disguising myself I bought and wore a very good secondhand white beaver an article which I had never indulged in before So just before we arrived at Washington an uncouth planter who had been watching me very closely to my master I reckon stranger you are 'spiling' that ere nigger of yourn by letting him wear such a devilish fine hat Just look at the quality on it the President couldn't wear a better I should just like to go and kick it overboard His friend touched him and Don't speak so to a gentleman Why not exclaimed the fellow He grated his short teeth which appeared to be nearly worn away by the incessant chewing of tobacco and It always makes me itch all over from head to toe to get hold of every dd nigger I see dressed like a white man Washington is run away with spiled and free niggers If I had my way I would sell every dd rascal of 'em way down South where the devil would be whipped out on 'em This man's fierce manner made my master feel rather nervous and therefore he thought the less he the better so he walked off without making any reply In a few minutes we were landed at Washington where we took a conveyance and hurried off to the train for Baltimore We left our cottage on Wednesday morning the st of December and arrived at Baltimore Saturday evening the th Christmas Eve Baltimore was the last slave port of any note at which we stopped On arriving there we felt more anxious than ever because we knew not what that last dark night would bring forth It is true we were near the goal but our poor hearts were still as if tossed at sea and as there was another great and dangerous bar to pass we were afraid our liberties would be wrecked and like the illfated Royal Charter go down for ever just off the place we longed to reach They are particularly watchful at Baltimore to prevent slaves from escaping into Pennsylvania which is a free State After I had seen my master into one of the best carriages and was just about to step into mine an officer a fullblooded Yankee of the lower order saw me He came quickly up and tapping me on the shoulder in his unmistakable native twang together with no little display of his authority Where are you going boy To Philadelphia sir I humbly replied Well what are you going there for I am travelling with my master who is in the next carriage sir Well I calculate you had better get him out and be mighty quick about it because the train will soon be starting It is against my rules to let any man take a slave past here unless he can satisfy them in the office that he has a right to take him along The officer then passed on and left me standing upon the platform with my anxious heart apparently palpitating in the throat At first I scarcely knew which way to turn But it soon occurred to me that the good God who had been with us thus far would not forsake us at the eleventh hour So with renewed hope I stepped into my master's carriage to inform him of the difficulty I found him sitting at the farther end quite alone As soon as he looked up and saw me he smiled I also tried to wear a cheerful countenance in order to break the shock of the sad news I knew what made him smile He was aware that if we were fortunate we should reach our destination at five o'clock the next morning and this made it the more painful to communicate what the officer had but as there was no time to lose I went up to him and asked him how he felt He Much better and that he thanked God we were getting on so nicely I then we were not getting on quite so well as we had anticipated He anxiously and quickly asked what was the matter I told him He started as if struck by lightning and exclaimed Good Heavens William is it possible that we are after all doomed to hopeless bondage I could say nothing my heart was too full to speak for at first I did not know what to do However we knew it would never do to turn back to the City of Destruction like Bunyan's Mistrust and Timorous because they saw lions in the narrow way after ascending the hill Difficulty but press on like noble Christian and Hopeful to the great city in which dwelt a few shining ones So after a few moments I did all I could to encourage my companion and we stepped out and made for the office but how or where my master obtained sufficient courage to face the tyrants who had power to blast all we held dear heaven only knows Queen Elizabeth could not have been more terrorstricken on being forced to land at the traitors' gate leading to the Tower than we were on entering that office We felt that our very existence was at stake and that we must either sink or swim But as God was our present and mighty helper in this as well as in all former trials we were able to keep our heads up and press forwards On entering the room we found the principal man to whom my master Do you wish to see me sir Yes this eagleeyed officer and he added It is against our rules sir to allow any person to take a slave out of Baltimore into Philadelphia unless he can satisfy us that he has a right to take him along Why is that asked my master with more firmness than could be expected Because sir continued he in a voice and manner that almost chilled our blood if we should suffer any gentleman to take a slave past here into Philadelphia and should the gentleman with whom the slave might be travelling turn out not to be his rightful owner and should the proper master come and prove that his slave escaped on our road we shall have him to pay for and therefore we cannot let any slave pass here without receiving security to show and to satisfy us that it is all right This conversation attracted the attention of the large number of bustling passengers After the officer had finished a few of them Chit chit chit not because they thought we were slaves endeavouring to escape but merely because they thought my master was a slaveholder and invalid gentleman and therefore it was wrong to detain him The officer observing that the passengers sympathised with my master asked him if he was not acquainted with some gentleman in Baltimore that he could get to endorse for him to show that I was his property and that he had a right to take me off He No and added I bought tickets in Charleston to pass us through to Philadelphia and therefore you have no right to detain us here Well sir the man indignantly right or no right we shan't let you go These sharp words fell upon our anxious hearts like the crack of doom and made us feel that hope only smiles to deceive For a few moments perfect silence prevailed My master looked at me and I at him but neither of us dared to speak a word for fear of making some blunder that would tend to our detection We knew that the officers had power to throw us into prison and if they had done so we must have been detected and driven back like the vilest felons to a life of slavery which we dreaded far more than sudden death We felt as though we had come into deep waters and were about being overwhelmed and that the slightest mistake would clip asunder the last brittle thread of hope by which we were suspended and let us down for ever into the dark and horrible pit of misery and degradation from which we were straining every nerve to escape While our hearts were crying lustily unto Him who is ever ready and able to save the conductor of the train that we had just left stepped in The officer asked if we came by the train with him from Washington he we did and left the room Just then the bell rang for the train to leave and had it been the sudden shock of an earthquake it could not have given us a greater thrill The sound of the bell caused every eye to flash with apparent interest and to be more steadily fixed upon us than before But as God would have it the officer all at once thrust his fingers through his hair and in a state of great agitation I really don't know what to do I calculate it is all right He then told the clerk to run and tell the conductor to let this gentleman and slave pass adding As he is not well it is a pity to stop him here We will let him go My master thanked him and stepped out and hobbled across the platform as quickly as possible I tumbled him unceremoniously into one of the best carriages and leaped into mine just as the train was gliding off towards our happy destination We thought of this plan about four days before we left Maon and as we had our daily employment to attend to we only saw each other at night So we sat up the four long nights talking over the plan and making preparations We had also been four days on the journey and as we travelled night and day we got but very limited opportunities for sleeping I believe nothing in the world could have kept us awake so long but the intense excitement produced by the fear of being retaken on the one hand and the bright anticipation of liberty on the other We left Baltimore about eight o'clock in the evening and not being aware of a stoppingplace of any consequence between there and Philadelphia and also knowing that if we were fortunate we should be in the latter place early the next morning I thought I might indulge in a few minutes' sleep in the car but I like Bunyan's Christian in the arbour went to sleep at the wrong time and took too long a nap So when the train reached Havre de Grace all the firstclass passengers had to get out of the carriages and into a ferryboat to be ferried across the Susquehanna river and take the train on the opposite side The road was constructed so as to be raised or lowered to suit the tide So they rolled the luggagevans on to the boat and off on the other side and as I was in one of the apartments adjoining a baggagecar they considered it unnecessary to awaken me and tumbled me over with the luggage But when my master was asked to leave his seat he found it very dark and cold and raining He missed me for the first time on the journey On all previous occasions as soon as the train stopped I was at hand to assist him This caused many slaveholders to praise me very much they they had never before seen a slave so attentive to his master and therefore my absence filled him with terror and confusion the children of Israel could not have felt more troubled on arriving at the Red Sea So he asked the conductor if he had seen anything of his slave The man being somewhat of an abolitionist and believing that my master was really a slaveholder thought he would tease him a little respecting me So he No sir I haven't seen anything of him for some time I have no doubt he has run away and is in Philadelphia free long before now My master knew that there was nothing in this so he asked the conductor if he would please to see if he could find me The man indignantly replied I am no slavehunter and as far as I am concerned everybody must look after their own niggers He went off and left the confused invalid to fancy whatever he felt inclined My master at first thought I must have been kidnapped into slavery by some one or left or perhaps killed on the train He also thought of stopping to see if he could hear anything of me but he soon remembered that he had no money That night all the money we had was consigned to my own pocket because we thought in case there were any pickpockets about a slave's pocket would be the last one they would look for However hoping to meet me some day in a land of liberty and as he had the tickets he thought it best upon the whole to enter the boat and come off to Philadelphia and endeavour to make his way alone in this cold and hollow world as best he could The time was now up so he went on board and came across with feelings that can be better imagined than described After the train had got fairly on the way to Philadelphia the guard came into my car and gave me a violent shake and bawled out at the same time Boy wake up I started almost frightened out of my wits He Your master is scared half to death about you That frightened me still moreI thought they had found him out so I anxiously inquired what was the matter The guard He thinks you have run away from him This made me feel quite at ease I No sir I am satisfied my good master doesn't think that So off I started to see him He had been fearfully nervous but on seeing me he at once felt much better He merely wished to know what had become of me On returning to my seat I found the conductor and two or three other persons amusing themselves very much respecting my running away So the guard Boy what did your master want I may state here that every man slave is called boy till he is very old then the more respectable slaveholders call him uncle The women are all girls till they are aged then they are called aunts This is the reason why Mrs Stowe calls her characters Uncle Tom Aunt Chloe Uncle Tiff c I replied He merely wished to know what had become of me No the man that was not it he thought you had taken French leave for parts unknown I never saw a fellow so badly scared about losing his slave in my life Now continued the guard let me give you a little friendly advice When you get to Philadelphia run away and leave that cripple and have your liberty No sir I indifferently replied I can't promise to do that Why not the conductor evidently much surprised don't you want your liberty Yes sir I replied but I shall never run away from such a good master as I have at present One of the men to the guard Let him alone I guess he will open his eyes when he gets to Philadelphia and see things in another light After giving me a good deal of information which I afterwards found to be very useful they left me alone I also met with a coloured gentleman on this train who recommended me to a boardinghouse that was kept by an abolitionist where he thought I would be quite safe if I wished to run away from my master I thanked him kindly but of course did not let him know who we were Late at night or rather early in the morning I heard a fearful whistling of the steamengine so I opened the window and looked out and saw a large number of flickering lights in the distance and heard a passenger in the next carriagewho also had his head out of the windowsay to his companion Wake up old horse we are at Philadelphia The sight of those lights and that announcement made me feel almost as happy as Bunyan's Christian must have felt when he first caught sight of the cross I like him felt that the straps that bound the heavy burden to my back began to pop and the load to roll off I also looked and looked again for it appeared very wonderful to me how the mere sight of our first city of refuge should have all at once made my hitherto sad and heavy heart become so light and happy As the train speeded on I rejoiced and thanked God with all my heart and soul for his great kindness and tender mercy in watching over us and bringing us safely through As soon as the train had reached the platform before it had fairly stopped I hurried out of my carriage to my master whom I got at once into a cab placed the luggage on jumped in myself and we drove off to the boardinghouse which was so kindly recommended to me On leaving the station my masteror rather my wife as I may now saywho had from the commencement of the journey borne up in a manner that much surprised us both grasped me by the hand and Thank God William we are safe then burst into tears leant upon me and wept like a child The reaction was fearful So when we reached the house she was in reality so weak and faint that she could scarcely stand alone However I got her into the apartments that were pointed out and there we knelt down on this Sabbath and Christmasdaya day that will ever be memorable to usand poured out our heartfelt gratitude to God for his goodness in enabling us to overcome so many perilous difficulties in escaping out of the jaws of the wicked PART II AFTER my wife had a little recovered herself she threw off the disguise and assumed her own apparel We then stepped into the sittingroom and asked to see the landlord The man came in but he seemed thunderstruck on finding a fugitive slave and his wife instead of a young cotton planter and his nigger As his eyes travelled round the room he to me Where is your master I pointed him out The man gravely replied I am not joking I really wish to see your master I pointed him out again but at first he could not believe his eyes he he knew that was not the gentleman that came with me But after some conversation we satisfied him that we were fugitive slaves and had just escaped in the manner I have described We asked him if he thought it would be safe for us to stop in Philadelphia He he thought not but he would call in some persons who knew more about the laws than himself He then went out and kindly brought in several of the leading abolitionists of the city who gave us a most hearty and friendly welcome amongst them As it was in December and also as we had just left a very warm climate they advised us not to go to Canada as we had intended but to settle at Boston in the United States It is true that the constitution of the Republic has always guaranteed the slaveholders the right to come into any of the socalled free States and take their fugitives back to southern Egypt But through the untiring uncompromising and manly efforts of Mr Garrison Wendell Phillips Theodore Parker and a host of other noble abolitionists of Boston and the neighbourhood public opinion in Massachusetts had become so much opposed to slavery and to kidnapping that it was almost impossible for any one to take a fugitive slave out of that State So we took the advice of our good Philadelphia friends and settled at Boston I shall have something to say about our sojourn there presently Among other friends we met with at Philadelphia was Robert Purves Esq a well educated and wealthy coloured gentleman who introduced us to Mr Barkley Ivens a member of the Society of Friends and a noble and generoushearted farmer who lived at some distance in the country This good Samaritan at once invited us to go and stop quietly with his family till my wife could somewhat recover from the fearful reaction of the past journey We most gratefully accepted the invitation and at the time appointed we took a steamer to a place up the Delaware river where our new and dear friend met us with his snug little cart and took us to his happy home This was the first act of great and disinterested kindness we had ever received from a white person The gentleman was not of the fairest complexion and therefore as my wife was not in the room when I received the information respecting him and his antislavery character she thought of course he was a quadroon like herself But on arriving at the house and finding out her mistake she became more nervous and timid than ever As the cart came into the yard the dear good old lady and her three charming and affectionate daughters all came to the door to meet us We got out and the gentleman Go in and make yourselves at home I will see after the baggage But my wife was afraid to approach them She stopped in the yard and to me William I thought we were coming among coloured people I replied It is all right these are the same No she it is not all right and I am not going to stop here I have no confidence whatever in white people they are only trying to get us back to slavery She turned round and I am going right off The old lady then came out with her sweet soft and winning smile shook her heartily by the hand and kindly How art thou my dear We are all very glad to see thee and thy husband Come in to the fire I dare say thou art cold and hungry after thy journey We went in and the young ladies asked if she would like to go upstairs and fix herself before tea My wife No I thank you I shall only stop a little while But where art thou going this cold night Mr Ivens who had just stepped in I don't know was the reply Well then he continued I think thou hadst better take off thy things and sit near the fire tea will soon be ready Yes come Ellen Mrs Ivens let me assist thee as she commenced undoing my wife's bonnetstrings don't be frightened Ellen I shall not hurt a single hair of thy head We have heard with much pleasure of the marvellous escape of thee and thy husband and deeply sympathise with thee in all that thou hast undergone I don't wonder at thee poor thing being timid but thou needs not fear us we would as soon send one of our own daughters into slavery as thee so thou mayest make thyself quite at ease These soft and soothing words fell like balm upon my wife's unstrung nerves and melted her to tears her fears and prejudices vanished and from that day she has firmly believed that there are good and bad persons of every shade of complexion After seeing Sally Ann and Jacob two coloured domestics my wife felt quite at home After partaking of what Mrs Stowe's Mose and Pete called a busting supper the ladies wished to know whether we could read On learning we could not they if we liked they would teach us To this kind offer of course there was no objection But we looked rather knowingly at each other as much as to say that they would have rather a hard task to cram anything into our thick and matured sculls However all hands set to and quickly cleared away the teathings and the ladies and their good brother brought out the spelling and copy books and slates c and commenced with their new and green pupils We had by stratagem learned the alphabet while in slavery but not the writing characters and as we had been such a time learning so little we at first felt that it was a waste of time for any one at our ages to undertake to learn to read and write But as the ladies were so anxious that we should learn and so willing to teach us we concluded to give our whole minds to the work and see what could be done By so doing at the end of the three weeks we remained with the good family we could spell and write our names quite legibly They all begged us to stop longer but as we were not safe in the State of Pennsylvania and also as we wished to commence doing something for a livelihood we did not remain When the time arrived for us to leave for Boston it was like parting with our relatives We have since met with many very kind and hospitable friends both in America and England but we have never been under a roof where we were made to feel more at home or where the inmates took a deeper interest in our wellbeing than Mr Barkley Ivens and his dear family May God ever bless them and preserve each one from every reverse of fortune We finally as I have stated settled at Boston where we remained nearly two years I employed as cabinetmaker and furniture broker and my wife at her needle and as our little earnings in slavery were not all spent on the journey we were getting on very well and would have made money if we had not been compelled by the General Government at the bidding of the slaveholders to break up business and fly from under the Stars and Stripes to save our liberties and our lives In Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Bill an enactment too infamous to have been thought of or tolerated by any people in the world except the unprincipled and tyrannical Yankees The following are a few of the leading features of the above law which requires under heavy penalties that the inhabitants of the free States should not only refuse food and shelter to a starving hunted human being but also should assist if called upon by the authorities to seize the unhappy fugitive and send him back to slavery In no case is a person's evidence admitted in Court in defence of his liberty when arrested under this law If the judge decides that the prisoner is a slave he gets ten dollars but if he sets him at liberty he only receives five After the prisoner has been sentenced to slavery he is handed over to the United States Marshal who has the power at the expense of the General Government to summon a sufficient force to take the poor creature back to slavery and to the lash from which he fled Our old masters sent agents to Boston after us They took out warrants and placed them in the hands of the United States Marshal to execute But the following letter from our highly esteemed and faithful friend the Rev Samuel May of Boston to our equally dear and much lamented friend Dr Estlin of Bristol will show why we were not taken into custody Cornhill Boston November th My dear Mr Estlin I trust that in God's good providence this letter will be handed to you in safety by our good friends William and Ellen Craft They have lived amongst us about two years and have proved themselves worthy in all respects of our confidence and regard The laws of this republican and Christian land tell it not in Moscow nor in Constantinople regard them only as slaveschattelspersonal property But they nobly vindicated their title and right to freedom two years since by winning their way to it at least so they thought But now the slave power with the aid of Daniel Webster and a band of lesser traitors has enacted a law which puts their dearlybought liberties in the most imminent peril holds out a strong temptation to every mercenary and unprincipled ruffian to become their kidnapper and has stimulated the slaveholders generally to such desperate acts for the recovery of their fugitive property as have never before been enacted in the history of this government Within a fortnight two fellows from Macon Georgia have been in Boston for the purpose of arresting our friends William and Ellen A writ was served against them from the United States District Court but it was not served by the United States Marshal why not is not certainly known perhaps through fear for a general feeling of indignation and a cool determination not to allow this young couple to be taken from Boston into slavery was aroused and pervaded the city It is understood that one of the judges told the Marshal that he would not be authorised in breaking the door of Craft's house Craft kept himself close within the house armed himself and awaited with remarkable composure the event Ellen in the meantime had been taken to a retired place out of the city The Vigilance Committee appointed at a late meeting in Fanueil Hall enlarged their numbers held an almost permanent session and appointed various subcommittees to act in different ways One of these committees called repeatedly on Messrs Hughes and Knight the slavecatchers and requested and advised them to leave the city At first they peremptorily refused to do so ''till they got hold of the niggers' On complaint of different persons these two fellows were several times arrested carried before one of our county courts and held to bail on charges of 'conspiracy to kidnap' and of 'defamation' in calling William and Ellen 'slaves' At length they became so alarmed that they left the city by an indirect route evading the vigilance of many persons who were on the lookout for them Hughes at one time was near losing his life at the hands of an infuriated coloured man While these men remained in the city a prominent whig gentleman sent word to William Craft that if he would submit peaceably to an arrest he and his wife should be bought from their owners cost what it might Craft replied in effect that he was in a measure the representative of all the other fugitives in Boston some or in number that if he gave up they would all be at the mercy of the slavecatchers and must fly from the city at any sacrifice and that if his freedom could be bought for two cents he would not consent to compromise the matter in such a way This event has stirred up the slave spirit of the country south and north the United States government is determined to try its hand in enforcing the Fugitive Slave law and William and Ellen Craft would be prominent objects of the slaveholders' vengeance Under these circumstances it is the almost unanimous opinion of their best friends that they should quit America as speedily as possible and seek an asylum in England Oh shame shame upon us that Americans whose fathers fought against Great Britain in order to be FREE should have to acknowledge this disgraceful fact God gave us a fair and goodly heritage in this land but man has cursed it with his devices and crimes against human souls and human rights Is America the 'land of the free and the home of the brave' God knows it is not and we know it too A brave young man and a virtuous young woman must fly the American shores and seek under the shadow of the British throne the enjoyment of 'life liberty and the pursuit of happiness' But I must pursue my plain sad story All day long I have been busy planning a safe way for William and Ellen to leave Boston We dare not allow them to go on board a vessel even in the port of Boston for the writ is yet in the Marshal's hands and he may be waiting an opportunity to serve it so I am expecting to accompany them tomorrow to Portland Maine which is beyond the reach of the Marshal's authority and there I hope to see them on board a British steamer This letter is written to introduce them to you I know your infirm health but I am sure if you were stretched on your bed in your last illness and could lift your hand at all you would extend it to welcome these poor hunted fellowcreatures Henceforth England is their nation and their home It is with real regret for our personal loss in their departure as well as burning shame for the land that is not worthy of them that we send them away or rather allow them to go But with all the resolute courage they have shown in a most trying hour they themselves see it is the part of a foolhardy rashness to attempt to stay here longer I must close and with many renewed thanks for all your kind words and deeds towards us I am very respectfully yours SAMUEL MAY JUN Our old masters having heard how their agents were treated at Boston wrote to Mr Filmore who was then President of the States to know what he could do to have us sent back to slavery Mr Filmore that we should be returned He gave instructions for military force to be sent to Boston to assist the officers in making the arrest Therefore we as well as our friends among whom was George Thompson Esq late MP for the Tower Hamletsthe slave's longtried selfsacrificing friend and eloquent advocate thought it best at any sacrifice to leave the mockfree Republic and come to a country where we and our dear little ones can be truly freeNo one daring to molest or make us afraid But as the officers were watching every vessel that left the port to prevent us from escaping we had to take the expensive and tedious overland route to Halifax We shall always cherish the deepest feelings of gratitude to the Vigilance Committee of Boston upon which were many of the leading abolitionists and also to our numerous friends for the very kind and noble manner in which they assisted us to preserve our liberties and to escape from Boston as it were like Lot from Sodom to a place of refuge and finally to this truly free and glorious country where no tyrant let his power be ever so absolute over his poor trembling victims at home dare come and lay violent hands upon us or upon our dear little boys who had the good fortune to be born upon British soil and reduce us to the legal level of the beast that perisheth Oh may God bless the thousands of unflinching disinterested abolitionists of America who are labouring through evil as well as through good report to cleanse their country's escutcheon from the foul and destructive blot of slavery and to restore to every bondman his Godgiven rights and may God ever smile upon England and upon England's good muchbeloved and deservedlyhonoured Queen for the generous protection that is given to unfortunate refugees of every rank and of every colour and clime On the passing of the Fugitive Slave Bill the following learned doctors as well as a host of lesser traitors came out strongly in its defence The Rev Dr Gardiner Spring an eminent Presbyterian Clergyman of New York well known in this country by his religious publications declared from the pulpit that if by one prayer he could liberate every slave in the world he would not dare to offer it The Rev Dr Joel Parker of Philadelphia in the course of a discussion on the nature of Slavery says What then are the evils inseparable from slavery There is not one that is not equally inseparable from depraved human nature in other lawful relations The Rev Moses Stuart D D late Professor in the Theological College of Andover in his vindication of this Bill reminds his readers that many Southern slaveholders are true Christians That sending back a fugitive to them is not like restoring one to an idolatrous people That though we may pity the fugitive yet the Mosaic Law does not authorize the rejection of the claims of the slaveholders to their stolen or strayed property The Rev Dr Spencer of Brooklyn New York has come forward in support of the Fugitive Slave Bill by publishing a sermon entitled the Religious Duty of Obedience to the Laws which has elicited the highest encomiums from Dr Samuel H Cox the Presbyterian minister of Brooklyn notorious both in this country and America for his sympathy with the slaveholder The Rev W M Rogers an orthodox minister of Boston delivered a sermon in which he says When the slave asks me to stand between him and his master what does he ask He asks me to murder a nation's life and I will not do it because I have a consciencebecause there is a God He proceeds to affirm that if resistance to the carrying out of the Fugitive Slave Law should lead the magistracy to call the citizens to arms their duty was to obey and if ordered to take human life in the name of God to take it and he concludes by admonishing the fugitives to hearken to the Word of God and to count their own masters worthy of all honour The Rev William Crowell of Waterfield State of Maine printed a Thanksgiving Sermon of the same kind in which he calls upon his hearers not to allow excessive sympathies for a few hundred fugitives to blind them so as that they may risk increased suffering to the millions already in chains The Rev Dr Taylor an Episcopal Clergyman of New Haven Connecticut made a speech at a Union Meeting in which he deprecates the agitation on the law and urges obedience to it askingIs that article in the Constitution contrary to the law of Nature of nations or to the will of God Is it so Is there a shadow of reason for saying it I have not been able to discover it Have I not shown you it is lawful to deliver up in compliance with the laws fugitive slaves for the high the great the momentous interests of those Southern States The Right Rev Bishop Hopkins of Vermont in a Lecture at Lockport says It was warranted by the Old Testament and inquires What effect had the Gospel in doing away with slavery None whatever Therefore he argues as it is expressly permitted by the Bible it does not in itself involve any sin but that every Christian is authorised by the Divine Law to own slaves provided they were not treated with unnecessary cruelty The Rev Orville Dewey D D of the Unitarian connexion maintained in his lectures that the safety of the Union is not to be hazarded for the sake of the African race He declares that for his part he would send his own brother or child into slavery if needed to preserve the Union between the free and the slaveholding States and counselling the slave to similar magnanimity thus exhorts himYour right to be free is not absolute unqualified irrespective of all consequences If my espousal of your claim is likely to involve your race and mine together in disasters infinitely greater than your personal servitude then you ought not to be free In such a case personal rights ought to be sacrificed to the general good You yourself ought to see this and be willing to suffer for a whileone for many If the Doctor is prepared he is quite at liberty to sacrifice his personal rights to the general good But as I have suffered a long time in slavery it is hardly fair for the Doctor to advise me to go back According to his showing he ought rather to take my place That would be practically carrying out his logic as respects suffering a whileone for many In fact so eager were they to prostrate themselves before the great idol of slavery and like Baalam to curse instead of blessing the people whom God had brought out of bondage that they in bringing up obsolete passages from the Old Testament to justify their downward course overlooked or would not see the following verses which show very clearly according to the Doctor's own textbook that the slaves have a right to run away and that it is unscriptural for any one to send them back In the rd of Deuteronomy th and th verses it is thus writtenThou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee He shall dwell with thee even among you in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates where it liketh him best thou shalt not oppress him Hide the outcast Bewray not him that wandereth Let mine outcasts dwell with thee Be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoilerIsa xvi The great majority of the American ministers are not content with uttering sentences similar to the above or remaining wholly indifferent to the cries of the poor bondman but they do all they can to blast the reputation and to muzzle the mouths of the few good men who dare to beseech the God of mercy to loose the bonds of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and let the oppressed go free These reverend gentlemen pour a terrible cannonade upon Jonah for refusing to carry God's message against Nineveh and tell us about the whale in which he was entombed while they utterly overlook the existence of the whales which trouble their republican waters and know not that they themselves are the Jonahs who threaten to sink their ship of state by steering in an unrighteous direction We are told that the whale vomited up the runaway prophet This would not have seemed so strange had it been one of the above lukewarm Doctors of Divinity whom he had swallowed for even a whale might find such a morsel difficult of digestion I venerate the man whose heart is warm Whose hands are pure whose doctrines and whose life Coincident exhibit lucid proof That he is honest in the sacred cause But grace abused brings forth the foulest deeds As richest soil the most luxuriant weeds I must now leave the reverend gentlemen in the hands of Him who knows best how to deal with a recreant ministry I do not wish it to be understood that all the ministers of the States are of the Baalam stamp There are those who are as uncompromising with slaveholders as Moses was with Pharaoh and like Daniel will never bow down before the great false God that has been set up On arriving at Portland we found that the steamer we intended to take had run into a schooner the previous night and was lying up for repairs so we had to wait there in fearful suspense for two or three days During this time we had the honour of being the guest of the late and much lamented Daniel Oliver Esq one of the best and most hospitable men in the State By simply fulfilling the Scripture injunction to take in the stranger c he ran the risk of incurring a penalty of dollars and twelve months' imprisonment But neither the Fugitive Slave Law nor any other Satanic enactment can ever drive the spirit of liberty and humanity out of such noble and generoushearted men May God ever bless his dear widow and eventually unite them in His courts above We finally got off to St John's New Brunswick where we had to wait two days for the steamer that conveyed us to Windsor Nova Scotia On going into a hotel at St John's we met the butler in the hall to whom I We wish to stop here tonight He turned round scratching his head evidently much put about But thinking that my wife was white he replied We have plenty of room for the lady but I don't know about yourself we never take in coloured folks Oh don't trouble about me I if you have room for the lady that will do so please have the luggage taken to a bedroom Which was immediately done and my wife went upstairs into the apartment After taking a little walk in the town I returned and asked to see the lady On being conducted to the little sittingroom where she then was I entered without knocking much to the surprise of the whole house The lady then rang the bell and ordered dinner for two Dinner for two mum exclaimed the waiter as he backed out of the door Yes for two my wife In a little while the stout rednosed butler whom we first met knocked at the door I called out Come in On entering he rolled his whisky eyes at me and then at my wife and in a very solemn tone Did you order dinner for two mum Yes for two my wife again replied This confused the chubby butler more than ever and as the landlord was not in the house he seemed at a loss what to do When dinner was ready the maid came in and Please mum the Missis wishes to know whether you will have dinner up now or wait till your friend arrives I will have it up at once if you please Thank you mum continued the maid and out she glided After a good deal of giggling in the passage some one You are in for it butler after all so you had better make the best of a bad job But before dinner was sent up the landlord returned and having heard from the steward of the steamer by which we came that we were bound for England the proprietor's native country he treated us in the most respectful manner At the above house the boots whose name I forget was a fugitive slave a very intelligent and active man about fortyfive years of age Soon after his marriage while in slavery his bride was sold away from him and he could never learn where the poor creature dwelt So after remaining single for many years both before and after his escape and never expecting to see again nor even to hear from his longlost partner he finally married a woman at St John's But poor fellow as he was passing down the street one day he met a woman at the first glance they nearly recognized each other they both turned round and stared and unconsciously advanced till she screamed and flew into his arms Her first words were Dear are you married On his answering in the affirmative she shrank from his embrace hung her head and wept A person who witnessed this meeting told me it was most affecting This couple knew nothing of each other's escape or whereabouts The woman had escaped a few years before to the free States by secreting herself in the hold of a vessel but as they tried to get her back to bondage she fled to New Brunswick for that protection which her native country was too mean to afford The man at once took his old wife to see his new one who was also a fugitive slave and as they all knew the workings of the infamous system of slavery they could as no one else can sympathise with each other's misfortune According to the rules of slavery the man and his first wife were already divorced but not morally and therefore it was arranged between the three that he should live only with the lastly married wife and allow the other one so much a week as long she requested his assistance After staying at St John's two days the steamer arrived which took us to Windsor where we found a coach bound for Halifax Prejudice against colour forced me on the top in the rain On arriving within about seven miles of the town the coach broke down and was upset I fell upon the big crotchety driver whose head stuck in the mud and as he always objected to niggers riding inside with white folks I was not particularly sorry to see him deeper in the mire than myself All of us were scratched and bruised more or less After the passengers had crawled out as best they could we all set off and paddled through the deep mud and cold and rain to Halifax On leaving Boston it was our intention to reach Halifax at least two or three days before the steamer from Boston touched there en route for Liverpool but having been detained so long at Portland and St John's we had the misfortune to arrive at Halifax at dark just two hours after the steamer had gone consequently we had to wait there a fortnight for the Cambria The coach was patched up and reached Halifax with the luggage soon after the passengers arrived The only respectable hotel that was then in the town had suspended business and was closed so we went to the inn opposite the market where the coach stopped a most miserable dirty hole it was Knowing that we were still under the influence of the low Yankee prejudice I sent my wife in with the other passengers to engage a bed for herself and husband I stopped outside in the rain till the coach came up If I had gone in and asked for a bed they would have been quite full But as they thought my wife was white she had no difficulty in securing apartments into which the luggage was afterwards carried The landlady observing that I took an interest in the baggage became somewhat uneasy and went into my wife's room and to her Do you know the dark man downstairs Yes he is my husband Oh I mean the black manthe nigger I quite understand you he is my husband My God exclaimed the woman as she flounced out and banged to the door On going upstairs I heard what had taken place but as we were there and did not mean to leave that night we did not disturb ourselves On our ordering tea the landlady sent word back to say that we must take it in the kitchen or in our bedroom as she had no other room for niggers We replied that we were not particular and that they could send it up to our roomwhich they did After the proslavery persons who were staying there heard that we were in the whole house became agitated and all sorts of oaths and fearful threats were heaped upon the dd niggers for coming among white folks Some of them they would not stop there a minute if there was another house to go to The mistress came up the next morning to know how long we wished to stop We a fortnight Oh dear me it is impossible for us to accommodate you and I think you had better go you must understand I have no prejudice myself I think a good deal of the coloured people and have always been their friend but if you stop here we shall lose all our customers which we can't do nohow We we were glad to hear that she had no prejudice and was such a staunch friend to the coloured people We also informed her that we would be sorry for her customers to leave on our account and as it was not our intention to interfere with anyone it was foolish for them to be frightened away However if she would get us a comfortable place we would be glad to leave The landlady she would go out and try After spending the whole morning in canvassing the town she came to our room and I have been from one end of the place to the other but everybody is full Having a little foretaste of the vulgar prejudice of the town we did not wonder at this result However the landlady gave me the address of some respectable coloured families whom she thought under the circumstances might be induced to take us And as we were not at all comfortablebeing compelled to sit eat and sleep in the same small roomwe were quite willing to change our quarters I called upon the Rev Mr Cannady a truly goodhearted Christian man who received us at a word and both he and his kind lady treated us handsomely and for a nominal charge My wife and myself were both unwell when we left Boston and having taken fresh cold on the journey to Halifax we were laid up there under the doctor's care nearly the whole fortnight I had much worry about getting tickets for they baffled us shamefully at the Cunard office They at first that they did not book till the steamer came which was not the fact When I called again they they knew the steamer would come full from Boston and therefore we had better try to get to Liverpool by other means Other mean Yankee excuses were made and it was not till an influential gentleman to whom Mr Francis Jackson of Boston kindly gave us a letter went and rebuked them that we were able to secure our tickets So when we went on board my wife was very poorly and was also so ill on the voyage that I did not believe she could live to see Liverpool However I am thankful to say she arrived and after laying up at Liverpool very ill for two or three weeks gradually recovered It was not until we stepped upon the shore at Liverpool that we were free from every slavish fear We raised our thankful hearts to Heaven and could have knelt down like the Neapolitan exiles and kissed the soil for we felt that from slavery Heaven sure had kept this spot of earth uncurs'd To show how all things were created first In a few days after we landed the Rev Francis Bishop and his lady came and invited us to be their guests to whose unlimited kindness and watchful care my wife owes in a great degree her restoration to health We enclosed our letter from the Rev Mr May to Mr Estlin who at once wrote to invite us to his house at Bristol On arriving there both Mr and Miss Estlin received us as cordially as did our first good Quaker friends in Pennsylvania It grieves me much to have to mention that he is no more Everyone who knew him can truthfully say Peace to the memory of a man of worth A man of letters and of manners too Of manners sweet as Virtue always wears When gay Goodnature dresses her in smiles It was principally through the extreme kindness of Mr Estlin the Right Hon Lady Noel Byron Miss Harriet Martineau Mrs Reid Miss Sturch and a few other good friends that my wife and myself were able to spend a short time at a school in this country to acquire a little of that education which we were so shamefully deprived of while in the house of bondage The school is under the supervision of the Misses Lushington daughters of the Right Hon Stephen Lushington DCL During our stay at the school we received the greatest attention from every one and I am particularly indebted to Thomas Wilson Esq of Bradmore House Chiswick who was then the master for the deep interest he took in trying to get me on in my studies We shall ever fondly and gratefully cherish the memory of our endeared and departed friend Mr Estlin We as well as the AntiSlavery cause lost a good friend in him However if departed spirits in Heaven are conscious of the wickedness of this world and are allowed to speak he will never fail to plead in the presence of the angelic host and before the great and just Judge for downtrodden and outraged humanity Therefore I cannot think thee wholly gone The better part of thee is with us still Thy soul its hampering clay aside hath thrown And only freer wrestles with the ill Thou livest in the life of all good things What words thou spak'st for Freedom shall not die Thou sleepest not for now thy Love hath wings To soar where hence thy hope could hardly fly And often from that other world on this Some gleams from great souls gone before may shine To shed on struggling hearts a clearer bliss And clothe the Right with lustre more divine Farewell good man good angel now this hand Soon like thine own shall lose its cunning too Soon shall this soul like thine bewildered stand Then leap to thread the free unfathomed blue JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL In the preceding s I have not dwelt upon the great barbarities which are practised upon the slaves because I wish to present the system in its mildest form and to show that the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel But I do now however most solemnly declare that a very large majority of the American slaves are overworked underfed and frequently unmercifully flogged I have often seen slaves tortured in every conceivable manner I have seen them hunted down and torn by bloodhounds I have seen them shamefully beaten and branded with hot irons I have seen them hunted and even burned alive at the stake frequently for offences that would be applauded if committed by white persons for similar purposes In short it is well known in England if not all over the world that the Americans as a people are notoriously mean and cruel towards all coloured persons whether they are bond or free Oh tyrant thou who sleepest On a volcano from whose pentup wrath Already some red flashes bursting up Beware RICHARD BARRETT PRINTER MARK LANE LONDON
Mattie-Jackson,THE STORY OF MATTIE J JACKSON HER PARENTAGE EXPERIENCE OF EIGHTEEN YEARS IN SLAVERY INCIDENTS DURING THE WAR HER ESCAPE FROM SLAVERY A TRUE STORY WRITTEN AND ARRANGED BY DR L S THOMPSON FORMERLY MRS SCHUYLER AS GIVEN BY MATTIE LAWRENCE PRINTED AT SENTINEL OFFICE ESSEX STREET PREFACE The object in publishing this book is to gain sympathy from the earnest friends of those who have been bound down by a dominant race in circumstances over which they had no control a butt of ridicule and a mark of oppression over whom weary ages of degradation have passed As the links have been broken and the shackles fallen from them through the unwearied efforts of our beloved martyr President Lincoln as one I feel it a duty to improve the mind and have ever had a thirst for education to fill that vacuum for which the soul has ever yearned since my earliest remembrance Thus I ask you to buy my little book to aid me in obtaining an education that I may be enabled to do some good in behalf of the elevation of my emancipated brothers and sisters I have now arrived at the age of twenty As the first dawn of morning has passed and the meridian of life is approaching I know of no other way to speedily gain my object than through the aid and patronage of the friends of humanity NOTE Miss Jackson sustains a high moral character has been much respected since she has been in Lawrence She is from St Louis Missouri and arrived here on the th of April To gain the wish of the heart is utterly impossible without more means than she can obtain otherwise Her friends have borne her expenses to Lawrence and have and are still willing to render her aid as far their limited means will allow She was in the same condition of all the neglected and oppressed Her personal requirements are amply supplied She now only craves the means to cloathe and qualify the intellect My humble prayer is that she may meet with unlimited success This young lady is highly worthy of all the aid our kind friends feel a duty to bestow upon her She purposes lecturing and relating her story and I trust she may render due satisfaction and bear some humble part in removing doubts indulged by the prejudices against the natural genius and talent of our race May God give her grace and speed her on her way Respectfully yours L S T MATTIE'S STORY MY ancestors were transported from Africa to America at the time the slave trade flourished in the Eastern States I cannot give dates as my progenitors being slaves had no means of keeping them By all accounts my great grandfather was captured and brought from Africa His original name I never learned His master's name was Jackson and he resided in the State of New York My grandfather was born in the same State and also remained a slave for some length of time when he was emancipated his master presenting him with quite an amount of property He was true honest and responsible and this present was given him as a reward He was much encouraged by the cheering prospect of better days A better condition of things now presented itself As he possessed a large share of confidence he came to the conclusion as he was free that he was capable of selecting his own residence and manage his own affairs with prudence and economy But alas his hopes were soon blighted More heart rending sorrow and degradation awaited him He was earnestly invited by a white decoyer to relinquish his former design and accompany him to Missouri and join him in speculation and become wealthy As partners they embarked on board a schooner for St Charles Mo On the passage my grandfather was seized with a fever and for a while was totally unconscious When he regained his reason he found himself near his journey's end divested of his free papers and all others On his arrival at St Charles he was seized by a huge surly looking slaveholder who claimed him as his property The contract had previously been concluded by his Judas like friend who had received the bounty Oh what a sad disappointment After serving for thirty years to be thrust again into bondage where a deeper degredation and sorrow and hopeless toil were to be his portion for the remaining years of his existence In deep despair and overwhelmed with grief he made his escape to the woods determined to put an end to his sorrows by perishing with cold and hunger His master immediately pursued him and in twenty four hours found him with hands and feet frost bitten in consequence of which he lost the use of his fingers and toes and was thenceforth of little use to his new master He remained with him however and married a woman in the same station in life They lived as happily as their circumstances would permit As Providence allotted they only had one son which was my father Westly Jackson He had a deep affection for his family which the slave ever cherishes for his dear ones He had no other link to fasten him to the human family but his fervent love for those who were bound to him by love and sympathy in their wrongs and sufferings My grandfather remained in the same family until his death My father Westly Jackson married at the age of twenty two a girl owned by James Harris named Ellen Turner Nothing of importance occurred until three years after their marriage when her master Harris failed through the extravagance and mismanagement of his wife who was a great spendthrift and a dreaded terror to the poor slaves and all others with whom she associated in common circumstances consequently the entire stock was sold by the sheriff to a trader residing in Virginia On account of the good reputation my mother sustained as a worthy servant and excellent cook a tyrannical and much dreaded slaveholder watched for an opportunity to purchase her but fortunately arrived a few moments too late and she was bid off in too poor a condition of health to remain long a subject of banter and speculation Her husband was allowed to carefully lift her down from the block and accompany her to her new master's Charles Canory who treated her very kindly while she remained in his family Mr Canory resided in St Charles County for five years after he purchased my mother During that time my father and mother were in the same neighborhood but a short distance from each other But another trial awaited them Her master removed twenty miles away to a village called Bremen near St Louis Mo My father thereafter visited my mother once a week walking the distance every Saturday evening and returning on Sunday evening But through all her trials and deprivations her trust and confidence was in Him who rescued his faithful followers from the fiery furnace and the lion's den and led Moses through the Red Sea Her trust and confidence was in Jesus She relied on His precious promises kind ever found Him a present help in every time of need Two years after this separation my father was sold and separated from us but previous to his delivery to his new master he made his escape to a free State My mother was then left with two children She had three during the time they were permitted to remain together and buried one Their names were Sarah Ann Mattie Jane and Esther J When my father left I was about three years of age yet I can well remember the little kindnesses my father used to bestow upon us and the deep affection and fondness he manifested for us I shall never forget the bitter anguish of my parents' hearts the sighs they uttered or the profusion of tears which coursed down their sable checks O what a horrid scene but he was not her's for cruel hands had separated them The strongest tie of earthly joy that bound the aching heart His love was e'er a joyous light that O'er the pathway shone A fountain gushing ever new amid life's desert wild His slightest word was a sweet tone of music round her heart Their lives a streamlet blent in one O Father must they part They tore him from her circling arms her last and fond embrace O never again can her sad eyes gaze upon his mournful face It is not strange these bitter sighs are constant bursting forth Amid mirth and glee and revelry she never took a part She was a mother left alone with sorrow in her heart But my mother was conscious some time previous of the change that was to take place with my father and if he was sold in the immediate vicinity he would be likely to be sold again at their will and she concluded to assist him to make his escape from bondage Though the parting was painful it afforded her solace in the contemplation of her husband becoming a free man and cherishing a hope that her little family through the aid of some angel of mercy might be enabled to make their escape also and meet to part no more on earth My father came to spend the night with us according to his usual custom It was the last time and sadness brooded upon his brow It was the only opportunity he had to make his escape without suspicion and detection as he was immediately to fall into the hands of a new master He had never been sold from the place of his birth before and was determined never to be sold again if God would verify his promise My father was not educated but was a preacher and administered the Word of God according to the dictation and revelation of the spirit His former master had allowed him the privilege of holding meetings in the village within the limits of his pass on the Sundays when he visited my mother But on this Saturday evening he arrived and gave us all his farewell kiss and hurried away My mother's people were aware of my father's intention but rather than spare my mother and for fear she might be detected they secreted his escape His master called a number of times and enquired for him and strongly pressed my mother to give him an account of my father but she never gave it We waited patiently hoping to learn if he succeeded in gaining his freedom Many anxious weeks and months passed before we could get any tidings from him until at length my mother heard that he was in Chicago a free man and preaching the Gospel He made every effort to get his family but all in vain The spirit of slavery so strongly existed that letters could not reach her they were all destroyed My parents had never learned the rescuing scheme of the underground railroad which had borne so many thousands to the standard of freedom and victories They knew no other resource than to depend upon their own chance in running away and secreting themselves If caught they were in a worse condition than before THEIR ATTEMPT TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE Two years after my father's departure my mother with her two children my sister and myself attempted to make her escape After traveling two days we reached Illinois We slept in the woods at night I believe my mother had food to supply us but fasted herself But the advertisement had reached there before us and loafers were already in search of us and as soon as we were discovered on the brink of the river one of the spies made enquiries respecting her suspicious appearance She was aware that she was arrested consequently she gave a true account of herself that she was in search of her husband We were then destitute of any articles of clothing excepting our wearing apparel Mother had become so weary that she was compelled to leave our package of clothing on the way We were taken back to St Louis and committed to prison and remained there one week after which they put us in Linch's trader's yard where we remained about four weeks We were then sold to William Lewis Mr Lewis was a very severe master and inflicted such punishment upon us as he thought proper However I only remember one severe contest Mr Lewis had with my mother For some slight offence Mrs Lewis became offended and was tartly and loudly reprimanding her when Mr L came in and rashly felled her to the floor with his fist But his wife was constantly pulling our ears snapping us with her thimble rapping us on the head and the sides of it It appeared impossible to please her When we first went to Mr L 's they had a cowhide which she used to inflict on a little slave girl she previously owned nearly every night This was done to learn the little girl to wake early to wait on her children But my mother was a cook as I before stated and was in the habit of roasting meats and toasting bread As they stinted us for food my mother roasted the cowhide It was rather poor picking but it was the last cowhide my mother ever had an opportunity to cook while we remained in his family Mr L soon moved about six miles from the city and entered in partnership with his brother in law The servants were then divided and distributed in both families It unfortunately fell to my lot to live with Mrs Larry my mistress' sister which rendered my condition worse than the first My master even disapproved of my ill treatment and took me to another place the place my mother resided before my father's escape After a short time Mr Lewis again returned to the city My mother still remained as cook in his family After six years' absence of my father my mother married again a man by the name of George Brown and lived with her second husband about four years and had two children when he was sold for requesting a different kind and enough food His master considered it a great insult and declared he would sell him But previous to this insult as he called it may step father was foreman in Mr L 's tobacco factory He was trusty and of good moral habits and was calculated to bring the highest price in the human market therefore the excuse to sell him for the above offence was only a plot The morning this offence occurred Mr L bid my father to remain in the kitchen till he had taken his breakfast After pulling his ears and slapping his face bade him come to the factory but instead of going to the factory he went to Canada Thus my poor mother was again left alone with two more children added to her misery and sorrow to toil on her weary pilgrimage Racked with agony and pain she was left alone again With a purpose nought could move And the zeal of woman's love Down she knelt in agony To ask the Lord to clear the way True she O gracious Lord True and faithful is thy word But the humblest poorest may Eat the crumbs they cast away Though nine long years had passed Without one glimmering light of day She never did forget to pray And has not yet though whips and chains are castaway For thus the blessed Lord I will verify my word By the faith that has not failed Thou hast asked and shall prevail We remained but a short time at the same residence when Mr Lewis moved again to the country Soon after my little brother was taken sick in consequence of being confined in a box in which my mother was obliged to keep him If permitted to creep around the floor her mistress thought it would take too much time to attend to him He was two years old and never walked His limbs were perfectly paralyzed for want of exercise We now saw him gradually failing but was not allowed to render him due attention Even the morning he died she was compelled to attend to her usual work She watched over him for three months by night and attended to her domestic affairs by day The night previous to his death we were aware he could not survive through the approaching day but it made no impression on my mistress until she came into the kitchen and saw his life fast ebbing away then she put on a sad countenance for fear of being exposed and told my mother to take the child to her room where he only lived one hour When she found he was dead she ordered grave clothes to be brought and gave my mother time to bury him O that morning that solemn morning It appears to me that when that little spirit departed as though all heaven rejoiced and angels veiled their faces My mother too in concert joined Her mingled praise with them combined Her little saint had gone to God Who saved him with his precious blood Who Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not THE SOLDIERS AND OUR TREATMENT DURING THE WAR Soon after the war commenced the rebel soldiers encamped near Mr Lewis' residence and remained there one week They were then ordered by General Lyons to surrender but they refused There were seven thousand Union and seven hundred rebel soldiers The Union soldiers surrounded the camp and took them and exhibited them through the city and then confined them in prison I told my mistress that the Union soldiers were coming to take the camp She replied that it was false that it was General Kelly coming to re enforce Gen Frost In a few moments the alarm was heard I told Mrs L the Unionists had fired upon the rebels She replied it was only the salute of Gen Kelley At night her husband came home with the news that Camp Jacskon was taken and all the soldiers prisoners Mrs Lewis asked how the Union soldiers could take seven hundred men when they only numbered the same Mr L replied they had seven thousand She was much astonished and cast her eye around to us for fear we might hear her Her suspicion was correct there was not a word passed that escaped our listening ears My mother and myself could read enough to make out the news in the papers The Union soldiers took much delight in tossing a paper over the fence to us It aggravated my mistress very much My mother used to sit up nights and read to keep posted about the war In a few days my mistress came down to the kitchen again with another bitter complaint that it was a sad affair that the Unionists had taken their delicate citizens who had enlisted and made prisoners of them that they were babes My mother reminded her of taking Fort Sumpter and Major Anderson and serving them the same and that turn about was fair play She then hastened to her room with the speed of a deer nearly unhinging every door in her flight replying as she went that the Niggers and Yankees were seeking to take the country One day after she had visited the kitchen to superintend some domestic affairs as she pretended she became very angry without a word being passed and I think it has come to a pretty pass that old Lincoln with his long legs an old rail splitter wishes to put the Niggers on an equality with the whites that her children should never be on an equal footing with a Nigger She had rather see them dead As my mother made no reply to her remarks she stopped talking and commenced venting her spite on my companion servant On one occasion Mr Lewis searched my mother's room and found a picture of President Lincoln cut from a newspaper hanging in her room He asked her what she was doing with old Lincoln's picture She replied it was there because she liked it He then knocked her down three times and sent her to the trader's yard for a month as punishment My mistress indulged some hopes till the victory of New Orleans when she heard the famous Union song sang to the tune of Yankee Doodle The rebels swore that New Orleans never should be taken But if the Yankees came so near they should not save their bacon That's the way they blustered when they thought they were so handy But Farragut steamed up one day and gave them Doodle Dandy Ben Butler then was ordered down to regulate the city He made the rebels walk a chalk and was not that a pity That's the way to serve them out that's the way to treat them They must not go and put on airs after we have beat them He made the rebel banks shell out and pay the loyal people He made them keep the city clean from pig's sty to church steeple That's the way Columbia speaks let all men believe her That's the way Columbia speaks instead of yellow fever He sent the saucy women up and made them treat us well He helped the poor and snubbed the rich they thought he was the devil Bully for Ben Butler then they thought he was so handy Bully for Ben Butler then Yankee Doodle Dandy The days of sadness for mistress were days of joy for us We shouted and laughed to the top of our voices My mistress was more enraged than ever nothing pleased her One evening after I had attended to my usual duties and I supposed all was complete she in a terrible rage declared I should be punished that night I did not know the cause neither did she She went immediately and selected a switch She placed it in the corner of the room to await the return of her husband at night for him to whip me As I was not pleased with the idea of a whipping I bent the switch in the shape of W which was the first letter of his name and after I had attended to the dining room my fellow servant and myself walked away and stopped with an aunt of mine during the night In the morning we made our way to the Arsenal but could gain no admission While we were wandering about seeking protection the girl's father overtook us and persuaded us to return home We finally complied All was quiet Not a word was spoken respecting our sudden departure All went on as usual I was permitted to attend to my work without interruption until three weeks after One morning I entered Mrs Lewis' room and she was in a room adjoining complaining of something I had neglected Mr L then enquired if I had done my work I told him I had She then flew into a rage and told him I was saucy and to strike me and he immediately gave me a severe blow with a stick of wood which inflicted a deep wound upon my head The blood ran over m clothing which gave me a frightful appcarance Mr Lewis then ordered me to change my clothing immediately As I did not obey be became more enraged and pulled me into another room and threw me on the floor placed his knee on my stomach slapped me on the face and beat me with his fist and would have punished me more had not my mother interfered He then told her to go away or he would compel her to but she remained until he left me I struggled mightily and stood him a good test for a while but he was fast conquering me when my mother came He was aware my mother could usually defend herself against one man and both of us would overpower him so after giving his wife strict orders to take me up stairs and keep me there he took his carriage and drove away But she forgot it as usual She was highly gratified with my appropriate treatment as she called it and retired to her room leaving me to myself I then went to my mother and told her I was going away She bid me go and added May the Lord help you I started for the Arsenal again and succeeded in gaining admittance and seeing the Adjutant He ordered me to go to another tent where there was a woman in similar circumstances cooking When the General found I was there he sent me to the boarding house I remained there three weeks and when I went I wore the same stained clothing as when I was so severely punished which has left a mark on my head which will ever remind me of my treatment while in slavery Thanks be to God though tortured by wrong and goaded by oppression the hearts that would madden with misery have broken the iron yoke MR LEWIS CALLS AT THE BOARDING HOUSE At the expiration of three weeks Mr Lewis called at my boarding house accompanied by his brother in law and enquired for me and the General informed him where I was He then told me my mother was very anxious for me to come home and I returned The General had ordered Mr Lewis to call at headquarters when he told him if he had treated me right I would not have been compelled to seek protection of him that my first appearance was sufficient proof of his cruelty Mr L promised to take me home and treat me kindly Instead of fulfilling his promise he carried me to the trader's yard where to my great surprise I found my mother She had been there during my absence where she was kept for fear she would find me and take my brother and sister and make her escape There was so much excitement at that time by the Union soldiers rendering the fugitives shelter and protection he was aware that if she applied to them as he did not fulfill his promise in my case he would stand a poor chance If my mother made application to them for protection they would learn that he did not return me home and immediately detect the intrigue After I was safely secured in the trader's yard Mr L took my mother home I remained in the yard three months Near the termination of the time of my confinement I was passing by the office when the cook of the Arsenal saw and recognized me and informed the General that Mr L had disobeyed his orders and had put me in the trader's yard instead of taking me home The General immediately arrested Mr L and gave him one hundred lashes with the cow hide so that they might identify him by a scarred back as well as his slaves My mother had the pleasure of washing his stained clothes otherwise it would not have been known My master was compelled to pay three thousand dollars and let me out He then put me to service where I remained seven months after which he came in great haste and took me into the city and put me into the trader's yard again After he received the punishment he treated my mother and the children worse than ever which caused her to take her children and secrete themselves in the city and would have remained undetected had it not been for a traitor who pledged himself to keep the secret But King Whiskey fired up his brain one evening and out popped the secret My mother and sister were consequently taken and committed to the trader's yard My little brother was then eight years of age my sister sixteen and myself eighteen We remained there two weeks when a rough looking man called Capt Tirrell came to the yard and enquired for our family After he had examined us he remarked that we were a fine looking family and bid us retire In about two hours he returned at the edge of the evening with a covered wagon and took my mother and brother and sister and left me My mother refused to go without me and told him she would raise an alarm He advised her to remain as quiet as possible At length she was compelled to go When she entered the wagon there was a man standing behind with his hands on each side of the wagon to prevent her from making her escape She sprang to her feet and gave this man a desperate blow and leaping to the ground she made an alarm The watchmen came to her assistance immediately and there was quite a number of Union policemen guarding the city at that time who rendered her due justice as far as possible This was before the emancipation proclamation was issued After she leaped from the wagon they drove on taking her children to the boat The police questioned my mother She told them that Capt Tirrell had put her children on board the boat and was going to take them to Memphis and sell them into hard slavery They accompanied her to the boat and arrived just as they were casting off The police ordered them to stop and immediately deliver up the children who had been secreted in the Captain's private apartment They were brought forth and returned Slave speculation was forbidden in St Louis at that time The Union soldiers had possession of the city but their power was limited to the suppression of the selling of slaves to go out of the city Considerable smuggling was done however by pretending Unionism which was the case with our family RELEASED FROM THE TRADER'S YARD AND TAKEN TO HER NEW MASTER Immediately after dinner my mother called for me to accompany her to our new home the residence of the Captain together with my brother and sister We fared very well while we were there Mrs Tirrell was insane and my mother had charge of the house We remained there four months The Captain came home only once a week and he never troubled us for fear we might desert him His intention was to smuggle us away before the State became free That was the understanding when he bought us of Mr Lewis as it was not much of an object to purchase slaves while the proclamation was pending and they likely to lose all their property but they would for a trifle purchase a whole family of four or five persons to send out of the State Kentucky paid as much or more than ever for slaves As they pretended to take no part in the rebellion they supposed they would be allowed to keep them without interference Consequently the Captain's intention was to keep as quiet as possible till the excitement concerning us was over and he could get us off without detection Mr Lewis would rather have disposed of us for nothing than have seen us free He hated my mother in consequence of her desire for freedom and her endeavors to teach her children the right way as far as her ability would allow He also held a charge against her for reading the papers and understanding political affairs When he found he was to lose his slaves he could not bear the idea of her being free He thought it too hard as she had raised so many tempests for him to see her free and under her own control He had tantalized her in every possible way to humiliate and annoy her yet while he could demand her services he appreciated and placed perfect confidence in mother and family None but a fiendish slaveholder could have rended an honest Christian heart in such a manner as this Though it was her sad and weary lot to toil in slavery But one thing cheered her weary soul When almost in despair That she could gain a sure relief in attitude of prayer CAPT TIRRELL REMOVES THE FAMILY ANOTHER STRATEGY One day the Captain commenced complaining of the expense of so large a family and proposed to my mother that we should work out and he take part of the pay My mother told him she would need what she earned for my little brother's support Finally the Captain consented and I was the first to be disposed of The Captain took me in his buggy and carried me to the Depot and I was put into a Union family where I remained five months Previous to my leaving however my mother and the Captain entered into a contract he agreeing not to sell us and mother agreeing not to make her escape While she was carrying out her promise in good faith he was plotting to separate us We were all divided except mother and my little brother who remained together My sister remained with one of the rebels but was tolerably treated We all fared very well but it was only the calm before the rending tornado Captain T was Captain of the boat to Memphis from which the Union soldiers had rescued us He commenced as a deck hand on the boat then attained a higher position and continued to advance until he became her Captain At length he came in possession of slaves Then his accomplishments were complete He was a very severe slave master Those mushroon slaveholders are much dreaded as their severity knows no bounds Bondage and torture scourges and chains Placed on our backs indelible stains I stated previously in relating a sketch of my mother's history that she was married twice and both husbands were to be sold and made their escape They both gained their freedom One was living the other died before the war Both made every effort to find us but to no purpose It was some years before we got a correct account of her second husband and he had no account of her except once he heard that mother and children had perished in the woods while endeavoring to make their escape In a few years after his arrival in the free States he married again When about sixteen years of age while residing with her original master my mother became acquainted with a young man Mr Adams residing in a neighboring family whom she much respected but he was soon sold and she lost trace of him entirely as was the common occurrence with friends and companions though united by the nearest ties When my mother arrived at Captain Tirrell's after leaving the boat in her excitement she scarce observed anything except her little group so miraculously saved from perhaps a final separation in this world She at length observed that the servant who was waiting to take her to the Captain's residence in the country was the same man with whom she formed the acquaintance when sixteen years old and they again renewed their acquaintance He had been married and buried his wife It appeared that his wife had been in Captain Tirrell's family many years and he also for some time They had a number of children and Capt Tirrell had sold them down South This cruel blow assisted by severe flogging and other ill treatment rendered the mother insane and finally caused her death In agony close to her bosom she pressed The life of her heart the child of her breast Oh love from its tenderness gathering might Had strengthed her soul for declining age But she is free Yes she has gone from the land of the slave The hand of oppression must rest in the grave The blood hounds have missed the scent of her way The hunter is rifled and foiled of his prey After my mother had left the Captain to take care of herself and child according to agreement with the Captain she became engaged to Mr Adams He had bought himself previously for a large price After they became acquainted the Captain had an excellent opportunity of carrying out his stratagem He commenced bestowing charity upon Mr Adams As he had purchased himself and Capt T had agreed not to sell my mother they had decided to marry at an early day They hired a house in the city and were to commence housekeeping immediately The Captain made him a number of presents and seemed much pleased with the arrangement The day previous to the one set for the marriage while they were setting their house in order a man called and enquired for a nurse pretending he wanted one of us Mother was absent he he would call again but he never came On Wednesday evening we attended a protracted meeting After we had returned home and retired a loud rap was heard at the door My Aunt enquired who was there The reply was Open the door or I will break it down In a moment in rushed seven men four watchmen and three traders and ordered mother to take my brother and me and follow them which she hastened to do as fast as possible but we were not allowed time to put on our usual attire They thrust us into a close carriage For fear of my mother alarming the citizens they threw her to the ground and choked her until she was nearly strangled then pushed her into a coach The night was dark and dreary the stars refused to shine the moon to shed her light 'Tis not strange the heavenly orbs In silence blushed 'neath Nature's sable garb When woman's gagged and rashly torn away Without blemish and without crime Unheeded by God's holy word Unloose the fetters break the chain And make my people free again And let them breath pure freedom's air And her rich bounty freely share Let Eutopia stretch her bleeding hands abroad Her cry f anguish finds redress from God We were hurried along the streets The inhabitants heard our cries and rushed to their doors but our carriage being perfectly tight and the alarm so sudden that we were at the jail before they could give us any relief There were strong Union men and officers in the city and if they could have been informed of the human smuggling they would have released us But oh that horrid dilapidated prison with its dim lights and dingy walls again presented itself to our view My sister was there first and we were thrust in and remained there until three o'clock the following afternoon Could we have notified the police we should have been released but no opportunity was given us It appears that this kidnapping had been in contemplation from the time we were before taken and returned and Captain Tirrell's kindness to mother his benevolence towards Mr Adams in assisting him to furnish his house his generosity in letting us work for ourselves his approbation in regard to the contemplated marriage was only a trap Thus instead of a wedding Thursday evening we were hurled across the ferry to Albany Court House and to Kentucky through the rain and without our outer garments My mother had lost her bonnet and shawl in the struggle while being thrust in the coach consequently she had no protection from the storm and the rest of us were in similar circumstances I believe we passed through Springfield I think it was the first stopping place after we left East St Louis and we were put on board the cars and secreted in the gentlemen's smoking car in which there were only a few rebels We arrived in Springfield about twelve o'clock at night When we took the cars it was dark bleak and cold It was the th of March and as we were without bonnets and clothing to shield us from the sleet and wind we suffered intensely The old trader for fear that mother might make her escape carried my brother nine years of age from one train to the other We then took the cars for Albany and arrived at eight o'clock in the morning We were then carried on the ferry in a wagon There was another family in the wagon in the same condition We landed at Portland from thence to Louisville and were put into John Clark's trader's yard and sold out separately except my mother and little brother who were sold together Mother remained in the trader'syard two weeks my sister six myself four THE FARE AT THEIR NEW HOMES Mother was sold to Captain Plasio my sister to Benj Board and myself to Capt Ephraim Frisbee The man who bought my mother was it Spaniard After she had been there a short time he tried to have my mother let my brother stop at his saloon a very dissipated place to wait upon his miserable crew but my mother objected In spite of her objections he took him down to try him but some Union soldiers called at the saloon and noticing that he vas very small they questioned him and my brother child like divulged the whole matter The Captain fearful of being betrayed and losing his property let him continue with my mother The Captain paid eight hundred dollars for my mother and brother We were all sold for extravagant prices My sister aged sixteen was sold for eight hundred and fifty dollars I was sold for nine hundred dollars This was in My mother was cook and fared very well My sister was sold to a single gentleman whose intended took charge of her until they were married after which they took her to her home She was her waiter and fared as well as could be expected I fared worse than either of the family I was not allowed enough to eat exposed to the cold and not allowed through the cold winter to thoroughly warm myself once a month The house was very large and I could gain no access to the fire I was kept constantly at work of the heaviest kind compelled to move heavy trunks and boxes many times to wash till ten and twelve o'clock at night There were three deaths in the family while I remained there and the entire burden was put upon me I often felt to exclaim as the Children of Israel did O Lord my burden is greater than I can bear I was then seventeen years of age My health has been impaired from that time to the present I have a severe pain in my side by the slightest over exertion In the Winter I suffer intensely with cold and cannot get warm unless in a room heated to eighty degrees I am infirm and burdened with the influence of slavery whose impress will ever remain on my mind and body For six months I tried to make my escape I used to rise at four o'clock in the morning to find some one to assist me and at last I succeeded I was allowed two hours once in two weeks to go and return three miles I could contrive no other way than to improve one of those opportunities in which I was finally successful I became acquainted with some persons who assisted slaves to escape by the underground railroad They were colored people I was to pretend going to church and the man who was to assist and introduce me to the proper parties was to linger on the street opposite the house and I was to follow at a short distance On Sunday evening I begged leave to attend church which was reluctantly granted if I completed all my work which was no easy task It appeared as if my mistress used every possible exertion to delay me from church and I concluded that her old cloven footed companion had impressed his intentions on her mind Finally when I was ready to start my mistress took a notion to go out to ride and desired me to dress her little boy and then get ready for church Extensive hoops were then worn and as I had attached my whole wardrobe under mine by a cord around my waist it required considerable dexterity and no small amount of maneuvering to hide the fact from my mistress While attending to the child I had managed to stand in one corner of the room for fear she might come in contact with me and thus discover that my hoops were not so elastic as they usually are I endeavored to conceal my excitement by backing and edging very genteelly out of the door I had nine pieces of clothing thus concealed on my person and as the string which fastened them was small it caused me considerable discomfort To my great satisfaction I at last passed into the street and my master and mistress drove down the street in great haste and were soon out of sight I saw my guide patiently awaiting me I followed him at a distance until we arrived at the church and there met two young ladies one of whom handed me a pass and told me to follow them at a square's distance It was now twilight There was a company of soldiers about to take passage across the ferry and I followed I showed my pass and proceeded up the stairs on the boat While thus ascending the stairs the cord which held my bundle of clothing broke and my feet became entangled in my wardrobe but by proceeding the first step released one foot and the next the other This was observed only by a few soldiers who were too deeply engaged in their own affairs to interfere with mine I seated myself in a remote corner of the boat and in a few moments I landed on free soil for the first time in my life except when hurled through Albany and Springfield at the time of our capture I was now under my own control The cars were waiting in Jefferson City for the passengers for Indianapolis where we arrived about nine o'clock MATTIE IN INDIANAPOLIS THE GLORY OF FREEDOM PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S REMAINS EXHIBITED My first business after my arrival at Indianapolis was to find a boarding place in which I at once succeeded and in a few hours thereafter was at a place of service of my own choice I had always been under the yoke of oppression compelled to submit to its laws and not allowed to advance a rod from the house or even out of call without a severe punishment Now this constant fear and restless yearning was over It appeared as though I had emerged into a new world or had never lived in the old one before The people I lived with were Unionists and became immediately interested in teaching and encouraging ing me in my literary advancement and all other important improvements which precisely met the natural desires for which my soul had ever yearned since my earliest recollection I could read a little but was not allowed to learn in slavery I was obliged to pay twenty five cents for every letter written for me I now began to feel that as I was free I could learn to write as well as others consequently Mrs Harris the lady with whom I lived volunteered to assist me I was soon enabled to write quite a legible hand which I find a great convenience I would advise all young middle aged or old in a free country to learn to read and write If this little book should fall into the hands of one deficient of the important knowledge of writing I hope they will remember the old maxim Never to old to learn Manage your own secrets and divulge them by the silent language of your own pen Had our blessed President considered it too humiliating to learn in advanced years our race would yet have remained under the galling yoke of oppression After I had been with Mrs Harris seven months the joyful news came of the surrender of Lee's army and the capture of Richmond Whilst the country's hearts were throbbing Filled with joy for victories won Whilst the stars and stripes were waving O'er each cottage ship and dome Came upon like winged lightning Words that turned each joy to dread Froze with horror as we listened Our beloved chieftain Lincoln's dead War's dark clouds has long held o'er us They have rolled their gloomy fold's away And all the world is anxious waiting For that promised peaceful day But that fearful blow inflicted Fell on his devoted head And from every town and hamlet Came the cry our Chieftain's dead Weep weep O bleeding nation For the patriot spirit fled All untold our century's future Buried with the silent dead God of battles God of nations to our country send relief Turn each lamentation into joy whilst we mourn our murdered chief On the Saturday after the assassination of the President there was a meeting held on the Common and a vote taken to have the President's body brought through Indianapolis for the people to see his dear dead face The vote was taken by raising the hands and when the question was put in favor of it a thousand black hands were extended in the air seemingly higher and more visible than all the rest Nor were their hands alone raised for in their deep sorrow and gloom they raised their hearts to God for well they knew that He through martyred blood had made them free It was some time before the remains reached Indianapolis as it was near the last of the route The body was placed in the centre of the hall of the State House and we marched in by fours and divided into twos on each side of the casket and passed directly through the Hall It was very rainy nothing but umbrellas were to be seen in any direction The multitude were passing in and out from eight o'clock in the morning till four o'clock in the afternoon His body remained until twelve o'clock in the evening many distinguished persons visiting it when amid the booming of cannon it moved on its way to Springfield its final resting place The death of the President was like an electric shock to my soul I could not feel convinced of his death until I gazed upon his remains and heard the last roll of the muffled drum and the farewell boom of the cannon I was then convinced that though we were left to the tender mercies of God we were without a leader Gone gone is our chieftain The tried and the true The grief of our nation the world never knew We mourn as a nation has never yet mourned The foe to our freedom more deeply has scorned In the height of his glory in manhood's full prime Our country's preserver through darkest of time A merciful being whose kindness all shared Shown mercy to others Why was he not spared The lover of Justice the friend of the slave He struck at oppression and made it a grave He spoke for our bond men and chain's from them fell By making them soldiers they served our land well Because he had spoken from sea unto sea Glad tidings go heavenward our country is free And angels I'm thinking looked down from above With sweet smiles approving his great works of love His name with the honor forever will live And time to his laurels new lustre will give He lived so unselfish so loyal and true That his deeds will shine brighter at every view Then honor and cherish the name of the brave The champion of freedom the friend to the slave The far sighted statesman who saw a fair end When north land and south land one flag shall defend Rest rest fallen chieftain thy labors are o'er For thee mourns a nation as never before Farewell honored chieftain whom millions adore Farewell gentle spirit whom heaven has won SISTER LOST MOTHER'S ESCAPE In two or three weeks after the body of the President was carried through my sister made her escape but by some means we entirely lost trace of her We heard she was in a free State In three months my mother also escaped She rose quite early in the morning took my little brother and arrived at my place of service in the afternoon I was much surprised and asked my mother how she came there She could scarcely tell me for weeping but I soon found out the mystery After so many long years and so many attempts for this was her seventh she at last succeeded and we were now all free My mother had been a slave for more than forty three years and liberty was very sweet to her The sound of freedom was music in our ears the air was pure and fragrant the genial rays of the glorious sun burst forth with a new lustre upon us and all creation resounded in responses of praise to the author and creator of him who proclaimed life and freedom to the slave I was overjoyed with my personal freedom but the joy at my mother's escape was greater than anything I had ever known It was a joy that reaches beyond the tide and anchors in the harbor of eternal rest While in oppression this eternal life preserver had continually wafted her toward the land of freedom which she was confident of gaining whatever might betide Our joy that we were permitted to mingle together our earthly bliss in glorious strains of freedom was indiscribable My mother responded with the children of Israel The Lord is my strength and my song The Lord is a man of war and the Lord is his name We left Indianapolis the day after my mother arrived and took the cars at eleven o'clock the following evening for St Louis my native State We were then free and instead of being hurried along bare headed and half naked through cars and boats by a brutal master with a bill of sale in his pocket we were our own comfortably clothed and having the true emblems of freedom MOTHER'S MARRIAGE It appeared to me that the city presented an entirely new aspect The reader will remember that my mother was engaged to be married on the evening after we were kidnapped and that Mr Adams her intended had prepared the house for the occasion We now went in search of him He had moved about five miles into the country He had carefully preserved his furniture and was patiently awaiting our return We were gone two years and four months The clothing and furniture which we had collected were all destroyed It was over a year after we left St Louis before we heard from there We went immediately from the cars to my aunt's and from there went to Mr Adams' residence and took him by surprise They were married in a week after our return My mother is comfortably situated on a small farm with a kind and affectionate companion with whom she had formed an early acquaintance and from whom she had been severed by the ruthless hand of Wrong but by the divine hand of Justice they were now reunited forever MATTIE MEETS HER OLD MASTER GOES TO SERVICE IS SENT FOR BY HER STEP FATHER IN LAWRENCE MASS In a short time I had selected a place of service and was improving my studies in a small way The place I engaged was in the family where I was born where my mother lived when my father Jackson made his escape Although Mr Canory's family were always kind to us I felt a great difference between freedom and slavery After I had been there a short time my step father sent for me and my half brother to come to Lawrence He had been waiting ever since the State was free hoping to get some account of us He had been informed previously that mother in trying to make her escape had perished by the way and the children also but he was never satisfied He was aware that my aunt was permanently in St Louis as her master had given her family their freedom twenty years previous She was formerly owned by Major Howe harness and leather dealer yet residing in St Louis And long may he live and his good works follow him and his posterity forever My father well knew the deception of the rebels and was determined to persevere until he had obtained a satisfactory account of his family A gentleman moved directly from Lawrence to St Louis who made particular enquiries for us and even called at my aunt's We then heard directly from my father and commenced correspondence He had not heard directly from us since he made his escape which was nine years He had never heard of his little son who my mother was compelled by Mrs Lewis to confine in a box He was born eight months after he left As soon as possible after my mother consented to let my little brother go to his father he sent means to assist us to make preparations for our journey to the North At first he only sent for his little son My mother was anxious about sending him alone He was only eleven years old and perfectly unused to traveling and had never been away from his mother Finally my father came to the conclusion that as my mother had endured such extreme hardships and sufferings during the nine years he was not permitted to participate or render her any assistance that it would afford him much pleasure in sending for us both bearing our expenses and making us as comfortable as his means would allow Money was sent us and our kind friend Mr Howe obtained our tickets and voluntarily assisted us in starting We left for the North on Monday April th and arrived safe and sound on the th We found my step father's residence about six o'clock in the evening He was not expecting us till the next day Our meeting is better imagined than told I cannot describe it His little son was only two years old when he left and I was eleven and we never expected to meet him again this side of eternity It was Freedom that brought us together My father was comfortably situated in a nice white cottage containing some eight rooms all well furnished and attached to it was a fine garden His wife who is a physician was absent but returned on the following day The people were kind and friendly They informed me there was no other colored family in the city but my step mother was continually crowded with friends and customers without distinction My step mother had buried her only son who returned from the war in a decline The white friends were all in deep sympathy with them I felt immediately at home among such kind and friendly people and have never felt homesick except when I think of my poor mother's farewell embrace when she accompanied us to the cars As soon as my step mother had arrived and our excitement was over they commenced calculating upon placing me in the Sabbath school at the church where my mother belonged On the next Sabbath I accompanied her and joined the Sabbath school she occupying a side seat about middle way up the house I was not reminded of my color except by an occasional loafer or the Irish usually the colored man's enemy I was never permitted to attend a white church before or ride in any public conveyance without being placed in a car for the especial purpose and in the street cars we were not permitted to ride at all either South or West Here I ride where I please without the slightest remark except from the ignorant Many ask me if I am contented They can imagine by the above contrast My brother and myself entered the public school and found a host of interested friends and formed many dear acquaintances whom I shall never forget After attending school a month the term closed I advanced in my studies as fast as could be expected I never attended school but one month before I needed more attention than my kind teacher could possibly bestow upon me encumbered as she was by so many small children Mother then proposed my entering some select school and placing myself entirely under its discipline and influence I was much pleased with the idea but as they had already been to so much expense for me I could not wish to place them under any heavier contribution I had previously told my step mother my story and how often my own mother had wished she could have it published I did not imagine she could find time to write and arrange it but she immediately proposed writing and publishing the entire story by the sale of which I might obtain the aid towards completing my studies I am glad I came to the old Bay State the people of which the rebels hate with an extreme hatred I found it just such a place as I had imagined by the appearance of the soldiers and the kindness they manifested New England that blessed land All in a happy Union band They with the needy share their bread And teach the weak the Word of God We never heard from my sister Hester who made her escape from Kentucky except when she was on the cars though we have no doubt she succeeded in gaining her freedom SUMMARY On my return to St Louis I met my old master Lewis who strove so hard to sell us away that he might avoid seeing us free on the street He was so surprised that before he was aware of it he dropped a bow My mother met Mrs Lewis her old mistress with a large basket on her arm trudging to market It appeared she had lived to see the day when her children had to wait upon themselves and she likewise The Yankees had taken possession and her posterity were on an equality with the black man Mr Lewis despised the Irish and often declared he would board at the hotel before he would employ Irish help but he now has a dissipated Irish cook When I was his slave I was obliged to keep away every fly from the table and not allow one to light on a person They are now compelled to brush their own flies and dress themselves and children Mr Lewis' brother Benjamin was a more severe slave master than the one who owned me He was a tobacconist and very wealthy As soon as the war commenced he turned Unionist to save his property He was very severe in his punishments He used to extend his victim fastened to a beam with hands and feet tied and inflict from fifty to three hundred lashes laying their flesh entirely open then bathe their quivering wounds with brine and through his nose in a slow rebel tone he would tell them You'd better walk a fair chalk line or else I'll give yer twice as much His former friends the guerrillas were aware he only turned Union to save his cash and they gave those persons he had abused a large share of his luxury They then in the presence of his wife and another distinguished lady tortured him in a most inhuman manner For pretending Unionism they placed him on a table and threatened to dissect him alive if he did not tell them where he kept his gold He immediately informed them They then stood him against the house and fired over his head From that they changed his position by turning him upside down and raising him two feet from the floor letting him dash his head against the floor until his skull was fractured after which he lingered awhile and finally died There was a long piece published in the paper respecting his repentance benevolence c All the slaves who ever lived in his family admit the Lord is able to save to the uttermost He saved the thief on the cross and perhaps he saved him When I made my escape from slavery I was in a query how I was to raise funds to bear my expenses I finally came to the conclusion that as the laborer was worthy of his hire I thought my wages should come from my master's pocket Accordingly I took twenty five dollars After I was safe and had learned to write I sent him a nice letter thanking him for the kindness his pocket bestowed to me in time of need I have never received any answer to it When I complete my education if my life is spared I shall endeavor to publish further details of our history in another volume from my own pen CHRISTIANITY Christianity is a system claiming God for its author and the welfare of man for its object It is a system so uniform exalted and pure that the loftiest intellects have acknowledged its influence and acquiesced in the justness of its claims Genius has bent from his erratic course to gather fire from her altars and pathos from the agony of Gethsemane and the sufferings of Calvary Philosophy and science have paused amid their speculative researches and wonderous revelations to gain wisdom from her teachings and knowledge from her precepts Poetry has culled her fairest flowers and wreathed her softest to bind her Author's bleeding brow Music has strung her sweetest lyres and breathed her noblest strains to celebrate His fame whilst Learning has bent from her lofty heights to bow at the lowly cross The constant friend of man she has stood by him in his hour of greatest

fainting heads upon her bosom and gathered strength from her words and courage from her counsels She has been the staff of decrepit age and the joy of manhood in its strength She has bent over the form of lovely childhood and suffered it to have a place in the Redeemer's arms She has stood by the bed of the dying and unveiled the glories of eternal life gilding the darkness of the tomb with the glory of the resurrection Christianity has changed the moral aspect of nations Idolatrous temples have crumbled at her touch and guilt owned its deformity in her presence The darkest habitations of earth have been irradiated with heavenly light and the death shriek of immolated victims changed for ascriptions of praise to God and tho Lamb Envy and Malice have been rebuked by her contented look and fretful Impatience by her gentle and resigned manner At her approach fetters have been broken and men have risen redeemed from dust and freed from chains Manhood has learned its dignity and worth its kindred with angels and alliance to God To man guilty fallen and degraded man she shows a fountain drawn from the Redeemer's veins there she bids him wash and be clean She points him to Mount Zion the city of the living God to an innumerable company of angels to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the Mediator of the new Covenant and urges him to rise from the degradation of sin renew his nature and join with them She shows a pattern so spotless and holy so elevated and pure that he might shrink from it discouraged did she not bring with her a promise from the lips of Jehovah that he would give power to the faint and might to those who have no strength Learning may bring her ample s and her ponderous records rich with the spoils of every age gathered from every land and gleaned from every source Philosophy and science may bring their abstruse researches and wonderous revelations Literature her elegance with the toils of the pen and the labors of the pencil but they are idle tales compared to the truths of Christianity They may cultivate the intellect enlighten the understanding give scope to the imagination and refine the sensibilities but they open not to our dim eyes and longing vision the land of crystal founts and deathless flowers Philosophy searches earth Religion opens heaven Philosophy doubts and trembles at the portals of eternity Religion lifts the veil and shows us golden streets lit by the Redeemer's countenance and irradiated by his smile Philosophy strives to reconcile us to death Religion triumphs over it Philosophy treads amid the pathway of stars and stands a delighted listener to the music of the spheres but Religion gazes on the glorious palaces of God while the harpings of the blood washed and the songs of the redeemed fall upon her ravished ear Philosophy has her place Religion her important sphere one is of importance here the other of infinite and vital importance both here and hereafter Amid ancient lore the Word of God stands unique and preeminent Wonderful in its construction admirable in its adaptation it contains truths that a child may comprehend and mysteries into which angels desire to look It is in harmony with that adaptation of means to ends which pervades creation from the polypus tribes elaborating their coral homes to man the wondrous work of God It forms the brightest link of that glorious chain which unites the humblest work of creation with the throne of the infinite and eternal Jehovah As light with its infinite particles and curiously blended colors is suited to an eye prepared for the alterations of day as air with its subtle and invisible essence is fitted for the delicate organs of respiration and in a word as this material world is adapted to man's physical nature so the word of eternal truth is adapted to his moral nature and mental constitution It finds him wounded sick and suffering and points him to the balm of Gilead and the Physician of souls It finds him stained by transgressions and defiled with guilt and directs him to the blood that cleanseth from all unrighteousness and sin It finds him athirst and faint pining amid the deserts of life and shows him the wells of salvation and the rivers of life It addresses itself to his moral and spiritual nature makes provision for his wants and weaknesses and meets his yearnings and aspirations It is adapted to his mind in its earliest stages of progression and its highest state of intellectuality It provides light for his darkness joy for his anguish a solace for his woes balm for his wounds and heaven for his hopes It unveils the unseen world and reveals him who is the light of creation and the joy of the universe reconciled through the death of His Son It promises the faithful a blessed re union in a land undimmed with tears undarkened by sorrow It affords a truth for the living and a refuge for the dying Aided by the Holy Spirit it guides us through life points out the shoals the quicksands and hidden rocks which endanger our path and at last leaves us with the Eternal God for our refuge and his everlasting arms for our protection 
Mary-Prince,THE HISTORY OF MARY PRINCE A WEST INDIAN SLAVE RELATED BY HERSELF WITH A SUPPLEMENT BY THE EDITOR To which is added THE NARRATIVE OF ASA ASA A CAPTURED AFRICAN By our sufferings since ye brought us To the man degrading mart All sustain'd by patience taught us Only by a broken heart Deem our nation brutes no longer Till some reason ye shall find Worthier of regard and stronger Than the colour of our kind COWPER THIRD EDITION LONDON PUBLISHED BY F WESTLEY AND A H DAVIS STATIONERS' HALL COURT AND BY WAUGH INNES EDINBURGH And supplied at trade price to Anti Slavery Associations by JOSEPH PHILLIPS Aldermanbury Page i PREFACE THE idea of writing Mary Prince's history was first suggested by herself She wished it to be done she said that good people in England might hear from a slave what a slave had felt and suffered and a letter of her late master's which will be found in the Supplement induced me to accede to her wish without farther delay The more immediate object of the publication will afterwards appear The narrative was taken down from Mary's own lips by a lady who happened to be at the time residing in my family as a visitor It was written out fully with all the narrator's repetitions and prolixities and afterwards pruned into its present shape retaining as far as was practicable Mary's exact expressions and peculiar phraseology No fact of importance has been omitted and not a single circumstance or sentiment has been added It is essentially her own without any material alteration farther than was requisite to exclude redundances and gross grammatical errors so as to render it clearly intelligible After it had been thus written out I went over the whole carefully examining her on every fact and circumstance detailed and in all that relates to her residence in Antigua I had the advantage of being assisted in this scrutiny by Mr Joseph Phillips who was a resident in that colony during the same period and had known her there The names of all the persons mentioned by the narrator have been printed in full except those of Capt I and his wife and that of Mr D to whom conduct of peculiar atrocity is ascribed These three individuals are now gone to answer at a far more awful tribunal than that of public opinion for the deeds of which their former bondwoman accuses them and to hold them up more openly to human reprobation could no longer affect themselves while it might deeply lacerate the feelings of their surviving and perhaps innocent relatives without any commensurate public advantage Page ii Without detaining the reader with remarks on other points which will be adverted to more conveniently in the Supplement I shall here merely notice farther that the Anti Slavery Society have no concern whatever with this publication nor are they in any degree responsible for the statements it contains I have published the tract not as their Secretary but in my private capacity and any profits that may arise from the sale will be exclusively appropriated to the benefit of Mary Prince herself While Mary's history was in the press I was furnished by my friend Mr George Stephen with the interesting narrative of Asa Asa a captured African now under his protection and have printed it as a suitable appendix THO PRINGLE London January POSTSCRIPT SECOND EDITION Since the First Edition of this Tract was published Mary Prince has been afflicted with a disease in the eyes which it is feared may terminate in total blindness such at least is the apprehension of some skilful medical gentlemen who have been consulted on the case Should this unfortunately be the result the condition of the poor negro woman thus cruelly and hopelessly severed from her husband and her home will be one peculiarly deserving of commiseration and I mention the circumstance at present on purpose to induce the friends of humanity to promote the more zealously the sale of this publication with a view to provide a little fund for her future benefit Whatever be the subsequent lot that Providence may have in reserve for her the seasonable sympathy thus manifested in her behalf will neither be fruitlessly extended nor unthankfully received while in accordance with the benign scripture mandate it will serve to mitigate and relieve as far as human kindness can the afflictions of the stranger and the exile who is in our and within our gates The present Cheap Edition price s for single copies and d each if or more are ordered is printed expressly to facilitate the circulation of this Tract by Anti slavery Societies T P March Page THE HISTORY OF MARY PRINCE A WEST INDIAN SLAVE Related by herself I WAS born at Brackish Pond in Bermuda on a farm belonging to Mr Charles Myners My mother was a household slave and my father whose name was Prince was a sawyer belonging to Mr Trimmingham a ship builder at Crow Lane When I was an infant old Mr Myners died and there was a division of the slaves and other property among the family I was bought along with my mother by old Captain Darrel and given to his grandchild little Miss Betsey Williams Captain Williams Mr Darrel's son in law was master of a vessel which traded to several places in America and the West Indies and he was seldom at home long together Mrs Williams was a kind hearted good woman and she treated all her slaves well She had only one daughter Miss Betsey for whom I was purchased and who was about my own age I was made quite a pet of by Miss Betsey and loved her very much She used to lead me about by the hand and call me her little nigger This was the happiest period of my life for I was too young to understand rightly my condition as a slave and too thoughtless and full of spirits to look forward to the days of toil and sorrow My mother was a household slave in the same family I was under her own care and my little brothers and sisters were my play fellows and companions My mother had several fine children after she came to Mrs Williams three girls and two boys The tasks given out to us children were light and we used to play together with Miss Betsey with as much freedom almost as if she had been our sister My master however was a very harsh selfish man and we always dreaded his return from sea His wife was herself much afraid of him and during his stay at home seldom dared to shew her usual kindness to the slaves He often left her in the most distressed circumstances to reside in other female society at some place in the West Indies of which I have forgot the name My poor mistress bore his ill treatment with great patience and all her slaves loved and pitied her I was truly attached to her and next to my own mother loved her better than any creature in the world My obedience to her commands was cheerfully Page given it sprung solely from the affection I felt for her and not from fear of the power which the white people's law had given her over me I had scarcely reached my twelfth year when my mistress became too poor to keep so many of us at home and she hired me out to Mrs Pruden a lady who lived about five miles off in the adjoining parish in a large house near the sea I cried bitterly at parting with my dear mistress and Miss Betsey and when I kissed my mother and brothers and sisters I thought my young heart would break it pained me so But there was no help I was forced to go Good Mrs Williams comforted me by saying that I should still be near the home I was about to quit and might come over and see her and my kindred whenever I could obtain leave of absence from Mrs Pruden A few hours after this I was taken to a strange house and found myself among strange people This separation seemed a sore trial to me then but oh 'twas light light to the trials I have since endured 'twas nothing nothing to be mentioned with them but I was a child then and it was according to my strength I knew that Mrs Williams could no longer maintain me that she was fain to part with me for my food and clothing and I tried to submit myself to the change My new mistress was a passionate woman but yet she did not treat me very unkindly I do not remember her striking me but once and that was for going to see Mrs Williams when I heard she was sick and staying longer than she had given me leave to do All my employment at this time was nursing a sweet baby little Master Daniel and I grew so fond of my nursling that it was my greatest delight to walk out with him by the sea shore accompanied by his brother and sister Miss Fanny and Master James Dear Miss Fanny She was a sweet kind young lady and so fond of me that she wished me to learn all that she knew herself and her method of teaching me was as follows Directly she had said her lessons to her grandmamma she used to come running to me and make me repeat them one by one after her and in a few months I was able not only to say my letters but to spell many small words But this happy state was not to last long Those days were too pleasant to last My heart always softens when I think of them At this time Mrs Williams died I was told suddenly of her death and my grief was so great that forgetting I had the baby in my arms I ran away directly to my poor mistress's house but reached it only in time to see the corpse carried out Oh that was a day of sorrow a heavy day All the slaves cried My mother cried and lamented her sore and I foolish creature vainly entreated them to bring my dear mistress back to life I knew nothing rightly about death then and it seemed a hard thing to bear When I thought about my mistress I felt as if the world was all gone wrong and for many days and weeks I could think of nothing else I returned to Mrs Pruden's but my sorrow was too great to be comforted for my own dear mistress was always in my mind Whether in the house or abroad my thoughts were always talking to me about her I staid at Mrs Pruden's about three months after this I was Page then sent back to Mr Williams to be sold Oh that was a sad sad time I recollect the day well Mrs Pruden came to me and said Mary you will have to go home directly your master is going to be married and he means to sell you and two of your sisters to raise money for the wedding Hearing this I burst out a crying though I was then far from being sensible of the full weight of my misfortune or of the misery that waited for me Besides I did not like to leave Mrs Pruden and the dear baby who had grown very fond of me For some time I could scarcely believe that Mrs Pruden was in earnest till I received orders for my immediate return Dear Miss Fanny how she cried at parting with me whilst I kissed and hugged the baby thinking I should never see him again I left Mrs Pruden's and walked home with a heart full of sorrow The idea of being sold away from my mother and Miss Betsey was so frightful that I dared not trust myself to think about it We had been bought of Mr Myners as I have mentioned by Miss Betsey's grandfather and given to her so that we were by right her property and I never thought we should be separated or sold away from her When I reached the house I went in directly to Miss Betsey I found her in great distress and she cried out as soon as she saw me Oh Mary my father is going to sell you all to raise money to marry that wicked woman You are my slaves and he has no right to sell you but it is all to please her She then told me that my mother was living with her father's sister at a house close by and I went there to see her It was a sorrowful meeting and we lamented with a great and sore crying our unfortunate situation Here comes one of my poor picaninnies she said the moment I came in one of the poor slave brood who are to be sold to morrow Oh dear I cannot bear to think of that day it is too much It recalls the great grief that filled my heart and the woeful thoughts that passed to and fro through my mind whilst listening to the pitiful words of my poor mother weeping for the loss of her children I wish I could find words to tell you all I then felt and suffered The great God above alone knows the thoughts of the poor slave's heart and the bitter pains which follow such separations as these All that we love taken away from us Oh it is sad sad and sore to be borne I got no sleep that night for thinking of the morrow and dear Miss Betsey was scarcely less distressed She could not bear to part with her old playmates and she cried sore and would not be pacified The black morning at length came it came too soon for my poor mother and us Whilst she was putting on us the new osnaburgs in which we were to be sold she said in a sorrowful voice I shall never forget it See I am shrouding my poor children what a task for a mother She then called Miss Betsey to take leave of us I am going to carry my little chickens to market these were her very words take your last look of them may be you will see them no more Oh my poor slaves my own slaves said dear Miss Betsey you belong to me and it grieves my heart to part with you Miss Betsey kissed us all and when she left us my mother called the rest of the slaves to bid us good bye One of them a woman named Moll Page came with her infant in her arms Ay said my mother seeing her turn away and look at her child with the tears in her eyes your turn will come next The slaves could say nothing to comfort us they could only weep and lament with us When I left my dear little brothers and the house in which I had been brought up I thought my heart would burst Our mother weeping as she went called me away with the children Hannah and Dinah and we took the road that led to Hamble Town which we reached about four o'clock in the afternoon We followed my mother to the market place where she placed us in a row against a large house with our backs to the wall and our arms folded across our breasts I as the eldest stood first Hannah next to me then Dinah and our mother stood beside crying over us My heart throbbed with grief and terror so violently that I pressed my hands quite tightly across my breast but I could not keep it still and it continued to leap as though it would burst out of my body But who cared for that Did one of the many by standers who were looking at us so carelessly think of the pain that wrung the hearts of the negro woman and her young ones No no They were not all bad I dare say but slavery hardens white people's hearts towards the blacks and many of them were not slow to make their remarks upon us aloud without regard to our grief though their light words fell like cayenne on the fresh wounds of our hearts Oh those white people have small hearts who can only feel for themselves At length the vendue master who was to offer us for sale like sheep or cattle arrived and asked my mother which was the eldest She said nothing but pointed to me He took me by the hand and led me out into the middle of the street and turning me slowly round exposed me to the view of those who attended the vendue I was soon surrounded by strange men who examined and handled me in the same manner that a butcher would a calf or a lamb he was about to purchase and who talked about my shape and size in like words as if I could no more understand their meaning than the dumb beasts I was then put up to sale The bidding commenced at a few pounds and gradually rose to fifty seven Bermuda currency about sterling when I was knocked down to the highest bidder and the people who stood by said that I had fetched a great sum for so young a slave I then saw my sisters led forth and sold to different owners so that we had not the sad satisfaction of being partners in bondage When the sale was over my mother hugged and kissed us and mourned over us begging of us to keep up a good heart and do our duty to our new masters It was a sad parting one went one way one another and our poor mammy went home with nothing Let the reader compare the above affecting account taken down from the mouth of this negro woman with the following description of a vendue of slaves at the Cape of Good Hope published by me in from the letter of a friend and mark their similarity in several characteristic circumstances The resemblance is easily accounted for slavery wherever it prevails produces similar effects Having heard that there was to be a sale of cattle farm stock c by auction at a Veld Cornet's in the vicinity we halted our waggon one day for the purpose of procuring a fresh spann of oxen Among the stock of the farm sold was a female slave and her three children The two eldest children were girls the one about thirteen years of age and the other about eleven the youngest was a boy The whole family were exhibited together but they were sold separately and to different purchasers The farmers examined them as if they had been so many head of cattle While the sale was going on the mother and her children were exhibited on a table that they might be seen by the company which was very large There could not have been a finer subject for an able painter than this unhappy group The tears the anxiety the anguish of the mother while she met the gaze of the multitude eyed the different countenances of the bidders or cast a heart rending look upon the children and the simplicity and touching sorrow of the young ones while they clung to their distracted parent wiping their eyes and half concealing their faces contrasted with the marked insensibility and jocular countenances of the spectators and purchasers furnished a striking commentary on the miseries of slavery and its debasing effects upon the hearts of its abettors While the woman was in this distressed situation she was asked 'Can you feed sheep ' Her reply was so indistinct that it escaped me but it was probably in the negative for her purchaser rejoined in a loud and harsh voice 'Then I will teach you with the sjamboc ' a whip made of the rhinoceros' hide The mother and her three children were sold to three separate purchasers and they were literally torn from each other Ed Page My new master was a Captain I who lived at Spanish Point After parting with my mother and sisters I followed him to his store and he gave me into the charge of his son a lad about my own age Master Benjy who took me to my new home I did not know where I was going or what my new master would do with me My heart was quite broken with grief and my thoughts went back continually to those from whom I had been so suddenly parted Oh my mother my mother I kept saying to myself Oh my mammy and my sisters and my brothers shall I never see you again Oh the trials the trials they make the salt water come into my eyes when I think of the days in which I was afflicted the times that are gone when I mourned and grieved with a young heart for those whom I loved It was night when I reached my new home The house was large and built at the bottom of a very high hill but I could not see much of it that night I saw too much of it afterwards The stones and the timber were the best things in it they were not so hard as the hearts of the owners These strong expressions and all of a similar character in this little narrative are given verbatim as uttered by Mary Prince Ed Before I entered the house two slave women hired from another owner who were at work in the yard spoke to me and asked who I belonged to I replied I am come to live here Poor child poor child they both said you must keep a good heart if you are to live here When I went in I stood up crying in a corner Mrs I came and took off my hat a little black silk hat Miss Pruden made for me and said in a rough voice You are not come here to stand up in corners and cry you are come here to work She then put a child into my arms and tired as I was I was forced instantly to Page take up my old occupation of a nurse I could not bear to look at my mistress her countenance was so stern She was a stout tall woman with a very dark complexion and her brows were always drawn together into a frown I thought of the words of the two slave women when I saw Mrs I and heard the harsh sound of her voice The person I took the most notice of that night was a French Black called Hetty whom my master took in privateering from another vessel and made his slave She was the most active woman I ever saw and she was tasked to her utmost A few minutes after my arrival she came in from milking the cows and put the sweet potatoes on for supper She then fetched home the sheep and penned them in the fold drove home the cattle and staked them about the pond side The cattle on a small plantation in Bermuda are it seems often thus staked tethered both night and day in situations where grass abounds fed and rubbed down my master's horse and gave the hog and the fed cow A cow fed for slaughter their suppers prepared the beds and undressed the children and laid them to sleep I liked to look at her and watch all her doings for her's was the only friendly face I had as yet seen and I felt glad that she was there She gave me my supper of potatoes and milk and a blanket to sleep upon which she spread for me in the passage before the door of Mrs I 's chamber I got a sad fright that night I was just going to sleep when I heard a noise in my mistress's room and she presently called out to enquire if some work was finished that she had ordered Hetty to do No Ma'am not yet was Hetty's answer from below On hearing this my master started up from his bed and just as he was in his shirt ran down stairs with a long cow skin A thong of hard twisted hide known by this name in the West Indies in his hand I heard immediately after the cracking of the thong and the house rang to the shrieks of poor Hetty who kept crying out Oh Massa Massa dead Massa have mercy upon me don't kill me outright This was a sad beginning for me I sat up upon my blanket trembling with terror like a frightened hound and thinking that my turn would come next At length the house became still and I forgot for a little while all my sorrows by falling fast asleep The next morning my mistress set about instructing me in my tasks She taught me to do all sorts of household work to wash and bake pick cotton and wool and wash floors and cook And she taught me how can I ever forget it more things than these she caused me to know the exact difference between the smart of the rope the cart whip and the cow skin when applied to my naked body by her own cruel hand And there was scarcely any punishment more dreadful than the blows received on my face and head from her hard heavy fist She was a fearful woman and a savage mistress to her slaves There were two little slave boys in the house on whom she vented her bad temper in a special manner One of these children was a mulatto called Cyrus who had been bought while an infant in his mother's arms the other Jack was an African from the coast of Guinea whom a sailor had given or sold to my master Seldom a day passed without Page these boys receiving the most severe treatment and often for no fault at all Both my master and mistress seemed to think that they had a right to ill use them at their pleasure and very often accompanied their commands with blows whether the children were behaving well or ill I have seen their flesh ragged and raw with licks Lick lick they were never secure one moment from a blow and their lives were passed in continual fear My mistress was not contented with using the whip but often pinched their cheeks and arms in the most cruel manner My pity for these poor boys was soon transferred to myself for I was licked and flogged and pinched by her pitiless fingers in the neck and arms exactly as they were To strip me naked to hang me up by the wrists and lay my flesh open with the cow skin was an ordinary punishment for even a slight offence My mistress often robbed me too of the hours that belong to sleep She used to sit up very late frequently even until morning and I had then to stand at a bench and wash during the greater part of the night or pick wool and cotton and often I have dropped down overcome by sleep and fatigue till roused from a state of stupor by the whip and forced to start up to my tasks Poor Hetty my fellow slave was very kind to me and I used to call her my Aunt but she led a most miserable life and her death was hastened at least the slaves all believed and said so by the dreadful chastisement she received from my master during her pregnancy It happened as follows One of the cows had dragged the rope away from the stake to which Hetty had fastened it and got loose My master flew into a terrible passion and ordered the poor creature to be stripped quite naked notwithstanding her pregnancy and to be tied up to a tree in the yard He then flogged her as hard as he could lick both with the whip and cow skin till she was all over streaming with blood He rested and then beat her again and again Her shrieks were terrible The consequence was that poor Hetty was brought to bed before her time and was delivered after severe labour of a dead child She appeared to recover after her confinement so far that she was repeatedly flogged by both master and mistress afterwards but her former strength never returned to her Ere long her body and limbs swelled to a great size and she lay on a mat in the kitchen till the water burst out of her body and she died All the slaves said that death was a good thing for poor Hetty but I cried very much for her death The manner of it filled me with horror I could not bear to think about it yet it was always present to my mind for many a day After Hetty died all her labours fell upon me in addition to my own I had now to milk eleven cows every morning before sunrise sitting among the damp weeds to take care of the cattle as well as the children and to do the work of the house There was no end to my toils no end to my blows I lay down at night and rose up in the morning in fear and sorrow and often wished that like poor Hetty I could escape from this cruel bondage and be at rest in the grave But the hand of that God whom then I knew not was stretched over me and I was mercifully preserved for better things It was then however my heavy lot to weep weep weep and that for years to pass from one Page misery to another and from one cruel master to a worse But I must go on with the thread of my story One day a heavy squall of wind and rain came on suddenly and my mistress sent me round the corner of the house to empty a large earthen jar The jar was already cracked with an old deep crack that divided it in the middle and in turning it upside down to empty it it parted in my hand I could not help the accident but I was dreadfully frightened looking forward to a severe punishment I ran crying to my mistress O mistress the jar has come in two You have broken it have you she replied come directly here to me I came trembling she stripped and flogged me long and severely with the cow skin as long as she had strength to use the lash for she did not give over till she was quite tired When my master came home at night she told him of my fault and oh frightful how he fell a swearing After abusing me with every ill name he could think of too too bad to speak in England and giving me several heavy blows with his hand he said I shall come home to morrow morning at twelve on purpose to give you a round hundred He kept his word Oh sad for me I cannot easily forget it He tied me up upon a ladder and gave me a hundred lashes with his own hand and master Benjy stood by to count them for him When he had licked me for some time he sat down to take breath then after resting he beat me again and again until he was quite wearied and so hot for the weather was very sultry that he sank back in his chair almost like to faint While my mistress went to bring him drink there was a dreadful earthquake Part of the roof fell down and every thing in the house went clatter clatter clatter Oh I thought the end of all things near at hand and I was so sore with the flogging that I scarcely cared whether I lived or died The earth was groaning and shaking every thing tumbling about and my mistress and the slaves were shrieking and crying out The earthquake the earthquake It was an awful day for us all During the confusion I crawled away on my hands and knees and laid myself down under the steps of the piazza in front of the house I was in a dreadful state my body all blood and bruises and I could not help moaning piteously The other slaves when they saw me shook their heads and said Poor child poor child I lay there till the morning careless of what might happen for life was very weak in me and I wished more than ever to die But when we are very young death always seems a great way off and it would not come that night to me The next morning I was forced by my master to rise and go about my usual work though my body and limbs were so stiff and sore that I could not move without the greatest pain Nevertheless even after all this severe punishment I never heard the last of that jar my mistress was always throwing it in my face Some little time after this one of the cows got loose from the stake and eat one of the sweet potatoe slips I was milking when my master found it out He came to me and without any more ado stooped down and taking off his heavy boot he struck me such a severe blow in the small of my back that I shrieked with agony and thought I was killed and I feel a weakness in that part to this day The cow was Page frightened at his violence and kicked down the pail and spilt the milk all about My master knew that this accident was his own fault but he was so enraged that he seemed glad of an excuse to go on with his ill usage I cannot remember how many licks he gave me then but he beat me till I was unable to stand and till he himself was weary After this I ran away and went to my mother who was living with Mr Richard Darrel My poor mother was both grieved and glad to see me grieved because I had been so ill used and glad because she had not seen me for a long long while She dared not receive me into the house but she hid me up in a hole in the rocks near and brought me food at night after every body was asleep My father who lived at Crow Lane over the salt water channel at last heard of my being hid up in the cavern and he came and took me back to my master Oh I was loth loth to go back but as there was no remedy I was obliged to submit When we got home my poor father said to Capt I Sir I am sorry that my child should be forced to run away from her owner but the treatment she has received is enough to break her heart The sight of her wounds has nearly broke mine I entreat you for the love of God to forgive her for running away and that you will be a kind master to her in future Capt I said I was used as well as I deserved and that I ought to be punished for running away I then took courage and said that I could stand the floggings no longer that I was weary of my life and therefore I had run away to my mother but mothers could only weep and mourn over their children they could not save them from cruel masters from the whip the rope and the cowskin He told me to hold my tongue and go about my work or he would find a way to settle me He did not however flog me that day For five years after this I remained in his house and almost daily received the same harsh treatment At length he put me on board a sloop and to my great joy sent me away to Turk's Island I was not permitted to see my mother or father or poor sisters and brothers to say good bye though going away to a strange land and might never see them again Oh the Buckra people who keep slaves think that black people are like cattle without natural affection But my heart tells me it is far otherwise We were nearly four weeks on the voyage which was unusually long Sometimes we had a light breeze sometimes a great calm and the ship made no way so that our provisions and water ran very low and we were put upon short allowance I should almost have been starved had it not been for the kindness of a black man called Anthony and his wife who had brought their own victuals and shared them with me When we went ashore at the Grand Quay the captain sent me to the house of my new master Mr D to whom Captain I had sold me Grand Quay is a small town upon a sandbank the houses low and built of wood Such was my new master's The first person I saw on my arrival was Mr D a stout sulky looking man who carried me through the hall to show me to his wife and children Next day I was put up by the vendue master to know how much I was worth and I was valued at one hundred pounds currency Page My new master was one of the owners or holders of the salt ponds and he received a certain sum for every slave that worked upon his premises whether they were young or old This sum was allowed him out of the profits arising from the salt works I was immediately sent to work in the salt water with the rest of the slaves This work was perfectly new to me I was given a half barrel and a shovel and had to stand up to my knees in the water from four o'clock in the morning till nine when we were given some Indian corn boiled in water which we were obliged to swallow as fast as we could for fear the rain should come on and melt the salt We were then called again to our tasks and worked through the heat of the day the sun flaming upon our heads like fire and raising salt blisters in those parts which were not completely covered Our feet and legs from standing in the salt water for so many hours soon became full of dreadful boils which eat down in some cases to the very bone afflicting the sufferers with great torment We came home at twelve ate our corn soup called blawly as fast as we could and went back to our employment till dark at night We then shovelled up the salt in large heaps and went down to the sea where we washed the pickle from our limbs and cleaned the barrows and shovels from the salt When we returned to the house our master gave us each our allowance of raw Indian corn which we pounded in a mortar and boiled in water for our suppers We slept in a long shed divided into narrow slips like the stalls used for cattle Boards fixed upon stakes driven into the ground without mat or covering were our only beds On Sundays after we had washed the salt bags and done other work required of us we went into the bush and cut the long soft grass of which we made trusses for our legs and feet to rest upon for they were so full of the salt boils that we could get no rest lying upon the bare boards Though we worked from morning till night there was no satisfying Mr D I hoped when I left Capt I that I should have been better off but I found it was but going from one butcher to another There was this difference between them my former master used to beat me while raging and foaming with passion Mr D was usually quite calm He would stand by and give orders for a slave to be cruelly whipped and assist in the punishment without moving a muscle of his face walking about and taking snuff with the greatest composure Nothing could touch his hard heart neither sighs nor tears nor prayers nor streaming blood he was deaf to our cries and careless of our sufferings Mr D has often stripped me naked hung me up by the wrists and beat me with the cow skin with his own hand till my body was raw with gashes Yet there was nothing very remarkable in this for it might serve as a sample of the common usage of the slaves on that horrible island Owing to the boils in my feet I was unable to wheel the barrow fast through the sand which got into the sores and made me stumble at every step and my master having no pity for my sufferings from this cause rendered them far more intolerable by chastising me for not being able to move so fast as he wished me Another of our employments was to row a little way off from the shore in a boat and dive Page for large stones to build a wall round our master's house This was very hard work and the great waves breaking over us continually made us often so giddy that we lost our footing and were in danger of being drowned Ah poor me my tasks were never ended Sick or well it was work work work After the diving season was over we were sent to the South Creek with large bills to cut up mangoes to burn lime with Whilst one party of slaves were thus employed another were sent to the other side of the island to break up coral out of the sea When we were ill let our complaint be what it might the only medicine given to us was a great bowl of hot salt water with salt mixed with it which made us very sick If we could not keep up with the rest of the gang of slaves we were put in the stocks and severely flogged the next morning Yet not the less our master expected after we had thus been kept from our rest and our limbs rendered stiff and sore with ill usage that we should still go through the ordinary tasks of the day all the same Sometimes we had to work all night measuring salt to load a vessel or turning a machine to draw water out of the sea for the salt making Then we had no sleep no rest but were forced to work as fast as we could and go on again all next day the same as usual Work work work Oh that Turk's Island was a horrible place The people in England I am sure have never found out what is carried on there Cruel horrible place Mr D had a slave called old Daniel whom he used to treat in the most cruel manner Poor Daniel was lame in the hip and could not keep up with the rest of the slaves and our master would order him to be stripped and laid down on the ground and have him beaten with a rod of rough briar till his skin was quite red and raw He would then call for a bucket of salt and fling upon the raw flesh till the man writhed on the ground like a worm and screamed aloud with agony This poor man's wounds were never healed and I have often seen them full of maggots which increased his torments to an intolerable degree He was an object of pity and terror to the whole gang of slaves and in his wretched case we saw each of us our own lot if we should live to be as old Oh the horrors of slavery How the thought of it pains my heart But the truth ought to be told of it and what my eyes have seen I think it is my duty to relate for few people in England know what slavery is I have been a slave I have felt what a slave feels and I know what a slave knows and I would have all the good people in England to know it too that they may break our chains and set us free Mr D had another slave called Ben He being very hungry stole a little rice one night after he came in from work and cooked it for his supper But his master soon discovered the theft locked him up all night and kept him without food till one o'clock the next day He then hung Ben up by his hands and beat him from time to time till the slaves came in at night We found the poor creature hung up when we came home with a pool of blood beneath him and our master still licking him But this was not the worst My master's son was in the habit of stealing the rice and rum Ben had seen him do this and thought he might do the same and when master found out that Ben Page had stolen the rice and swore to punish him he tried to excuse himself by saying that Master Dickey did the same thing every night The lad denied it to his father and was so angry with Ben for informing against him that out of revenge he ran and got a bayonet and whilst the poor wretch was suspended by his hands and writhing under his wounds he run it quite through his foot I was not by when he did it but I saw the wound when I came home and heard Ben tell the manner in which it was done I must say something more about this cruel son of a cruel father He had no heart no fear of God he had been brought up by a bad father in a bad path and he delighted to follow in the same steps There was a little old woman among the slaves called Sarah who was nearly past work and Master Dickey being the overseer of the slaves just then this poor creature who was subject to several bodily infirmities and was not quite right in her head did not wheel the barrow fast enough to please him He threw her down on the ground and after beating her severely he took her up in his arms and flung her among the prickly pear bushes which are all covered over with sharp venomous prickles By this her naked flesh was so grievously wounded that her body swelled and festered all over and she died a few days after In telling my own sorrows I cannot pass by those of my fellow slaves for when I think of my own griefs I remember theirs I think it was about ten years I had worked in the salt ponds at Turk's Island when my master left off business and retired to a house he had in Bermuda leaving his son to succeed him in the island He took me with him to wait upon his daughters and I was joyful for I was sick sick of Turk's Island and my heart yearned to see my native place again my mother and my kindred I had seen my poor mother during the time I was a slave in Turk's Island One Sunday morning I was on the beach with some of the slaves and we saw a sloop come in loaded with slaves to work in the salt water We got a boat and went aboard When I came upon the deck I asked the black people Is there any one here for me Yes they said your mother I thought they said this in jest I could scarcely believe them for joy but when I saw my poor mammy my joy was turned to sorrow for she had gone from her senses Mammy I said is this you She did not know me Mammy I said what's the matter She began to talk foolishly and said that she had been under the vessel's bottom They had been overtaken by a violent storm at sea My poor mother had never been on the sea before and she was so ill that she lost her senses and it was long before she came quite to herself again She had a sweet child with her a little sister I had never seen about four years of age called Rebecca I took her on shore with me for I felt I should love her directly and I kept her with me a week Poor little thing her's has been a sad life and continues so to this day My mother worked for some years on the island but was taken back to Bermuda some time before my master carried me again thither Of the subsequent lot of her relatives she can tell but little She says her father died while she and her mother were at Turk's Island and that he had been long dead and buried before any of his children in Bermuda knew of it they being slaves on other estates Her mother died after Mary went to Antigua Of the fate of the rest of her kindred seven brothers and three sisters she knows nothing further than this that the eldest sister who had several children to her master was taken by him to Trinidad and that the youngest Rebecca is still alive and in slavery in Bermuda Mary herself is now about forty three years of age Ed Page After I left Turk's Island I was told by some negroes that came over from it that the poor slaves had built up a place with boughs and leaves where they might meet for prayers but the white people pulled it down twice and would not allow them even a shed for prayers A flood came down soon after and washed away many houses filled the place with sand and overflowed the ponds and I do think that this was for their wickedness for the Buckra men Negro term for white people there were very wicked I saw and heard much that was very very bad at that place I was several years the slave of Mr D after I returned to my native place Here I worked in the grounds My work was planting and hoeing sweet potatoes Indian corn plaintains bananas cabbages pumpkins onions c I did all the household work and attended upon a horse and cow besides going also upon all errands I had to curry the horse to clean and feed him and sometimes to ride him a little I had more than enough to do but still it was not so very bad as Turk's Island My old master often got drunk and then he would get in a fury with his daughter and beat her till she was not fit to be seen I remember on one occasion I had gone to fetch water and when I was coming up the hill I heard a great screaming I ran as fast as I could to the house put down the water and went into the chamber where I found my master beating Miss D dreadfully I strove with all my strength to get her away from him for she was all black and blue with bruises He had beat her with his fist and almost killed her The people gave me credit for getting her away He turned round and began to lick me Then I said Sir this is not Turk's Island I can't repeat his answer the words were too wicked too bad to say He wanted to treat me the same in Bermuda as he had done in Turk's Island He had an ugly fashion of stripping himself quite naked and ordering me then to wash him in a tub of water This was worse to me than all the licks Sometimes when he called me to wash him I would not come my eyes were so full of shame He would then come to beat me One time I had plates and knives in my hand and I dropped both plates and knives and some of the plates were broken He struck me so severely for this that at last I defended myself for I thought it was high time to do so I then told him I would not live longer with him for he was a very indecent man very spiteful and too indecent with no shame for his servants no shame for his own flesh So I went away to a neighbouring house and sat down and cried till the next morning when I went home again not knowing what else to do After that I was hired to work at Cedar Hills and every Saturday night I paid the money to my master I had plenty of work to do there Page plenty of washing but yet I made myself pretty comfortable I earned two dollars and a quarter a week which is twenty pence a day During the time I worked there I heard that Mr John Wood was going to Antigua I felt a great wish to go there and I went to Mr D and asked him to let me go in Mr Wood's service Mr Wood did not then want to purchase me it was my own fault that I came under him I was so anxious to go It was ordained to be I suppose God led me there The truth is I did not wish to be any longer the slave of my indecent master Mr Wood took me with him to Antigua to the town of St John's where he lived This was about fifteen years ago He did not then know whether I was to be sold but Mrs Wood found that I could work and she wanted to buy me Her husband then wrote to my master to inquire whether I was to be sold Mr D wrote in reply that I should not be sold to any one that would treat me ill It was strange he should say this when he had treated me so ill himself So I was purchased by Mr Wood for dollars or Bermuda currency About s sterling My work there was to attend the chambers and nurse the child and to go down to the pond and wash clothes But I soon fell ill of the rheumatism and grew so very lame that I was forced to walk with a stick I got the Saint Anthony's fire also in my left leg and became quite a cripple No one cared much to come near me and I was ill a long long time for several months I could not lift the limb I had to lie in a little old out house that was swarming with bugs and other vermin which tormented me greatly but I had no other place to lie in I got the rheumatism by catching cold at the pond side from washing in the fresh water in the salt water I never got cold The person who lived in next yard a Mrs Greene could not bear to hear my cries and groans She was kind and used to send an old slave woman to help me who sometimes brought me a little soup When the doctor found I was so ill he said I must be put into a bath of hot water The old slave got the bark of some bush that was good for the pains which she boiled in the hot water and every night she came and put me into the bath and did what she could for me I don't know what I should have done or what would have become of me had it not been for her My mistress it is true did send me a little food but no one from our family came near me but the cook who used to shove my food in at the door and say Molly Molly there's your dinner My mistress did not care to take any trouble about me and if the Lord had not put it into the hearts of the neighbours to be kind to me I must I really think have lain and died It was a long time before I got well enough to work in the house Mrs Wood in the meanwhile hired a mulatto woman to nurse the child but she was such a fine lady she wanted to be mistress over me I thought it very hard for a coloured woman to have rule over me because I was a slave and she was free Her name was Martha Wilcox she was a saucy woman very saucy and she went and complained of Page me without cause to my mistress and made her angry with me Mrs Wood told me that if I did not mind what I was about she would get my master to strip me and give me fifty lashes You have been used to the whip she said and you shall have it here This was the first time she threatened to have me flogged and she gave me the threatening so strong of what she would have done to me that I thought I should have fallen down at her feet I was so vexed and hurt by her words The mulatto woman was rejoiced to have power to keep me down She was constantly making mischief there was no living for the slaves no peace after she came I was also sent by Mrs Wood to be put in the Cage one night and was next morning flogged by the magistrate's order at her desire and this all for a quarrel I had about a pig with another slave woman I was flogged on my naked back on this occasion although I was in no fault after all for old Justice Dyett when we came before him said that I was in the right and ordered the pig to be given to me This was about two or three years after I came to Antigua When we moved from the middle of the town to the Point I used to be in the house and do all the work and mind the children though still very ill with the rheumatism Every week I had to wash two large bundles of clothes as much as a boy could help me to lift but I could give no satisfaction My mistress was always abusing and fretting after me It is not possible to tell all her ill language One day she followed me foot after foot scolding and rating me I bore in silence a great deal of ill words at last my heart was quite full and I told her that she ought not to use me so that when I was ill I might have lain and died for what she cared and no one would then come near me to nurse me because they were afraid of my mistress This was a great affront She called her husband and told him what I had said He flew into a passion but did not beat me then he only abused and swore at me and then gave me a note and bade me go and look for an owner Not that he meant to sell me but he did this to please his wife and to frighten me I went to Adam White a cooper a free black who had money and asked him to buy me He went directly to Mr Wood but was informed that I was not to be sold The next day my master whipped me Another time about five years ago my mistress got vexed with me because I fell sick and I could not keep on with my work She complained to her husband and he sent me off again to look for an owner I went to a Mr Burchell showed him the note and asked him to buy me for my own benefit for I had saved about dollars and hoped with a little help to purchase my freedom He accordingly went to my master Mr Wood he said Molly has brought me a note that she wants an owner If you intend to sell her I may as well buy her as another My master put him off and said that he did not mean to sell me I was very sorry at this for I had no comfort with Mrs Wood and I wished greatly to get my freedom The way in which I made my money was this When my master and mistress went from home as they sometimes did and left me to take care of the house and premises I had a good deal of time to myself and made the most of it I took in washing and sold coffee and yams Page and other provisions to the captains of ships I did not sit still idling during the absence of my owners for I wanted by all honest means to earn money to buy my freedom Sometimes I bought a hog cheap on board ship and sold it for double the money on shore and I also earned a good deal by selling coffee By this means I by degrees acquired a little cash A gentleman also lent me some to help to buy my freedom but when I could not get free he got it back again His name was Captain Abbot My master and mistress went on one occasion into the country to Date Hill for change of air and carried me with them to take charge of the children and to do the work of the house While I was in the country I saw how the field negroes are worked in Antigua They are worked very hard and fed but scantily They are called out to work before daybreak and come home after dark and then each has to heave his bundle of grass for the cattle in the pen Then on Sunday morning each slave has to go out and gather a large bundle of grass and when they bring it home they have all to sit at the manager's door and wait till he come out often have they to wait there till past eleven o'clock without any breakfast After that those that have yams or potatoes or fire wood to sell hasten to market to buy a dog's worth A dog is the nd part of a dollar of salt fish or pork which is a great treat for them Some of them buy a little pickle out of the shad barrels which they call sauce to season their yams and Indian corn It is very wrong I know to work on Sunday or go to market but will not God call the Buckra men to answer for this on the great day of judgment since they will give the slaves no other day While we were at Date Hill Christmas came and the slave woman who had the care of the place which then belonged to Mr Roberts the marshal asked me to go with her to her husband's house to a Methodist meeting for prayer at a plantation called Winthorps I went and they were the first prayers I ever understood One woman prayed and then they all sung a hymn then there was another prayer and another hymn and then they all spoke by turns of their own griefs as sinners The husband of the woman I went with was a black driver His name was Henry He confessed that he had treated the slaves very cruelly but said that he was compelled to obey the orders of his master He prayed them all to forgive him and he prayed that God would forgive him He said it was a horrid thing for a ranger The head negro of an estate a person who has the chief superintendence under the manager to have sometimes to beat his own wife or sister but he must do so if ordered by his master I felt sorry for my sins also I cried the whole night but I was too much ashamed to speak I prayed God to forgive me This meeting had a great impression on my mind and led my spirit to the Moravian church so that when I got back to town I went and prayed to have my name put down in the Missionaries' book and I followed the church earnestly every opportunity I did not then tell my mistress about it for I knew that she would not give me leave to go But I felt I must go Page Whenever I carried the children their lunch at school I ran round and went to hear the teachers The Moravian ladies Mrs Richter Mrs Olufsen and Mrs Sauter taught me to read in the class and I got on very fast In this class there were all sorts of people old and young grey headed folks and children but most of them were free people After we had done spelling we tried to read in the Bible After the reading was over the missionary gave out a hymn for us to sing I dearly loved to go to the church it was so solemn I never knew rightly that I had much sin till I went there When I found out that I was a great sinner I was very sorely grieved and very much frightened I used to pray God to pardon my sins for Christ's sake and forgive me for every thing I had done amiss and when I went home to my work I always thought about what I had heard from the missionaries and wished to be good that I might go to heaven After a while I was admitted a candidate for the holy Communion I had been baptized long before this in the year by the Rev Mr Curtin of the English Church after I had been taught to repeat the Creed and the Lord's Prayer I wished at that time to attend a Sunday School taught by Mr Curtin but he would not receive me without a written note from my master granting his permission I did not ask my owner's permission from the belief that it would be refused so that I got no farther instruction at that time from the English Church She possesses a copy of Mrs Trimmer's Charity School Spelling Book presented to her by the Rev Mr Curtin and dated August In this book her name is written Mary Princess of Wales an appellation which she says was given her by her owners It is a common practice with the colonists to give ridiculous names of this description to their slaves being in fact one of the numberless modes of expressing the habitual contempt with which they regard the negro race In printing this narrative we have retained Mary's paternal name of Prince Ed Some time after I began to attend the Moravian Church I met with Daniel James afterwards my dear husband He was a carpenter and cooper to his trade an honest hard working decent black man and a widower He had purchased his freedom of his mistress old Mrs Baker with money he had earned whilst a slave When he asked me to marry him I took time to consider the matter over with myself and would not say yes till he went to church with me and joined the Moravians He was very industrious after he bought his freedom and he had hired a comfortable house and had convenient things about him We were joined in marriage about Christmas in the Moravian Chapel at Spring Gardens by the Rev Mr Olufsen We could not be married in the English Church English marriage is not allowed to slaves and no free man can marry a slave woman When Mr Wood heard of my marriage he flew into a great rage and sent for Daniel who was helping to build a house for his old mistress Mr Wood asked him who gave him a right to marry a slave of his My husband said Sir I am a free man and thought I had a right to choose a wife but if I had known Molly was not allowed to have a husband I should not have asked her to marry me Mrs Wood was more vexed about my marriage than her husband She could not forgive Page me for getting married but stirred up Mr Wood to flog me dreadfully with the horsewhip I thought it very hard to be whipped at my time of life for getting a husband I told her so She said that she would not have nigger men about the yards and premises or allow a nigger man's clothes to be washed in the same tub where hers were washed She was fearful I think that I should lose her time in order to wash and do things for my husband but I had then no time to wash for myself I was obliged to put out my own clothes though I was always at the wash tub I had not much happiness in my marriage owing to my being a slave It made my husband sad to see me so ill treated Mrs Wood was always abusing me about him She did not lick me herself but she got her husband to do it for her whilst she fretted the flesh off my bones Yet for all this she would not sell me She sold five slaves whilst I was with her but though she was always finding fault with me she would not part with me However Mr Wood afterwards allowed Daniel to have a place to live in our yard which we were very thankful for After this I fell ill again with the rheumatism and was sick a long time but whether sick or well I had my work to do About this time I asked my master and mistress to let me buy my own freedom With the help of Mr Burchell I could have found the means to pay Mr Wood for it was agreed that I should afterwards serve Mr Burchell a while for the cash he was to advance for me I was earnest in the request to my owners but their hearts were hard too hard to consent Mrs Wood was very angry she grew quite outrageous she called me a black devil and asked me who had put freedom into my head To be free is very sweet I said but she took good care to keep me a slave I saw her change colour and I left the room About this time my master and mistress were going to England to put their son to school and bring their daughters home and they took me with them to take care of the child I was willing to come to England I thought that by going there I should probably get cured of my rheumatism and should return with my master and mistress quite well to my husband My husband was willing for me to come away for he had heard that my master would free me and I also hoped this might prove true but it was all a false report The steward of the ship was very kind to me He and my husband were in the same class in the Moravian Church I was thankful that he was so friendly for my mistress was not kind to me on the passage and she told me when she was angry that she did not intend to treat me any better in England than in the West Indies that I need not expect it And she was as good as her word When we drew near to England the rheumatism seized all my limbs worse than ever and my body was dreadfully swelled When we landed at the Tower I shewed my flesh to my mistress but she took no great notice of it We were obliged to stop at the tavern till my master got a house and a day or two after my mistress sent me down into the wash house to learn to wash in the English way In the West Indies we wash with cold water in England with hot I told my mistress I was afraid that putting my hands first into the hot water and then Page into the cold would increase the pain in my limbs The doctor had told my mistress long before I came from the West Indies that I was a sickly body and the washing did not agree with me But Mrs Wood would not release me from the tub so I was forced to do as I could I grew worse and could not stand to wash I was then forced to sit down with the tub before me and often through pain and weakness was reduced to kneel or to sit down on the floor to finish my task When I complained to my mistress of this she only got into a passion as usual and said washing in hot water could not hurt any one that I was lazy and insolent and wanted to be free of my work but that she would make me do it I thought her very hard on me and my heart rose up within me However I kept still at that time and went down again to wash the child's things but the English washerwomen who were at work there when they saw that I was so ill had pity upon me and washed them for me After that when we came up to live in Leigh Street Mrs Wood sorted out five bags of clothes which we had used at sea and also such as had been worn since we came on shore for me and the cook to wash Elizabeth the cook told her that she did not think that I was able to stand to the tub and that she had better hire a woman I also said myself that I had come over to nurse the child and that I was sorry I had come from Antigua since mistress would work me so hard without compassion for my rheumatism Mr and Mrs Wood when they heard this rose up in a passion against me They opened the door and bade me get out But I was a stranger and did not know one door in the street from another and was unwilling to go away They made a dreadful uproar and from that day they constantly kept cursing and abusing me I was obliged to wash though I was very ill Mrs Wood indeed once hired a washerwoman but she was not well treated and would come no more My master quarrelled with me another time about one of our great washings his wife having stirred him up to do so He said he would compel me to do the whole of the washing given out to me or if I again refused he would take a short course with me he would either send me down to the brig in the river to carry me back to Antigua or he would turn me at once out of doors and let me provide for myself I said I would willingly go back if he would let me purchase my own freedom But this enraged him more than all the rest he cursed and swore at me dreadfully and said he would never sell my freedom if I wished to be free I was free in England and I might go and try what freedom would do for me and be d d My heart was very sore with this treatment but I had to go on I continued to do my work and did all I could to give satisfaction but all would not do Shortly after the cook left them and then matters went on ten times worse I always washed the child's clothes without being commanded to do it and any thing else that was wanted in the family though still I was very sick very sick indeed When the great washing came round which was every two months my mistress got together again a great many heavy things such as bed ticks bed coverlets c for me to wash I told her I was too ill to wash such heavy things that day Page She said she supposed I thought myself a free woman but I was not and if I did not do it directly I should be instantly turned out of doors I stood a long time before I could answer for I did not know well what to do I knew that I was free in England but I did not know where to go or how to get my living and therefore I did not like to leave the house But Mr Wood said he would send for a constable to thrust me out and at last I took courage and resolved that I would not be longer thus treated but would go and trust to Providence This was the fourth time they had threatened to turn me out and go where I might I was determined now to take them at their word though I thought it very hard after I had lived with them for thirteen years and worked for them like a horse to be driven out in this way like a beggar My only fault was being sick and therefore unable to please my mistress who thought she never could get work enough out of her slaves and I told them so but they only abused me and drove me out This took place from two to three months I think after we came to England When I came away I went to the man one Mash who used to black the shoes of the family and asked his wife to get somebody to go with me to Hatton Garden to the Moravian Missionaries these were the only persons I knew in England The woman sent a young girl with me to the mission house and I saw there a gentleman called Mr Moore I told him my whole story and how my owners had treated me and asked him to take in my trunk with what few clothes I had The missionaries were very kind to me they were sorry for my destitute situation and gave me leave to bring my things to be placed under their care They were very good people and they told me to come to the church When I went back to Mr Wood's to get my trunk I saw a lady Mrs Pell who was on a visit to my mistress When Mr and Mrs Wood heard me come in they set this lady to stop me finding that they had gone too far with me Mrs Pell came out to me and said Are you really going to leave Molly Don't leave but come into the country with me I believe she said this because she thought Mrs Wood would easily get me back again I replied to her Ma'am this is the fourth time my master and mistress have driven me out or threatened to drive me and I will give them no more occasion to bid me go I was not willing to leave them for I am a stranger in this country but now I must go I can stay no longer to be so used Mrs Pell then went up stairs to my mistress and told that I would go and that she could not stop me Mrs Wood was very much hurt and frightened when she found I was determined to go out that day She said If she goes the people will rob her and then turn her adrift She did not say this to me but she spoke it loud enough for me to hear that it might induce me not to go I suppose Mr Wood also asked me where I was going to I told him where I had been and that I should never have gone away had I not been driven out by my owners He had given me a written paper some time before which said that I had come with them to England by my own desire and that was true It said also that I left them of my own free will because I was a free woman in England and that Page I was idle and would not do my work which was not true I gave this paper afterwards to a gentleman who inquired into my case See page I went into the kitchen and got my clothes out The nurse and the servant girl were there and I said to the man who was going to take out my trunk Stop before you take up this trunk and hear what I have to say before these people I am going out of this house as I was ordered but I have done no wrong at all to my owners neither here nor in the West Indies I always worked very hard to please them both by night and day but there was no giving satisfaction for my mistress could never be satisfied with reasonable service I told my mistress I was sick and yet she has ordered me out of doors This is the fourth time and now I am going out And so I came out and went and carried my trunk to the Moravians I then returned back to Mash the shoe black's house and begged his wife to take me in I had a little West Indian money in my trunk and they got it changed for me This helped to support me for a little while The man's wife was very kind to me I was very sick and she boiled nourishing things up for me She also sent for a doctor to see me and he sent me medicine which did me good though I was ill for a long time with the rheumatic pains I lived a good many months with these poor people and they nursed me and did all that lay in their power to serve me The man was well acquainted with my situation as he used to go to and fro to Mr Wood's house to clean shoes and knives and he and his wife were sorry for me About this time a woman of the name of Hill told me of the Anti Slavery Society and went with me to their office to inquire if they could do any thing to get me my freedom and send me back to the West Indies The gentlemen of the Society took me to a lawyer who examined very strictly into my case but told me that the laws of England could do nothing to make me free in Antigua She came first to the Anti Slavery Office in Aldermanbury about the latter end of November and her case was referred to Mr George Stephen to be investigated More of this hereafter ED However they did all they could for me they gave me a little money from time to time to keep me from want and some of them went to Mr Wood to try to persuade him to let me return a free woman to my husband but though they offered him as I have heard a large sum for my freedom he was sulky and obstinate and would not consent to let me go free This was the first winter I spent in England and I suffered much from the severe cold and from the rheumatic pains which still at times torment me However Providence was very good to me and I got many friends especially some Quaker ladies who hearing of my case came and sought me out and gave me good warm clothing and money Thus I had great cause to bless God in my affliction When I got better I was anxious to get some work to do as I was unwilling to eat the bread of idleness Mrs Mash who was a laundress recommended me to a lady for a charwoman She paid me very handsomely for what work I did and I divided the money with Mrs Page Mash for though very poor they gave me food when my own money was done and never suffered me to want In the spring I got into service with a lady who saw me at the house where I sometimes worked as a charwoman This lady's name was Mrs Forsyth She had been in the West Indies and was accustomed to Blacks and liked them I was with her six months and went with her to Margate She treated me well and gave me a good character when she left London She refers to a written certificate which will be inserted afterwards After Mrs Forsyth went away I was again out of place and went to lodgings for which I paid two shillings a week and found coals and candle After eleven weeks the money I had saved in service was all gone and I was forced to go back to the Anti Slavery office to ask a supply till I could get another situation I did not like to go back I did not like to be idle I would rather work for my living than get it for nothing They were very good to give me a supply but I felt shame at being obliged to apply for relief whilst I had strength to work At last I went into the service of Mr and Mrs Pringle where I have been ever since and am as comfortable as I can be while separated from my dear husband and away from my own country and all old friends and connections My dear mistress teaches me daily to read the word of God and takes great pains to make me understand it I enjoy the great privilege of being enabled to attend church three times on the Sunday and I have met with many kind friends since I have been here both clergymen and others The Rev Mr Young who lives in the next house has shown me much kindness and taken much pains to instruct me particularly while my master and mistress were absent in Scotland Nor must I forget among my friends the Rev Mr Mortimer the good clergyman of the parish under whose ministry I have now sat for upwards of twelve months I trust in God I have profited by what I have heard from him He never keeps back the truth and I think he has been the means of opening my eyes and ears much better to understand the word of God Mr Mortimer tells me that he cannot open the eyes of my heart but that I must pray to God to change my heart and make me to know the truth and the truth will make me free I still live in the hope that God will find a way to give me my liberty and give me back to my husband I endeavour to keep down my fretting and to leave all to Him for he knows what is good for me better than I know myself Yet I must confess I find it a hard and heavy task to do so I am often much vexed and I feel great sorrow when I hear some people in this country say that the slaves do not need better usage and do not want to be free The whole of this paragraph especially is given as nearly as was possible in Mary's precise words They believe the foreign people She means West Indians who deceive them and say slaves are happy I say Not so How can slaves be happy when they have the halter round their neck and the Page whip upon their back and are disgraced and thought no more of than beasts and are separated from their mothers and husbands and children and sisters just as cattle are sold and separated Is it happiness for a driver in the field to take down his wife or sister or child and strip them and whip them in such a disgraceful manner women that have had children exposed in the open field to shame There is no modesty or decency shown by the owner to his slaves men women and children are exposed alike Since I have been here I have often wondered how English people can go out into the West Indies and act in such a beastly manner But when they go to the West Indies they forget God and all feeling of shame I think since they can see and do such things They tie up slaves like hogs moor A West Indian phrase to fasten or tie up them up like cattle and they lick them so as hogs or cattle or horses never were flogged and yet they come home and say and make some good people believe that slaves don't want to get out of slavery But they put a cloak about the truth It is not so All slaves want to be free to be free is very sweet I will say the truth to English people who may read this history that my good friend Miss S is now writing down for me I have been a slave myself I know what slaves feel I can tell by myself what other slaves feel and by what they have told me The man that says slaves be quite happy in slavery that they don't want to be free that man is either ignorant or a lying person I never heard a slave say so I never heard a Buckra man say so till I heard tell of it in England Such people ought to be ashamed of themselves They can't do without slaves they say What's the reason they can't do without slaves as well as in England No slaves here no whips no stocks no punishment except for wicked people They hire servants in England and if they don't like them they send them away they can't lick them Let them work ever so hard in England they are far better off than slaves If they get a bad master they give warning and go hire to another They have their liberty That's just what we want We don't mind hard work if we had proper treatment and proper wages like English servants and proper time given in the week to keep us from breaking the Sabbath But they won't give it they will have work work work night and day sick or well till we are quite done up and we must not speak up nor look amiss however much we be abused And then when we are quite done up who cares for us more than for a lame horse This is slavery I tell it to let English people know the truth and I hope they will never leave off to pray God and call loud to the great King of England till all the poor blacks be given free and slavery done up for evermore Page SUPPLEMENT TO THE HISTORY OF MARY PRINCE BY THE EDITOR LEAVING Mary's narrative for the present without comment to the reader's reflections I proceed to state some circumstances connected with her case which have fallen more particularly under my own notice and which I consider it incumbent now to lay fully before the public About the latter end of November this poor woman found her way to the office of the Anti Slavery Society in Aldermanbury by the aid of a person who had become acquainted with her situation and had advised her to apply there for advice and assistance After some preliminary examination into the accuracy of the circumstances related by her I went along with her to Mr George Stephen solicitor and requested him to investigate and draw up a statement of her case and have it submitted to counsel in order to ascertain whether or not under the circumstances her freedom could be legally established on her return to Antigua On this occasion in Mr Stephen's presence and mine she expressed in very strong terms her anxiety to return thither if she could go as a free person and at the same time her extreme apprehensions of the fate that would probably await her if she returned as a slave Her words were I would rather go into my grave than go back a slave to Antigua though I wish to go back to my husband very much very much very much I am much afraid my owners would separate me from my husband and use me very hard or perhaps sell me for a field negro and slavery is too too bad I would rather go into my grave The paper which Mr Wood had given her before she left his house was placed by her in Mr Stephen's hands It was expressed in the following terms I have already told Molly and now give it her in writing in order that there may be no misunderstanding on her part that as I brought her from Antigua at her own request and entreaty and that she is consequently now free she is of course at liberty to take her baggage and go where she pleases And in consequence of her late conduct she must do one of two things either quit the house or return to Antigua by the earliest opportunity as she does not evince a disposition to make herself useful As she is a stranger in London I do not wish to turn Page her out or would do so as two female servants are sufficient for my establishment If after this she does remain it will be only during her good behaviour but on no consideration will I allow her wages or any other remuneration for her services JOHN A WOOD London August This paper though not devoid of inconsistencies which will be apparent to any attentive reader is craftily expressed and was well devised to serve the purpose which the writer had obviously in view namely to frustrate any appeal which the friendless black woman might make to the sympathy of strangers and thus prevent her from obtaining an asylum if she left his house from any respectable family As she had no one to refer to for a character in this country except himself he doubtless calculated securely on her being speedily driven back as soon as the slender fund she had in her possession was expended to throw herself unconditionally upon his tender mercies and his disappointment in this expectation appears to have exasperated his feelings of resentment towards the poor woman to a degree which few persons alive to the claims of common justice not to speak of christianity or common humanity could easily have anticipated Such at least seems the only intelligible inference that can be drawn from his subsequent conduct The case having been submitted by desire of the Anti Slavery Committee to the consideration of Dr Lushington and Mr Sergeant Stephen it was found that there existed no legal means of compelling Mary's master to grant her manumission and that if she returned to Antigua she would inevitably fall again under his power or that of his attorneys as a slave It was however resolved to try what could be effected for her by amicable negotiation and with this view Mr Ravenscroft a solicitor Mr G Stephen's relative called upon Mr Wood in order to ascertain whether he would consent to Mary's manumission on any reasonable terms and to refer if required the amount of compensation for her value to arbitration Mr Ravenscroft with some difficulty obtained one or two interviews but found Mr Wood so full of animosity against the woman and so firmly bent against any arrangement having her freedom for its object that the negotiation was soon broken off as hopeless The angry slave owner declared that he would not move a finger about her in this country or grant her manumission on any terms whatever and that if she went back to the West Indies she must take the consequences This unreasonable conduct of Mr Wood induced the Anti Slavery Committee after several other abortive attempts to effect a compromise to think of bringing the case under the notice of Parliament The heads of Mary's statement were accordingly engrossed in a Petition which Dr Lushington offered to present and to give notice at the same time of his intention to bring in a Bill to provide for the entire emancipation of all slaves brought to England with the owner's consent But before this step was taken Dr Lushington again had recourse to negociation with the master and partly through the friendly intervention of Mr Manning partly by personal conference used every persuasion in his power to induce Mr Wood to relent and let the bondwoman go free Page Seeing the matter thus seriously taken up Mr Wood became at length alarmed not relishing it appears the idea of having the case publicly discussed in the House of Commons and to avert this result he submitted to temporize assumed a demeanour of unwonted civility and even hinted to Mr Manning as I was given to understand that if he was not driven to utter hostility by the threatened exposure he would probably meet our wishes in his own time and way Having gained time by these manoeuvres he adroitly endeavoured to cool the ardour of Mary's new friends in her cause by representing her as an abandoned and worthless woman ungrateful towards him and undeserving of sympathy from others allegations which he supported by the ready affirmation of some of his West India friends and by one or two plausible letters procured from Antigua By these and like artifices he appears completely to have imposed on Mr Manning the respectable West India merchant whom Dr Lushington had asked to negotiate with him and he prevailed so far as to induce Dr Lushington himself actuated by the benevolent view of thereby best serving Mary's cause to abstain from any remarks upon his conduct when the petition was at last presented in Parliament In this way he dextrously contrived to neutralize all our efforts until the close of the Session of soon after which he embarked with his family for the West Indies Every exertion for Mary's relief having thus failed and being fully convinced from a twelvemonth's observation of her conduct that she was really a well disposed and respectable woman I engaged her in December as a domestic servant in my own family In this capacity she has remained ever since and I am thus enabled to speak of her conduct and character with a degree of confidence I could not have otherwise done The importance of this circumstance will appear in the sequel From the time of Mr Wood's departure to Antigua in till June or July last no farther effort was attempted for Mary's relief Some faint hope was still cherished that this unconscionable man would at length relent and in his own time and way grant the prayer of the exiled negro woman After waiting however nearly twelvemonths longer and seeing the poor woman's spirits daily sinking under the sickening influence of hope deferred I resolved on a final attempt in her behalf through the intervention of the Moravian Missionaries and of the Governor of Antigua At my request Mr Edward Moore agent of the Moravian Brethren in London wrote to the Rev Joseph Newby their Missionary in that island empowering him to negotiate in his own name with Mr Wood for Mary's manumission and to procure his consent if possible upon terms of ample pecuniary compensation At the same time the excellent and benevolent William Allen of the Society of Friends wrote to Sir Patrick Ross the Governor of the Colony with whom he was on terms of friendship soliciting him to use his influence in persuading Mr Wood to consent and I confess I was sanguine enough to flatter myself that we should thus at length prevail The result proved however that I had not yet fully appreciated the character of the man we had to deal with Mr Newby's answer arrived early in November last mentioning that Page he had done all in his power to accomplish our purpose but in vain and that if Mary's manumission could not be obtained without Mr Wood's consent he believed there was no prospect of its ever being effected A few weeks afterwards I was informed by Mr Allen that he had received a letter from Sir Patrick Ross stating that he also had used his best endeavours in the affair but equally without effect Sir Patrick at the same time inclosed a letter addressed by Mr Wood to his Secretary Mr Taylor assigning his reasons for persisting in this extraordinary course This letter requires our special attention Its tenor is as follows My dear Sir In reply to your note relative to the woman Molly I beg you will have the kindness to oblige me by assuring his Excellency that I regret exceedingly my inability to comply with his request which under other circumstances would afford me very great pleasure There are many and powerful reasons for inducing me to refuse my sanction to her returning here in the way she seems to wish It would be to reward the worst species of ingratitude and subject myself to insult whenever she came in my way Her moral character is very bad as the police records will shew and she would be a very troublesome character should she come here without any restraint She is not a native of this country and I know of no relation she has here I induced her to take a husband a short time before she left this by providing a comfortable house in my yard for them and prohibiting her going out after to o'clock our bed time without special leave This she considered the greatest and indeed the only grievance she ever complained of and all my efforts could not prevent it In hopes of inducing her to be steady to her husband who was a free man I gave him the house to occupy during our absence but it appears the attachment was too loose to bind her and he has taken another wife so on that score I do her no injury In England she made her election and quitted my family This I had no right to object to and I should have thought no more of it but not satisfied to leave quietly she gave every trouble and annoyance in her power and endeavoured to injure the character of my family by the most vile and infamous falsehoods which was embodied in a petition to the House of Commons and would have been presented had not my friends from this island particularly the Hon Mr Byam and Dr Coull come forward and disproved what she had asserted It would be beyond the limits of an ordinary letter to detail her baseness though I will do so should his Excellency wish it but you may judge of her depravity by one circumstance which came out before Mr Justice Dyett in a quarrel with another female Such a thing I could not have believed possible I omit the circumstance here mentioned because it is too indecent to appear in a publication likely to be perused by females It is in all probability a vile calumny but even if it were perfectly true it would not serve Mr Wood's case one straw Any reader who wishes it may see the passage referred to in the autograph letter in my possession T P Losing her value as a slave in a pecuniary point of view I consider of no consequence for it was our intention had she conducted herself properly and returned with us to have given her freedom She has taken her freedom and all I wish is that she would enjoy it without meddling with me Let me again repeat if his Excellency wishes it it will afford me great pleasure Page to state such particulars of her and which will be incontestably proved by numbers here that I am sure will acquit me in his opinion of acting unkind or ungenerous towards her I'll say nothing of the liability I should incur under the Consolidated Slave Law of dealing with a free person as a slave My only excuse for entering so much into detail must be that of my anxious wish to stand justified in his Excellency's opinion I am my dear Sir Yours very truly JOHN A WOOD th Oct Charles Taylor Esq c c c I forgot to mention that it was at her own special request that she accompanied me to England and also that she had a considerable sum of money with her which she had saved in my service I knew of to at least for I had some trouble to recover it from a white man to whom she had lent it J A W Such is Mr Wood's justification of his conduct in thus obstinately refusing manumission to the Negro woman who had escaped from his house of bondage Let us now endeavour to estimate the validity of the excuses assigned and the allegations advanced by him for the information of Governor Sir Patrick Ross in this deliberate statement of his case To allow the woman to return home free would he affirms be to reward the worst species of ingratitude He assumes it seems the sovereign power of pronouncing a virtual sentence of banishment for the alleged crime of ingratitude Is this then a power which any man ought to possess over his fellow mortal or which any goodman would ever wish to exercise And besides there is no evidence whatever beyond Mr Wood's mere assertion that Mary Prince owed him or his family the slightest mark of gratitude Her account of the treatment she received in his service may be incorrect but her simple statement is at least supported by minute and feasible details and unless rebutted by positive facts will certainly command credence from impartial minds more readily than his angry accusation which has something absurd and improbable in its very front Moreover is it not absurd to term the assertion of her natural rights by a slave even supposing her to have been kindly dealt with by her owners and treated in every respect the reverse of what Mary affirms to have been her treatment by Mr Wood and his wife the worst species of ingratitude This may be West Indian ethics but it will scarcely be received as sound doctrine in Europe To permit her return would be to subject himself to insult whenever she came in his way This is a most extraordinary assertion Are the laws of Antigua then so favourable to the free blacks or the colonial police so feebly administered that there are no sufficient restraints to protect a rich colonist like Mr Wood a man who counts among his familiar friends the Honourable Mr Byam and Mr Taylor the Government Secretary from being insulted by a poor Negro woman It is preposterous Her moral character is so bad that she would prove very trouble some should she come to the colony without any restraint Page Any restraint Are there no restraints supposing them necessary short of absolute slavery to keep troublesome characters in order But this I suppose is the argumentum ad gubernatorem to frighten the governor She is such a termagant it seems that if she once gets back to the colony free she will not only make it too hot for poor Mr Wood but the police and courts of justice will scarce be a match for her Sir Patrick Ross no doubt will take care how he intercedes farther for so formidable a virago How can one treat such arguments seriously She is not a native of the colony and he knows of no relation she has there True But was it not her home so far as a slave can have a home for thirteen or fourteen years Were not the connexions friendships and associations of her mature life formed there Was it not there she hoped to spend her latter years in domestic tranquillity with her husband free from the lash of the taskmaster These consideratious may appear light to Mr Wood but they are every thing to this poor woman He induced her he says to take a husband a short time before she left Antigua and gave them a comfortable house in his yard c c This paragraph merits attention He induced her to take a husband If the fact were true what brutality of mind and manners does it not indicate among these slave holders They refuse to legalize the marriages of their slaves but induce them to form such temporary connexions as may suit the owner's conveniency just as they would pair the lower animals and this man has the effrontery to tell us so Mary however tells a very different story see page and her assertion independently of other proof is at least as credible as Mr Wood's The reader will judge for himself as to the preponderance of internal evidence in the conflicting statements He alleges that she was before marriage licentious and even depraved in her conduct and unfaithful to her husband afterwards These are serious charges But if true or even partially true how comes it that a person so correct in his family hours and arrangements as Mr Wood professes to be and who expresses so edifying a horror of licentiousness could reconcile it to his conscience to keep in the bosom of his family so depraved as well as so troublesome a character for at least thirteen years and confide to her for long periods too the charge of his house and the care of his children for such I shall shew to have been the facts How can he account for not having rid himself with all speed of so disreputable an inmate he who values her loss so little in a pecuniary point of view How can he account for having sold five other slaves in that period and yet have retained this shocking woman nay even have refused to sell her on more than one occasion when offered her full value It could not be from ignorance of her character for the circumstance which he adduces as a proof of her shameless depravity and which I have omitted on account of its indecency occurred it would appear not less than ten years ago Yet not with standing her alleged ill qualities and habits of gross immorality he has not only constantly refused to part with her but after thirteen long years brings her to England as an attendant on his wife and children with the avowed intention of carrying her back along with his maiden daughter a young Page lady returning from school Such are the extraordinary facts and until Mr Wood shall reconcile these singular inconsistencies between his actions and his allegations he must not be surprised if we in England prefer giving credit to the former rather than the latter although at present it appears somewhat difficult to say which side of the alternative is the more creditable to his own character Her husband he says has taken another wife so that on that score he adds he does her no injury Supposing this fact be true which I doubt as I doubt every mere assertion from so questionable a quarter I shall take leave to put a question or two to Mr Wood's conscience Did he not write from England to his friend Mr Darrel soon after Mary left his house directing him to turn her husband Daniel James off his premises on account of her offence telling him to inform James at the same time that his wife had taken up with another man who had robbed her of all she had a calumny as groundless as it was cruel I further ask if the person who invented this story whoever he may be was not likely enough to impose similar fabrications on the poor negro man's credulity until be may have been induced to prove false to his marriage vows and to take another wife as Mr Wood coolly expresses it But withal I strongly doubt the fact of Daniel James' infidelity for there is now before me a letter from himself to Mary dated in April couched in strong terms of conjugal affection expressing his anxiety for her speedy return and stating that he had lately received a grace a token of religious advancement in the Moravian church a circumstance altogether incredible if the man were living in open adultery as Mr Wood's assertion implies Mary he says endeavoured to injure the character of his family by infamous falsehoods which were embodied in a petition to the House of Commons and would have been presented had not his friends from Antigua the Hon Mr Byam and Dr Coull disproved her assertions I can say something on this point from my own knowledge Mary's petition contained simply a brief statement of her case and among other things mentioned the treatment she had received from Mr and Mrs Wood Now the principal facts are corroborated by other evidence and Mr Wood must bring forward very different testimony from that of Dr Coull before well informed persons will give credit to his contradiction The value of that person's evidence in such cases will be noticed presently Of the Hon Mr Byam I know nothing and shall only at present remark that it is not likely to redound greatly to his credit to appear in such company Furthermore Mary's petition was presented as Mr Wood ought to know though it was not discussed nor his conduct exposed as it ought to have been He speaks of the liability he should incur under the Consolidated Slave Law of dealing with a free person as a slave Is not this pretext hypocritical in the extreme What liability could he possibly incur by voluntarily resigning the power conferred on him by an iniquitous colonial law of re imposing the shackles of slavery on the bondwoman from whose limbs they had fallen when she touched the free soil of England There exists no liability from which he might not have been easily secured or for which he would not have been fully compensated Page He adds in a postscript that Mary had a considerable sum of money with her from to at least which she had saved in his service The fact is that she had at one time dollars in cash but only a very small portion of that sum appears to have been brought by her to England the rest having been partly advanced as she states to assist her husband and partly lost by being lodged in unfaithful custody Finally Mr Wood repeats twice that it will afford him great pleasure to state for the governor's satisfaction if required such particulars of the woman Molly upon incontestable evidence as he is sure will acquit him in his Excellency's opinion of acting unkind or ungenerous towards her This is well and I now call upon Mr Wood to redeem his pledge to bring forward facts and proofs fully to elucidate the subject to reconcile if he can the extraordinary discrepancies which I have pointed out between his assertions and the actual facts and especially between his account of Mary Prince's character and his own conduct in regard to her He has now to produce such a statement as will acquit him not only in the opinion of Sir Patrick Ross but of the British public And in this position he has spontaneously placed himself in attempting to destroy by his deliberate criminatory letter the poor woman's fair fame and reputation an attempt but for which the present publication would probably never have appeared Here perhaps we might safely leave the case to the judgment of the public but as this negro woman's character not the less valuable to her because her condition is so humble has been so unscrupulously blackened by her late master a party so much interested and inclined to place her in the worst point of view it is incumbent on me as her advocate with the public to state such additional testimony in her behalf as I can fairly and conscientiously adduce My first evidence is Mr Joseph Phillips of Antigua Having submitted to his inspection Mr Wood's letter and Mary Prince's narrative and requested his candid and deliberate sentiments in regard to the actual facts of the case I have been favoured with the following letter from him on the subject London January Dear Sir In giving you my opinion of Mary Prince's narrative and of Mr Wood's letter respecting her addressed to Mr Taylor I shall first mention my opportunities of forming a proper estimate of the conduct and character of both parties I have known Mr Wood since his first arrival in Antigua in He was then a poor young man who had been brought up as a ship carpenter in Bermuda He was afterwards raised to be a clerk in the Commissariat department and realised sufficient capital to commence business as a merchant This last profession he has followed successfully for a good many years and is understood to have accumulated very considerable wealth After he entered into trade I had constant intercourse with him in the way of business and in and I was regularly employed on his premises as his clerk consequently I had opportunities of seeing a good deal of his character both as a merchant and as a master of slaves The former topic I pass over as irrelevant to the present subject in reference to the latter I shall merely observe that he was not in regard to ordinary Page matters more severe probably than the ordinary run of slave owners but if seriously offended he was not of a disposition to be easily appeased and was obstinate in adhering to any resolution he had once taken As regards the exaction of work from domestic slaves his wife was probably more severe than himself it was almost impossible for the slaves ever to give her entire satisfaction Of their slave Molly or Mary I know less than of Mr and Mrs Wood but I saw and heard enough of her both while I was constantly employed on Mr Wood's premises and while I was there occasionally on business to be quite certain that she was viewed by her owners as their most respectable and trust worthy female slave It is within my personal knowledge that she had usually the charge of the house in their absence was entrusted with the keys c and was always considered by the neighbours and visitors as their confidential household servant and as a person in whose integrity they placed unlimited confidence although when Mrs Wood was at home she was no doubt kept pretty closely at washing and other hard work A decided proof of the estimation in which she was held by her owners exists in the fact that Mr Wood uniformly refused to part with her whereas he sold five other slaves while she was with them Indeed she always appeared to me to be a slave of superior intelligence and respectability and I always understood such to be her general character in the place As to what Mr Wood alleges about her being frequently before the police c I can only say I never heard of the circumstance before and as I lived for twenty years in the same small town and in the vicinity of their residence I think I could scarcely have failed to become acquainted with it had such been the fact She might however have been occasionally before the magistrate in consequence of little disputes among the slaves without any serious imputation on her general respectability She says she was twice summoned to appear as a witness on such occasions and that she was once sent by her mistress to be confined in the Cage and was afterwards flogged by her desire This cruel practice is very common in Antigua and in my opinion is but little creditable to the slave owners and magistrates by whom such arbitrary punishments are inflicted frequently for very trifling faults Mr James Scotland is the only magistrate in the colony who invariably refuses to sanction this reprehensible practice Of the immoral conduct ascribed to Molly by Mr Wood I can say nothing further than this that I have heard she had at a former period previous to her marriage a connexion with a white person a Capt which I have no doubt was broken off when she became seriously impressed with religion But at any rate such connexions are so common I might almost say universal in our slave colonies that except by the missionaries and a few serious persons they are considered if faults at all so very venial as scarcely to deserve the name of immorality Mr Wood knows this colonial estimate of such connexions as well as I do and however false such an estimate must be allowed to be especially when applied to their own conduct by persons of education pretending to adhere to the pure Christian rule of morals yet when he ascribes to a negro slave to whom legal marriage was denied such great criminality for laxity of this sort and professes to be so exceedingly shocked and amazed at the tale he himself relates he must I am confident have had a farther object in view than the information of Mr Taylor or Sir Patrick Ross He must it is evident have been aware that his letter would be sent to Mr Allen and accordingly adapted it as more important documents from the colonies are often adapted for effect in England The tale of the slave Molly's immoralities be assured was not intended for Antigua so much as for Stoke Newington and Peckham and Aldermanbury In regard to Mary's narrative generally although I cannot speak to the accuracy of the details except in a few recent particulars I can with safety declare that I see no reason to question the truth of a single fact stated by her or even to suspect her in any instance of intentional exaggeration It bears in my judgment Page the genuine stamp of truth and nature Such is my unhesitating opinion after a residence of twenty seven years in the West Indies To T Pringle Esq I remain c JOSEPH PHILLIPS P S As Mr Wood refers to the evidence of Dr T Coull in opposition to Mary's assertions it may be proper to enable you justly to estimate the worth of that person's evidence in cases connected with the condition and treatment of slaves You are aware that in Mr M'Queen of Glasgow in noticing a Report of the Ladies' Society of Birmingham for the relief of British Negro Slaves asserted with his characteristic audacity that the statement which it contained respecting distressed and deserted slaves in Antigua was an abominable falsehood Not contented with this and with insinuating that I as agent of the society in the distribution of their charity in Antigua had fraudulently duped them out of their money by a fabricated tale of distress Mr M'Queen proceeded to libel me in the most opprobrious terms as a man of the most worthless and abandoned character In elucidation of the circumstances above referred to I subjoin the following extracts from the Report of the Birmingham Ladies' Society for As a portion of the funds of this association has been appropriated to assist the benevolent efforts of a society which has for fifteen years afforded relief to distressed and deserted slaves in Antigua it may not be uninteresting to our friends to learn the manner in which the agent of this society has been treated for simply obeying the command of our Saviour by ministering like the good Samaritan to the distresses of the helpless and the desolate The society's proceedings being adverted to by a friend of Africa at one of the public meetings held in this country a West Indian planter who was present wrote over to his friends in Antigua and represented the conduct of the distributors of this charity in such a light that it was deemed worthy of the cognizance of the House of Assembly Mr Joseph Phillips a resident of the island who had most kindly and disinterestedly exerted himself in the distribution of the money from England among the poor deserted slaves was brought before the Assembly and most severely interrogated on his refusing to deliver up his private correspondence with his friends in England he was thrown into a loathsome jail where he was kept for nearly five months while his loss of business and the oppressive proceedings instituted against him were involving him in poverty and ruin On his discharge by the House of Assembly he was seized in their lobby for debt and again imprisoned In our report for the year we quoted a passage from the th Report of the Society for the relief of deserted Slaves in the island of Antigua in reference to a case of great distress This statement fell into the hands of Mr M'Queen the Editor of the Glasgow Courier Of the consequences resulting from this circumstance we only gained information through the Leicester Chronicle which had copied an article from the Weekly Register of Antigua dated St John's September We find from this that Mr M'Queen affirms that 'with the exception of the fact that the society is as it deserves to be duped out of its money the whole tale' of the distress above referred to 'is an abominable falsehood ' This statement which we are informed has appeared in many of the public papers is COMPLETELY REFUTED in our Appendix No to which we refer our readers Mr M'Queen's statements we regret to say would lead many to believe that there are no deserted Negroes to assist and that the case mentioned was a perfect fabrication He also distinctly avers that the disinterested and humane agent of the society Mr Joseph Phillips is 'a man of the most worthless and abandoned character ' In opposition to this statement we learn the good character of Mr Phillips from those who have long been acquainted with his laudable exertions in the cause of humanity and from the Editor of the Weekly Register of Antigua who speaks on his own knowledge of more than twenty years back confidently appealing at the same time to the inhabitants of the colony in which he resides for the truth of his averments and producing a testimonial to Mr Phillips's good character signed by two members of the Antigua House of Assembly and by Mr Wyke the collector of his Majesty's customs and by Antigua merchants as follows 'that they have been acquainted with him the last four years and upwards and he has always conducted himself in an upright becoming manner his character we know to be unimpeached and his morals unexceptionable ' Signed Thomas Saunderson John D Taylor John A Wood George Wyke Samuel L Darrel Giles S Musson Robert Grant St John's Antigua June In addition to the above testimonies Mr Phillips has brought over to England with him others of a more recent date from some of the most respectable persons in Antigua sufficient to cover with confusion all his unprincipled calumniators See also his account of his own case in the Anti Slavery Reporter No p Now I know from good authority that Page it was upon Dr Coull's information that Mr M'Queen founded this impudent contradiction of notorious facts and this audacious libel of my personal character From this single circumstance you may judge of the value of his evidence in the case of Mary Prince I can furnish further information respecting Dr Coull's colonial proceedings both private and judicial should circumstances require it J P I leave the preceding letter to be candidly weighed by the reader in opposition to the inculpatory allegations of Mr Wood merely remarking that Mr Wood will find it somewhat difficult to impugn the evidence of Mr Phillips whose upright unimpeached and unexceptionable character he has himself vouched for in unqualified terms by affixing his signature to the testimonial published in the Weekly Register of Antigua in See Note below The next testimony in Mary's behalf is that of Mrs Forsyth a lady in whose service she spent the summer of See page This lady on leaving London to join her husband voluntarily presented Mary with a certificate which though it relates only to a recent and short period of her history is a strong corroboration of the habitual respectability of her character It is in the following terms Mrs Forsyth states that the bearer of this paper Mary James has been with her for the last six months that she has found her an excellent character being honest industrious and sober and that she parts with her on no other account than this that being obliged to travel with her husband who has lately come from abroad in bad health she has no farther need of a servant Any person wishing to engage her can have her character in full from Miss Robson Keppel Street Russel Square whom Mrs Forsyth has requested to furnish particulars to any one desiring them Keppel Street th Sept In the last place I add my own testimony in behalf of this negro woman Independently of the scrutiny which as Secretary of the Anti Slavery Society I made into her case when she first applied for assistance at Aldermanbury and the watchful eye I kept upon her conduct for the ensuing twelvemonths while she was the occasional pensioner of the Society I have now had the opportunity of closely observing her conduct for fourteen months in the situation of a domestic Page servant in my own family and the following is the deliberate opinion of Mary's character formed not only by myself but also by my wife and sister in law after this ample period of observation We have found her perfectly honest and trustworthy in all respects so that we have no hesitation in leaving every thing in the house at her disposal She had the entire charge of the house during our absence in Scotland for three months last autumn and conducted herself in that charge with the utmost discretion and fidelity She is not it is true a very expert housemaid nor capable of much hard work for her constitution appears to be a good deal broken but she is careful industrious and anxious to do her duty and to give satisfaction She is capable of strong attachments and feels deep though unobtrusive gratitude for real kindness shown her She possesses considerable natural sense and has much quickness of observation and discrimination of character She is remarkable for decency and propriety of conduct and her delicacy even in trifling minuti has been a trait of special remark by the females of my family This trait which is obviously quite unaffected would be a most inexplicable anomaly if her former habits had been so indecent and depraved as Mr Wood alleges Her chief faults so far as we have discovered them are a somewhat violent and hasty temper and a considerable share of natural pride and self importance but these defects have been but rarely and transiently manifested and have scarcely occasioned an hour's uneasiness at any time in our household Her religious knowledge notwithstanding the pious care of her Moravian instructors in Antigua is still but very limited and her views of christianity indistinct but her profession whatever it may have of imperfection I am convinced has nothing of insincerity In short we consider her on the whole as respectable and well behaved a person in her station as any domestic white or black and we have had ample experience of both colours that we have ever had in our service But after all Mary's character important though its exculpation be to her is not really the point of chief practical interest in this case Suppose all Mr Wood's defamatory allegations to be true suppose him to be able to rake up against her out of the records of the Antigua police or from the veracious testimony of his brother colonists twenty stories as bad or worse than what he insinuates suppose the whole of her own statement to be false and even the whole of her conduct since she came under our observation here to be a tissue of hypocrisy suppose all this and leave the negro woman as black in character as in complexion If it even were so how strong a plea of palliation might not the poor negro bring by adducing the neglect of her various owners to afford religious instruction or moral discipline and the habitual influence of their evil example to say the very least before her eyes What moral good could she possibly learn what moral evil could she easily escape while under the uncontrolled power of such masters as she describes Captain I and Mr D of Turk's Island All things considered it is indeed wonderful to find her such as she now is But as she has herself piously expressed it that God whom then she knew not mercifully preserved her for better things yet it would affect not the main facts which are these I Mr Wood not daring in England to punish this woman arbitrarily as he would have done in the West Indies drove her out of his house or Page left her at least only the alternative of returning instantly to Antigua with the certainty of severe treatment there or submitting in silence to what she considered intolerable usage in his household He has since obstinately persisted in refusing her manumission to enable her to return home in security though repeatedly offered more than ample compensation for her value as a slave and this on various frivolous pretexts but really and indeed not unavowedly in order to punish her for leaving his service in England though he himself had professed to give her that option These unquestionable facts speak volumes After the preceding pages were printed I was favoured with a communication from the Rev J Curtin to whom among other acquaintances of Mr Wood's in this country the entire proof sheets of this pamphlet had been sent for inspection Mr Curtin in reference to Mary Prince's narrative as it regards himself see page states That sometime before her baptism on her being admitted a catechumen preparatory to that holy ordinance she brought a note from her owner Mr Wood recommending her for religious instruction c That it was his usual practice when any adult slaves came on week days to school to require their owners' permission for their attendance but that on Sundays the chapel was open indiscriminately to all Mary however after a personal interview with Mr Curtin and after hearing his letter read by me still maintains that Mr Wood's note recommended her for baptism merely and that she never received any religious instruction whatever from Mr and Mrs Wood or from any one else at that period beyond what she has stated in her narrative In regard to her non admission to the Sunday school without permission from her owners she admits that she may possibly have mistaken the clergyman's meaning on that point but says that such was certainly her impression at the time and the actual cause of her non attendance Mr Curtin finds in his books some reference to Mary's connection with a Captain the individual I believe alluded to by Mr Phillips at page but he states that when she attended his chapel she was always decently and becomingly dressed and appeared to him to be in a situation of trust in her mistress's family Mr Curtin offers no comment on any other part of Mary's statement but he speaks in very favourable though general terms of the respectability of Mr Wood whom he had known for many years in Antigua and of Mrs Wood though she was not personally known to him he says that he had heard her spoken of by those of her acquaintance as a lady of very mild and amiable manners Another friend of Mr and Mrs Wood a lady who had been their guest both in Antigua and England alleges that Mary has grossly misrepresented them in her narrative and says that she can vouch for their being the most benevolent kind hearted people that can possibly live She has declined however to furnish me with any written correction of the misrepresentations she complains of although I offered to insert her testimony in behalf of her friends if sent to me in time And having already kept back the publication a fortnight waiting for communications of this sort I will not delay it longer Those who have withheld their strictures have only themselves to blame Of the general character of Mr and Mrs Wood I would not designedly give any unfair impression Without implicitly adopting either the view of Mary Prince or the unmeasured encomiums of their West India partizans I am willing to believe them to be on the whole fair specimens of colonial character Let them even be rated if their friends will have it so in the most respectable class of slaveholders and laying every thing else entirely out of view let Mr Wood's conduct in this affair be tried exclusively by the facts established beyond dispute and by his own statement of the case in his letter to Mr Taylor But then I ask if the very best and mildest of your slave owners can act as Mr Wood is proved to have acted what is to be expected of persons whose mildness or equity or common humanity no one will dare to vouch for If such things are done in the green tree what will be done in the dry And what else then can Colonial Slavery possibly be even in its best estate but a system incurably evil and iniquitous I require no other data I need add no further comment Page The case affords a most instructive illustration of the true spirit of the slave system and of the pretensions of the slaveholders to assert not merely their claims to a vested right in the labour of their bondmen but to an indefeasible property in them as their absolute chattels It furnishes a striking practical comment on the assertions of the West Indians that self interest is a sufficient check to the indulgence of vindictive feelings in the master for here is a case where a man a respectable and benevolent man as his friends aver prefers losing entirely the full price of the slave for the mere satisfaction of preventing a poor black woman from returning home to her husband If the pleasure of thwarting the benevolent wishes of the Anti Slavery Society in behalf of the deserted negro be an additional motive with Mr Wood it will not much mend his wretched plea I may here add a few words respecting the earlier portion of Mary Prince's narrative The facts there stated must necessarily rest entirely since we have no collateral evidence upon their intrinsic claims to probability and upon the reliance the reader may feel disposed after perusing the foregoing pages to place on her veracity To my judgment the internal evidence of the truth of her narrative appears remarkably strong The circumstances are related in a tone of natural sincerity and are accompanied in almost every case with characteristic and minute details which must I conceive carry with them full conviction to every candid mind that this negro woman has actually seen felt and suffered all that she so impressively describes and that the picture she has given of West Indian slavery is not less true than it is revolting But there may be some persons into whose hands this tract may fall so imperfectly acquainted with the real character of Negro Slavery as to be shocked into partial if not absolute incredulity by the acts of inhuman oppression and brutality related of Capt I and his wife and of Mr D the salt manufacturer of Turk's Island Here at least such persons may be disposed to think there surely must be some exaggeration the facts are too shocking to be credible The facts are indeed shocking but unhappily not the less credible on that account Slavery is a curse to the oppressor scarcely less than to the oppressed its natural tendency is to brutalize both After a residence myself of six years in a slave colony I am inclined to doubt whether as regards its demoralizing influence the master is not even a greater object of compassion than his bondman Let those who are disposed to doubt the atrocities related in this narrative on the testimony of a sufferer examine the details of many cases of similar barbarity that have lately come before the public on unquestionable evidence Passing over the reports of the Fiscal of Berbice See Anti Slavery Reporter Nos and and the Mauritius horrors recently unveiled Ibid No let them consider the case of Mr and Mrs Moss of the Bahamas and their slave Kate so justly denounced by the Secretary for the Colonies Ibid No the cases of Eleanor Mead Ibid No p No p of Henry Williams Ibid No p No p and No and Page of the Rev Mr Bridges and Kitty Hylton Anti Slavery Reporter Nos and in Jamaica These cases alone might suffice to demonstrate the inevitable tendency of slavery as it exists in our colonies to brutalize the master to a truly frightful degree a degree which would often cast into the shade even the atrocities related in the narrative of Mary Prince and which are sufficient to prove independently of all other evidence that there is nothing in the revolting character of the facts to affect their credibility but that on the contrary similar deeds are at this very time of frequent occurrence in almost every one of our slave colonies The system of coercive labour may vary in different places it may be more destructive to human life in the cane culture of Mauritius and Jamaica than in the predial and domestic bondage of Bermuda or the Bahamas but the spirit and character of slavery are every where the same and cannot fail to produce similar effects Wherever slavery prevails there will inevitably be found cruelty and oppression Individuals who have preserved humane and amiable and tolerant dispositions towards their black dependents may doubtless be found among slave holders but even where a happy instance of this sort occurs such as Mary's first mistress the kind hearted Mrs Williams the favoured condition of the slave is still as precarious as it is rare it is every moment at the mercy of events and must always be held by a tenure so proverbially uncertain as that of human prosperity or human life Such examples like a feeble and flickering streak of light in a gloomy picture only serve by contrast to exhibit the depth of the prevailing shades Like other exceptions they only prove the general rule the unquestionable tendency of the system is to vitiate the best tempers and to harden the most feeling hearts Never be kind nor speak kindly to a slave said an accomplished English lady in South Africa to my wife I have now she added been for some time a slave owner and have found from vexatious experience in my own household that nothing but harshness and hauteur will do with slaves I might perhaps not inappropriately illustrate this point more fully by stating many cases which fell under my own personal observation or became known to me through authentic sources at the Cape of Good Hope a colony where slavery assumes as it is averred a milder aspect than in any other dependency of the empire where it exists and I could shew from the judicial records of that colony received by me within these few weeks cases scarcely inferior in barbarity to the worst of those to which I have just specially referred but to do so would lead me too far from the immediate purpose of this pamphlet and extend it to an inconvenient length I shall therefore content myself with quoting a single short passage from the excellent work of my friend Dr Walsh entitled Notices of Brazil a work which besides its other merits has vividly illustrated the true spirit of Negro Slavery as it displays itself not merely in that country but wherever it has been permitted to open its Pandora's box of misery and crime Let the reader ponder on the following just remarks and compare the facts stated by the Author in illustration of them with the circumstances related at pages and of Mary's narrative Page If then we put out of the question the injury inflicted on others and merely consider the deterioration of feeling and principle with which it operates on ourselves ought it not to be a sufficient and indeed unanswerable argument against the permission of Slavery The exemplary manner in which the paternal duties are performed at home may mark people as the most fond and affectionate parents but let them once go abroad and come within the contagion of slavery and it seems to alter the very nature of a man and the father has sold and still sells the mother and his children with as little compunction as he would a sow and her litter of pigs and he often disposes of them together This deterioration of feeling is conspicuous in many ways among the Brazilians They are naturally a people of a humane and good natured disposition and much indisposed to cruelty or severity of any kind Indeed the manner in which many of them treat their slaves is a proof of this as it is really gentle and considerate but the natural tendency to cruelty and oppression in the human heart is continually evolved by the impunity and uncontrolled licence in which they are exercised I never walked through the streets of Rio that some house did not present to me the semblance of a bridewell where the moans and the cries of the sufferers and the sounds of whips and scourges within announced to me that corporal punishment was being inflicted Whenever I remarked this to a friend I was always answered that the refractory nature of the slave rendered it necessary and no house could properly be conducted unless it was practised But this is certainly not the case and the chastisement is constantly applied in the very wantonness of barbarity and would not and dared not be inflicted on the humblest wretch in society if he was not a slave and so put out of the pale of pity Immediately joining our house was one occupied by a mechanic from which the most dismal cries and moans constantly proceeded I entered the shop one day and found it was occupied by a saddler who had two negro boys working at his business He was a tawny cadaverous looking man with a dark aspect and he had cut from his leather a scourge like a Russian knout which he held in his hand and was in the act of exercising on one of the naked children in an inner room and this was the cause of the moans and cries we heard every day and almost all day long In the rear of our house was another occupied by some women of bad character who kept as usual several negro slaves I was awoke early one morning by dismal cries and looking out of the window I saw in the back yard of the house a black girl of about fourteen years old before her stood her mistress a white woman with a large stick in her hand She was undressed except her petticoat and chemise which had fallen down and left her shoulders and bosom bare Her hair was streaming behind and every fierce and malevolent passion was depicted in her face She too like my hostess at Governo another striking illustration of the dehumanizing effects of Slavery was the very representation of a fury She was striking the poor girl whom she had driven up into a corner where she was on her knees appealing for mercy She shewed her none but continued to strike her on the head and thrust the stick into her face till she was herself exhausted and her poor victim covered with blood This scene was renewed every morning and the cries and moans of the poor suffering blacks announced that they were enduring the penalty of slavery in being the objects on which the irritable and malevolent passions of the whites are allowed to vent themselves with impunity nor could I help deeply deploring that state of society in which the vilest characters in the community are allowed an almost uncontrolled power of life and death over their innocent and far more estimable fellow creatures Notices of Brazil vol ii p Page In conclusion I may observe that the history of Mary Prince furnishes a corollary to Lord Stowell's decision in the case of the slave Grace and that it is most valuable on this account Whatever opinions may be held by some readers on the grave question of immediately abolishing Colonial Slavery nothing assuredly can be more repugnant to the feelings of Englishmen than that the system should be permitted to extend its baneful influence to this country Yet such is the case when the slave landed in England still only possesses that qualified degree of freedom that a change of domicile will determine it Though born a British subject and resident within the shores of England he is cut off from his dearest natural rights by the sad alternative of regaining them at the expence of liberty and the certainty of severe treatment It is true that he has the option of returning but it is a cruel mockery to call it a voluntary choice when upon his return depend his means of subsistence and his re union with all that makes life valuable Here he has tasted the sweets of freedom to quote the words of the unfortunate Mary Prince but if he desires to restore himself to his family or to escape from suffering and destitution and the other evils of a climate uncongenial to his constitution and habits he must abandon the enjoyment of his late acquired liberty and again subject himself to the arbitrary power of a vindictive master The case of Mary Prince is by no means a singular one many of the same kind are daily occurring and even if the case were singular it would still loudly call for the interference of the legislature In instances of this kind no injury can possibly be done to the owner by confirming to the slave his resumption of his natural rights It is the master's spontaneous act to bring him to this country he knows when he brings him that he divests himself of his property and it is in fact a minor species of slave trading when he has thus enfranchised his slave to re capture that slave by the necessities of his condition or by working upon the better feelings of his heart Abstractedly from all legal technicalities there is no real difference between thus compelling the return of the enfranchised negro and trepanning a free native of England by delusive hopes into perpetual slavery The most ingenious casuist could not point out any essential distinction between the two cases Our boasted liberty is the dream of imagination and no longer the characteristic of our country if its bulwarks can thus be thrown down by colonial special pleading It would well become the character of the present Government to introduce a Bill into the Legislature making perpetual that freedom which the slave has acquired by his passage here and thus to declare in the most ample sense of the words what indeed we had long fondly believed to be the fact though it now appears that we have been mistaken THAT NO SLAVE CAN EXIST WITHIN THE SHORES OF GREAT BRITAIN Page APPENDIX As inquiries have been made from various quarters respecting the existence of marks of severe punishment on Mary Prince's body it seems proper to append to this Edition the following letter on that subject written by Mrs Pringle to Mrs Townsend one of the benevolent Secretaries of the Birmingham Ladies' Society for Relief of Negro Slaves London Solly Terrace Claremont Square March Dear Madam My husband having read to me the passage in your last letter to him expressing a desire to be furnished with some description of the marks of former ill usage on Mary Prince's person I beg in reply to state that the whole of the back part of her body is distinctly scarred and as it were chequered with the vestiges of severe floggings Besides this there are many large scars on other parts of her person exhibiting an appearance as if the flesh had been deeply cut or lacerated with gashes by some instrument wielded by most unmerciful hands Mary affirms that all these scars were occasioned by the various cruel punishments she has mentioned or referred to in her narrative and of the entire truth of this statement I have no hesitation in declaring myself perfectly satisfied not only from my dependence on her uniform veracity but also from my previous observation of similar cases at the Cape of Good Hope In order to put you in possession of such full and authentic evidence respecting the marks on Mary Prince's person as may serve your benevolent purpose in making the inquiry I beg to add to my own testimony that of Miss Strickland the lady who wrote down in this house the narratives of Mary Prince and Ashton Warner together with the testimonies of my sister Susan and my friend Miss Martha Browne all of whom were present and assisted me this day in a second inspection of Mary's body I remain Dear Madam Yours very truly M PRINGLE The above statement is certified and corroborated by SUSANNA STRICKLAND SUSAN BROWN MARTHA A BROWNE To Mrs Townsend West

ingenuity can devise or power effect but a Total Extinction Why ought slavery be abolished Because it is incurable injustice Why is injustice to remain for a single hour William Pitt PUBLISHED AND SOLD FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS RELATIONS STILL IN SLAVERY LONDON C GILPIN BISHOPS GATE STREET It is not improbable that some of the proper names in the following s are incorrectly spelled M G owing to the laws of the slave states being perfectly illiterate his pronunciation is the only guide DUBLIN PRINTED BY WEBB AND CHAPMAN GREAT BRUNSWICK ST iii INTRODUCTION ABOUT a fortnight ago the subject of the following brief Memoir came to me bearing with him a letter from a dear friend and distinguished abolitionist in the United States from which the following is an extract I seize my pen in haste to gratify a most worthy coloured friend of mine by giving him a letter of introduction to you as he intends sailing this week August th for Liverpool and London via New Orleans His name is Moses Grandy He knows what it is to have been a slave and what are the tender mercies of the southern slave drivers His history is not only authentic but most extraordinary and full of thrilling iv interest Could it published it would make a deep sensation in every quarter He was compelled to buy his freedom three times over He paid for it dollars nearly sterling He has since bought his wife and one or two of his children and before going to England will first go to New Orleans to purchase some of his other children if he can find them who are still held in captivity His benevolence affection kindness of heart and elasticity of spirit are truly remarkable He has a good head a fine countenance and a great spirit notwithstanding his education has been obtained in the horrible school of slavery Just get him to tell you his narrative and if you happen to have an Anti slavery Meeting let him tell his tale to a British audience In the letter of another highly esteemed friend he is spoken of as unsurpassed for faithfulness and perseverance In the letter v of a third as a worthy and respectable man On examining a book containing a list of the donations made him by American friends in aid of his noble design to rescue from the miseries of slavery his relations I found the names and certificates of persons of the highest respectability It will be amply sufficient with those who are acquainted with the abolitionists of the United States for me to name General Fessenden and Nathan Winslow Esq of Portland Maine the Rev A A Phelps Ellis Gray Loring and Samuel E Sewall Esqs of Boston Massachusetts Being satisfied by these indubitable vouchers of Moses Grandy's title to credit I listened to his artless tale with entire confidence and with a feeling of interest which all will participate who peruse the following s Considering his Narrative calculated to promote a more extensive knowledge of the workings of American slavery and that its vi sale might contribute to the object which engages so entirely the mind of Moses namely the redemption of those who are in bonds belonging to his family I resolved to commit it to the press as nearly as possible in the language of Moses himself I have carefully abstained from casting in a single reflection or animadversion of my own I leave the touching story of the self liberated captive to speak for itself and the wish of my heart will be gratified and my humble effort on his behalf be richly rewarded if this little book be the means of obtaining for my coloured brother the assistance which he seeks or of increasing the zeal of those who are associated for the purpose of breaking every yoke and setting the oppressed free GEORGE THOMPSON Blandford place Regent's park October th LIFE OF MOSES GRANDY MY name is Moses Grandy I was born in Camden County North Carolina I believe I am fifty six years old Slaves seldom know exactly how old they are neither they nor their masters set down the time of a birth the slaves because they are not allowed to write or read and the masters because they only care to know what slaves belong to them The master Billy Grandy whose slave I was born was a hard drinking man he sold away many slaves I remember four sisters and four brothers my mother had more children but they were dead or sold away before I can remember I was the youngest I remember well my mother often hid us all in the woods to prevent master selling us When we wanted water she sought for it in any hole or puddle formed by falling trees or otherwise it was often full of tadpoles and insects she strained it and gave it round to each of us in the hollow of her hand For food she gathered berries in the woods got potatoes raw corn c After a time the master would send word to her to come in promising he would not sell us But at length persons came who agreed to give the prices he set on us His wife with much to be done prevailed on him not to sell me but he sold my brother who was a little boy My mother frantic with grief resisted their taking her child away she was beaten and held down she fainted and when she came to herself her boy was gone She made much outcry for which the master tied her up to a peach tree in the yard and flogged her Another of my brothers was sold to Mr Tyler Dewan's Neck Pasquotank County this man very much ill treated many coloured boys One very cold day he sent my brother out naked and hungry to find a yoke of steers the boy returned without finding them when his master flogged him and sent him out again a white lady who lived near gave him food and advised him to try again he did so but it seems again without success He piled up a heap of leaves and laid himself down in them and died there He was found through a flock of turkey buzzards hovering over him these birds had pulled his eyes out My young master and I used to play together there was but two days' difference in our ages My old master always said he would give me to him When he died all the coloured people were divided amongst his children and I fell to young master his name was James Grandy I was then about eight years old When I became old enough to be taken away from my mother and put to field work I was hired out for the year by auction at the Court House every January this is the common practice with respect to slaves belonging to persons who are under age This continued till my master and myself were twenty one years old The first who hired me was Mr Kemp who used me pretty Well he gave me plenty to eat and sufficient clothing The next was old Jemmy Coates a severe man Because I could not learn his way of hilling corn he flogged me naked with a severe whip made of a very tough sapling this lapped round me at each stroke the point of it at last entered my belly and broke off leaving an inch and a half outside I was not aware of it until on going to work again it hurt my side very much when on looking down I saw it sticking out of my body I pulled it out and the blood spouted after it The wound festered and discharged very much at the time and hurt me for years after In being hired out sometimes the slave gets a good home and sometimes a bad one when he gets a good one he dreads to see January come when he has a bad one the year seems five times as long as it is I was next with Mr Enoch Sawyer of Camden county my business was to keep ferry and do other odd work It was cruel living we had not near enough of either victuals or clothes I was half starved for half my time I have often ground the husks of Indian corn over again in a hand mill for the chance of getting something to eat out of it which the former grinding had left In severe frosts I was compelled to go into the fields and woods to work with my naked feet cracked and bleeding from extreme cold to warm them I used to rouse an ox or hog and stand on the place where it had lain I was at that place three years and very long years they seemed to me The trick by which he kept me so long was this the Court House was but a mile off on hiring day he prevented me from going till he went himself and bid for me On the last occasion he was detained for a little while by other business so I ran as quickly as I could and got hired before he came up Mr George Furley was my next master he employed me as a car boy in the Dismal swamp I had to drive lumber I had plenty to eat and plenty of clothes I was so overjoyed at the change that I then thought I would not have left the place to go to heaven Next year I was hired by Mr John Micheau of the same county who married my young mistress one of the daughters of Mr Grandy and sister to my present owner This master gave us very few clothes and but little to eat I was almost naked One day he came into the field and asked why no more work was done The older people were afraid of him so I said that the reason was we were so hungry we could not work He went home and told the mistress to give us plenty to eat and at dinner time we had plenty We came out shouting for joy and went to work with delight From that time we had food enough and he soon found that he had a great deal more work done The field was quite alive with the people striving who should do most He hired me for another year He was a great gambler He kept me up five nights together without sleep night or day to wait on the gambling table I was standing in the corner of the room nodding for want of sleep when he took up the shovel and beat me with it he dislocated my shoulder and sprained my wrist and broke the shovel over me I ran away and got another person to hire me This person was Mr Richard Furley who after that hired me at the Court House every year till my master came of age He gave me a pass to work for myself so I obtained work by the piece where I could and paid him out of my earnings what we had agreed on I maintained myself on the rest and saved what I could In this way I was not liable to be flogged and ill used He paid seventy eighty or ninety dollars a year for me and I paid him twenty or thirty dollars a year more than that When my master came of age he took all his coloured people to himself Seeing that I was industrious and persevering and had obtained plenty of work he made me pay him almost twice as much as I had paid Mr Furley At that time the English blockaded the Chesapeake which made it necessary to send merchandize from Norfolk to Elizabeth city by the Grand Canal so that it might get to sea by Pamlico Sound and Ocracock Inlet I took some canal boats on shares Mr Grice who married my other young mistress was the owner of them I gave him one half of all I received for freight out of the other half I had to victual and man the boats and all over that expense was my own profit Some time before this my brother Benjamin returned from the West Indies where he had been two years with his master's vessel I was very glad to hear of it and got leave to go see him While I was sitting with his wife and him his wife's master came and asked him to fetch a can of water he did so and carried it into the store While I was waiting for him and wondering at his being so long away I heard the heavy blows of a hammer after a little while I was alarmed and went to see what was going on I looked into the store and saw my brother lying on his back on the floor and Mr Williams who had bought him driving staples over his wrists and ankles an iron bar was afterwards put across his breast which was also held down by staples I asked what he had been doing and was told that he had done nothing amiss but that his master had failed and he was sold towards paying the debts He lay in that state all that night next day he was taken to jail and I never saw him again This is the usual treatment under such circumstances I had to go by my mother's next morning but I feared to tell her what had happened to my brother I got a boy to go and tell her She was blind and very old and was living in a little hut in the woods after the usual manner of old worn out slaves she was unable to go to my brother before he was taken away and grieved after him greatly It was some time after this that I married a slave belonging to Mr Enoch Sawyer who had been so hard a master to me I left her at home that is at his house one Thursday morning when we had been married about eight months She was well and seemed likely to be so we were nicely getting together our little necessaries On the Friday as I was at work as usual with the boats I heard a noise behind me on the road which ran by the side of the canal I turned to look and saw a gang of slaves coming When they came up to me one of them cried out Moses my dear I wondered who among them should know me and found it was my wife She cried out to me I am gone I was struck with consternation Mr Rogerson was with them on his horse armed with pistols I said to him for God's sake have you bought my wife He said he had when I asked him what she had done he said she had done nothing but that her master wanted money He drew out a pistol and said that if I went near the waggon on which she was he would shoot me I asked for leave to shake hands with her which he refused but said I might stand at a distance and talk with her My heart was so full that I could say very little I asked leave to give her a dram he told Mr Burgess the man who was with him to get down and carry it to her I gave her the little money I had in my pocket and bid her farewell I have never seen or heard of her from that day to this I loved her as I loved my life Mr Grice found that I served him faithfully He and my young mistress his wife advised me as I was getting money fast to try to buy myself By their advice I asked my master what he would take for me He wanted dollars and when I said that was too much he replied he could get for me any minute Mr Grice afterwards went with me to him he said to him that I had already been more profitable to him than any five others of his negroes and reminded him that we had been playfellows in this way he got him to consent to take dollars for me I then went heartily to work and whenever I paid him for my time I paid him something also towards my freedom for which he gave me receipts When I made him the last payment of the dollars for my freedom he tore up all the receipts I told him he ought not to have done so he replied it did not signify for as soon as court day came he should give me my free papers On Monday in court week I went to him he was playing at billiards and would not go with me but told me to come again the next day the next day he did the same and so on daily I went to his sister Mrs Grice and told her I feared that he did not mean to give them to me she said she feared so too and sent for him He was a very wicked young man he came and cursed her and went out of the house Mr Grice was from home on his return he went to my master and told him he ought to give me my free papers that I had paid for myself and it was court week so that there was no excuse He promised he would instead of which he rode away and kept away till court was over Before the next court came he sold me to Mr Trewitt for dollars The way in which Mr Trewitt came to buy me was this I had left the boats and had gone with a schooner collecting lumber in Albemarle Sound for the merchants Coming to Elizabeth City I found a new store had been opened by Mr Grice which Mr Sutton was keeping the latter gentleman was glad to see me and was desirous that I should return to my old employment with the canal boats as lumber was in great demand at Norfolk I did so and sold some cargoes to Mr Moses Myers of Norfolk As I was waiting at the door of his store for settlement he came up with Mr Trewitt whom I did not then know Mr Myers said to Mr Trewitt here is a captain doing business for you Mr Trewitt then asked me who had chartered the boats and to whom I belonged I told him Mr Sutton had chartered me and that I had belonged to Mr James Grandy but had bought myself He said he would buy me on which Mr Myers told him he could not as I had already bought myself and further said I was one of their old war captains and had never lost a single thing of the property entrusted to me Mr Trewitt said he would buy me and would see about it as soon as he got to Elizabeth City I thought no more about it On my return voyage I delivered a cargo at Elizabeth City for Mr Trewitt I had been at Mr Grice's the owner of the boats and on my going away from him to meet Mr Trewitt for settlement he said he would go with me as he wanted money Opposite the Custom House we met Mr Trewitt who said Well captain I have bought you Mr Grice said Let us have no nonsense go and settle with him Angry words passed between them one saying he had bought me and the other denying that he had or could as I had bought myself already We all went to Mr Grice's dwelling house there Mr Trewitt settled with me about the freight and then jumping up said Now I will show you Mr Grice whether I am a liar or not He fetched the bill of sale on reading it Mr Grice's colour changed and he sent for Mrs Grice When she read it she began to cry seeing that I began to cry too She sent me to her brother who was at Mr Wood's boarding house He was playing at billiards I said to him Master James have you sold me He said No I said he had when he turned round and went into another room crying I followed him All the gentlemen followed us saying Captain Grandy what is the matter I told them Master James had sold me again They asked him why he had done it he said it was because people had jeered him by saying I had more sense than he had They would not suffer him to remain in the boarding house but turned him out there and then with all his trunks and boxes Mrs Grice his sister sued him in my name for my liberty but he gained the cause the court maintained that I and all I could do belonged to him and that he had a right to do as he pleased with me and all my earnings as his own property until he had taken me to the Court House and given me my free papers and until besides that I had been a year and a day in the Northern States to gain my residence So I was forced to go to Mr Trewitt He agreed that if I would pay him the same wages as I paid my late master and the dollars he gave for me he would give me my free papers He bought two canal boats and taking me out of Mr Grice's employment set me to work them on the same terms as I did for my former master I was two years and a half in earning the dollars to pay for myself the second time Just when I had completed the payment he failed Oh Christmas eve he gave me a letter to take to Mr Mews at Newbegun Creek I was rather unwilling to take it wishing to go to my wife I told him too I was going to his office to settle with him He offered to give me two dollars to take the letter and said he would settle when I came back then Mr Shaw came from another room and said his vessel was ready loaded but he had nobody he could trust with his goods he offered me five dollars to take the vessel down and deliver the goods to Mr Knox who also was at Newbegun Creek The wind was fair and the hands on board so I agreed it being Christmas eve I was glad of something to carry to my wife I ran the vessel down to the mouth of the Creek and anchored when the moon rose I went up the river I reached the wharf and commenced taking out the goods that night and delivered them all safely to Mr Knox next morning I then took the letter to Mr Mews who read it and looking up at me said Well you belong to me I thought he was joking and said How What way He said Don't you recollect when Trewitt chartered Wilson Sawyer's brig to the West Indies I said I did He told me Trewitt then came to him to borrow dollars which he would not lend except he had a mortgage on me Trewitt was to take it up at a certain time but never did I asked him whether he really took the mortgage on me He replied that he certainly thought Trewitt would have taken up the mortgage but he had failed and was not worth a cent and he Mews must have his money I asked him whether he had not helped me and my young mistress in the Court House when Master James fooled me before He said he did help me all he could and that he should not have taken a mortgage on me but that he thought Trewitt would take it up Trewitt must have received some of the last payments from me after he had given the mortgage and knew he should fail for the mortgage was given two months before this time My head seemed to turn round and round I was quite out of my senses I went away towards the woods Mr Mews sent his waiter after me to persuade me to go back at first I refused but afterwards went He told me he would give me another chance to buy myself and I certainly should have my freedom this time He said Mr Enoch Sawyer wanted to buy me to be his overseer in the Swamp I replied I would never try again to buy myself and that they had already got dollars from me My wife this was my second It will be observed that the narrator married a second wife without having heard of the decease of the first To explain this fact it is necessary to state that the frequent occurrence of cases where husbands and wives members of Christian societies were finally separated by sale led the ministers some years ago to deliberate on the subject they decided that such a separation might be considered as the death of the parties to each other and they therefore agreed to consider subsequent marriages not immoral The practice is general It is scarcely necessary to remark that a more unequivocal and impressive proof of the heinous nature of the system could hardly exist It breaks up the fondest connexions it tears up the holiest attachments and induces the ministers of religion as much as in them lies to garble the divine law to suit its own infernal exigencies wife belonged to Mr Sawyer he told me that her master would not allow me to go to see her if I would not consent to what he now preposed for any coloured person going on the grounds of a white man after being warned of is liable to be flogged or even shot I thus found myself forced to go although no coloured man wishes to live at the house where his wife lives for he has to endure the continual misery of seeing her flogged and abused without daring to say a word in her defence In the service of Mr Sawyer I got into a fair way of buying myself again for I undertook the lightering of the shingles or boards out of the Dismal Swamp and hired hands to assist me But my master had become security for his two sons in law at Norfolk who failed in consequence of which he sold eighteen coloured people his share of the Swamp and two plantations I was one of the slaves he kept and after that had to work in the corn field the same as the rest The overseer was a bad one his name was Brooks The horn was blown at sunrise the coloured people had then to march before the overseer to the field He on horseback We had to work even in long summer days till twelve o'clock before we tasted a morsel men women and children all being served alike At noon the cart appeared with our breakfast It was in large trays and was set on the ground There was bread of which a piece was cut off for each person then there was small hominy boiled that is Indian corn ground in the hand mill and besides this two herrings for each of the men and women and one for each of the children Our drink was the water in the ditches whatever might be its state if the ditches were dry water was brought to us by boys The salt fish made us always thirsty but no other drink than water was ever allowed However thirsty a slave may be he is not allowed to leave his employment for a moment to get water he can only have it when the hands in working have reached the ditch at the end of the rows The overseer stood with his watch in his hand to give us just an hour when he said rise we had to rise and go to work again The women who had children laid them down by the hedge row and gave them straws and other trifles to play with here they were in danger from snakes I have seen a large snake found coiled round the neck and face of a child when its mother went to suckle it at dinner time The hands work in a line by the side of each other the overseer puts the swiftest hands in the fore row and all must keep up with them One black man is kept on purpose to whip the others in the field if he does not flog with sufficient severity he is flogged himself he whips severely to keep the whip from his own back If a man has a wife in the same field with himself he chooses a row by the side of hers that with extreme labour he may if possible help her But he will not be in the same field if he can help it for with his hardest labour he often cannot save her from being flogged and he is obliged to stand by and see it he is always liable to see her taken home at night stripped naked and whipped before all the men On the estate I am speaking of those women who had sucking children suffered much from their breasts becoming full of milk the infants being left at home they therefore could not keep up with the other hands I seen the overseer beat them with raw hide so that blood and milk flew mingled from their breasts A woman who gives offence in the field and is large in the family way is compelled to lie down over a hole made to receive her and is then flogged with the whip or beaten with a paddle which has holes in it at every hole comes a blister One of my sisters was so severely punished in this way that labour was brought on and the child was born in the field This very overseer Mr Brooks killed in this manner a girl named Mary her father and mother were in the field at the time He also killed a boy about twelve years old He had no punishment or even trial for either There was no dinner till dark when he gave the order to knock off and go home The meal then was the same as in the morning except that we had meat twice a week On very few estates are the coloured people provided with any bedding the best masters give only a blanket this master gave none A board which the slave might pick up anywhere on the estate was all he had to lie on If he wished to procure bedding he could only do so by working at nights For warmth therefore the negroes generally sleep near a large fire whether in the kitchen or in their log huts their legs are often in this way blistered and greatly swelled and sometimes badly burnt they suffer severely from this cause When the water mill did not supply meal enough we had to grind with the hand mill The night was employed in this work without any thing being taken from the labour of the day We had to take turn at it women as well as men enough was to be ground to serve for the following day I was eight months in the field My master Mr Sawyer agreed to allow me eight dollars a month while so employed towards buying myself it will be seen he did not give me even that When I first went to work in the corn field I had paid him dollars towards this third buying of my freedom I told him one night I could not stand his field work any longer he asked why I said I was almost starved to death and had long been unaccustomed to this severe labour He wanted to know why I could not stand it as well as the rest I told him he knew well I had not been used to it for a long time that his overseer was the worst that had ever been on the plantation and that I could not stand it He said he would direct Mr Brooks to give each of us a pint of meal or corn every evening which we might bake and which would serve us next morning till our breakfast came at noon The black people were much rejoiced that I got this additional allowance for them But I was not satisfied I wanted liberty One Sunday morning as Master was sitting in his porch I went to him and offered to give him the dollars I had already paid him if beside them he would take for my freedom the dollars he had given for me He drove me away saying I had no way to get the money I sat down for a time and went to him again I repeated my offer to procure the dollars and he again said I could not He called his wife out of the room to the porch and said to her Don't you think Moses has taken to getting drunk She asked me if it was so I denied it when she inquired what was the matter Master replied Don't you think he wants me to sell him She said Moses we would not take any money for you Captain Cormack put a thousand dollars for you on the supper table last Friday night and Mr Sawyer would not touch it he wants you to be overseer in the Dismal Swamp I replied Captain Cormack never said anything to me about buying me I would cut my throat from ear to ear rather than go to him I know what made him say so he is courting Miss Patsey and he did it to make himself look big Mistress laughed and turned away and slammed to the door Master shook himself with laughing and put the paper he was reading before his face knowing that I spoke the truth Captain Cormack was an old man who went on crutches Miss Patsey was the finest of master's daughters Master drove me away from him again On Monday morning Mr Brooks the overseer blew the horn as usual for all to go to the field I refused to go I went to master and told him that if he would give me a paper I would go and fetch the dollars he then gave me a paper stating that he was willing to take that sum for my freedom so I hired an old horse and started for Norfolk fifty miles off When I reached Deep Creek I went to the house of Captain Edward Minner He was very glad to see me for in former days I had done much business for him he said how sorry he had been to hear that I was at field work He inquired where I was going I said to Norfolk to get some of the merchants to let me have money to buy myself He replied What did I always say to you Was it not that I would let you have the money at any time if you would only tell me when you could be sold He called Mrs Minner into the room and told her I could be sold for my freedom she was rejoiced to hear it He said Put up your horse at Mr Western's Tavern for you need go no farther I have plenty of old rusty dollars and no man shall put his hand on your collar again to say you are a slave Come and stay with me to night and in the morning I will get Mr Garrett's horse and go with you Next morning we set off and found master at Major Farrance's at the cross canal where I knew he was to be that day to sell his share of the canal When I saw him he told me to go forward home for he would not sell me I felt sick and sadly disappointed Captain Minner stepped up to him and shewed him the paper he had given me saying Mr Sawyer is not this your handwriting He replied Mistress said the last word when I came away I was not to sell him but send him home again Captain Minner said Mind gentlemen I do not want him for a slave I want to buy him for freedom He will repay me the money and I shall not charge him a cent of interest for it I would not have a coloured person to drag me down to hell for all the money in the world A gentleman who was by said it was a shame I should be so treated I had bought myself so often that Mr Sawyer ought to let me go The very worst man as an overseer over the persons employed in digging the canal Mr Wiley M'Pherson was there he was never known to speak in favour of a coloured person even he said that Mr Sawyer ought to let me go as I had been sold so often At length Mr Sawyer consented I should go for dollars and would take no less I wished Captain Minner to give the extra dollars and not to stand about it I believe it was what M'Pherson said that induced my master to let me go for he was well known for his great severity to coloured people so that after even he had said so master could not stand out The Lord must have opened M'Pherson's heart to say it I have said this M'Pherson was an overseer where slaves were employed in cutting canals The labour there is very severe The ground is often very boggy the negroes are up to the middle or much deeper in mud and water cutting away roots and baling out mud if they can keep their heads above water they work on They lodge in huts or as they are called camps made of shingles or boards They lie down in the mud which has adhered to them making a great fire to dry themselves and keep off the cold No bedding whatever is allowed them it is only by work done over his task that any of them can get a blanket They are paid nothing except for this overwork Their masters come once a month to receive the money for their labour then perhaps some few very good masters will give them two dollars each some others one dollar some a pound of tobacco and some nothing at all The food is more abundant than that of field slaves indeed it is the best allowance in America it consists of a peck of meal and six pounds of pork per week the pork is commonly not good it is damaged and is bought as cheap as possible at auctions M'Pherson gave the same task to each slave of course the weak ones often failed to do it I have often seen him tie up persons and flog them in the morning only because they were unable to get the previous day's task done after they were flogged pork or beef brine was put on their bleeding backs to increase the pain he sitting by resting himself and seeing it done After being thus flogged and pickled the sufferers often remained tied up all day the feet just touching the ground the legs tied and pieces of wood put between the legs All the motion allowed was a slight turn of the neck Thus exposed and helpless the yellow flies and musquitoes in great numbers would settle on the bleeding and smarting back and put the sufferer to extreme torture This continued all day for they were not taken down till night In flogging he would sometimes tie the slave's shirt over his head that he might not flinch when the blow was coming sometimes he would increase his misery by blustering and calling out that he was coming to flog again which he did or did not as happened I have seen him flog slaves with his own hands till their entrails were visible and I have seen the sufferers dead when they were taken down He never was called to account in any way for it It is not uncommon for flies to blow the sores made by flogging In that case we get a strong weed growing in those parts called the Oak of Jerusalem we boil it at night and wash the sores with the liquor which is extremely bitter on this the creepers or maggots come out To relieve them in some degree after severe flogging their fellow slaves rub their backs with part of their little allowance of fat meat For fear the slaves should run away while unable to work from flogging He kept them chained till they could work again This man had from to men under his control When out of other employment I sometimes worked under him and saw his doings I believe it was the word of this man which gained my freedom He is dead but there are yet others like him on public works When the great kindness of Captain Minner had set me clear of Mr Enoch Sawyer I went to my old occupation of working the canal boats These I took on shares as before After a time I was disabled for a year from following this employment by a severe attack of rheumatism caught by frequent exposure to severe weather I was anxious however to be earning something towards the repayment of Captain Minner lest any accident unforeseen by him or me should even yet deprive me of the liberty for which I so longed and for which I had suffered so much I therefore had myself carried in a lighter up a cross canal in the Dismal Swamp and to the other side of Drummond's Lake I was left on the shore and there I built myself a little hut and had provisions brought to me as opportunity served Here among snakes bears and panthers whenever my strength was sufficient I cut down a juniper tree and converted it into cooper's timber The camp like those commonly set up for negroes was entirely open on one side on that side a fire is lighted at night and the person sleeping puts his feet towards it One night I was awoke by some large animal smelling my face and snuffing strongly I felt its cold muzzle I suddenly thrust out my arms and shouted with all my might it was frightened and made off I do not know whether it was a bear or a panther but it seemed as tall as a large calf I slept of course no more that night I put my trust in the Lord and continued on the spot I was never attacked again I recovered and went to the canal boats again By the end of three years from the time he laid down the money I entirely repaid my very kind and excellent friend During this time he made no claim whatever on my services I was altogether on the footing of a free man as far as a coloured man can there be free When at length I had repaid Captain Minner and had got my free papers so that my freedom was quite secure my feelings were greatly excited I felt to myself so light that I almost thought I could fly and in my sleep I was always dreaming of flying over woods and rivers My gait was so altered by my gladness that people often stopped me saying Grandy what is the matter I excused myself as well as I could but many perceived the reason and said Oh he is so pleased with having got his freedom Slavery will teach any man to be glad when he gets freedom My good master Captain Minner sent me to Providence in Rhode Island to stay a year and a day in order to gain my residence But I stayed only two months Mr Howard's vessel came there laden with corn I longed much to see my master and mistress for the kindness they had done me and so went home in the schooner On my arrival I did not stop at my own house except to ask my wife at the door how she and the children were in health but went up the town to see Captain and Mrs Minner They were very glad to see me and consulted with me about my way of getting a living I wished to go on board the New York and Philadelphia Packets but feared I should be troubled for my freedom Captain Minner thought I might venture and I therefore engaged myself I continued in that employment till his death which happened about a year after my return from Providence Then I returned to Boston for while he lived I knew I could rely on his protection but when I lost my friend I thought it best to go wholly to the Northern States At Boston I went to work at sawing wood sawing with the whip saw labouring in the coal yards loading and unloading vessels c After labouring in this way for a few months I went a voyage to St John's in Porto Rico with Captain Cobb in the schooner New Packet On the return voyage the vessel got ashore on Cape Cod we left her after doing in vain what we could to right her she was afterwards recovered I went several other voyages and particularly two to the Mediterranean The last was to the East Indies in the ship James Murray Captain Woodbury owner Mr Gray My entire savings up to the period of my return from this voyage amounted to dollars I sent it to Virginia and bought my wife She came to me at Boston I dared not go myself to fetch her lest I should be again deprived of my liberty as often happens to free coloured people At the time called the time of the Insurrection about eight years ago when the whites said the coloured people were going to rise and shot hanged and otherwise destroyed many of them Mrs Minner thought she saw me in the street and fainted there The soldiers were seizing all the blacks they could find and she knew if I were there I should be sure to suffer with the rest She was mistaken I was not there My son's master at Norfolk sent a letter to me at Boston to say that if I could raise dollars I might have his freedom he was then fifteen years old I had again saved dollars I knew the master was a drinking man and I was therefore very anxious to get my son out of his hands I went to Norfolk running the risk of my liberty and took my dollars with me to make the best bargain I could Many gentlemen my friends in Boston advised me not to go myself but I was anxious to get my boy's freedom and I knew that nobody in Virginia had any cause of complaint against me so notwithstanding their advice I determined to go When the vessel arrived there they said it was against the law for me to go ashore The mayor of the city said I had been among the cursed Yankees too long He asked me whether I did not know that it was unlawful for me to land to which I replied that I did not know it for I could neither read nor write The merchants for whom I had formerly done business came on board and said they cared for neither the mare mayor nor the horse and insisted that I should go ashore I told the mayor the business on which I came and he gave me leave to stay nine days telling me that if I were not gone in that time he would sell me for the good of the State I offered my boy's master the dollars he counted the money but put it back to me refusing to take less than dollars I went on board to return to Boston We met with head winds and put back three times to Norfolk anchoring each time Just opposite the jail The nine days had expired and I feared the mayor would find me on board and sell me I could see the jail full of coloured people and even the whipping post at which they were constantly enduring the lash While we were lying there by the jail two vessels came from Eastern Shore Virginia laden with cattle and coloured people The cattle were lowing for their calves and the men and women were crying for their husbands wives or children The cries and groans were terrible notwithstanding there was a whipper on board each vessel trying to compel the poor creatures to keep silence These vessels lay close to ours I had been a long time away from such scenes the sight affected me very much and added greatly to my fears One day I saw a boat coming from the shore with white men in it I thought they were officers coming to take me and such was my horror of slavery that I twice ran to the ship's waist to jump overboard into the strong ebb tide then running to drown myself but a strong impression on my mind restrained me each time Once more we got under way for New York but meeting again with head winds we ran into Maurice's River in Delaware Bay New Jersey in which that place lies is not a slave state So I said to the captain Let me have a boat and set me on the free land once more then I will travel home overland for I will not run the risk of going back to Virginia any more The captain said there was no danger but I exclaimed No no captain I will not try it put my feet on free land once again and I shall be safe When I once more touched the free land the burthen of my mind was removed if two ton weight had been taken of me the relief would not have seemed so great From Maurice's Creek I traveled to Philadelphia and at that place had a letter written to my wife at Boston thanking God that I was on free land again On arriving at Boston I borrowed dollars of a friend and going to New York I obtained the help of Mr John Williams to send the dollars to Norfolk thus at length I bought my son's freedom I met him at New York and brought him on to Boston Six others of my children three boys and three girls were sold to New Orleans Two of these daughters have bought their own freedom The eldest of them Catherine was sold three times after she was taken away from Virginia the first time was by auction Her last master but one was a Frenchman she worked in his sugar cane and cotton fields Another Frenchman inquired for a girl on whom he could depend to wait on his wife who was in a consumption Her master offered him my daughter they went into the field to see her and the bargain was struck Her new master gave her up to his sick wife on whom she waited till her death As she had waited exceedingly well on his wife her master offered her a chance of buying her freedom She objected to his terms as too high for he required her to pay him four dollars a week out of her earnings and dollars for her freedom He said he could get more for her and told her she might get plenty of washing at a dollar a dozen at last she agreed She lived near the river side and obtained plenty of work So anxious was she to obtain her freedom that she worked nearly all her time days and nights and Sundays She found however she gained nothing by working on Sundays and therefore left it off She paid her master punctually her weekly hire and also something towards her freedom for which he gave her receipts A good stewardess was wanted for a steam boat on the Mississippi she was hired for the place at thirty dollars a month which is the usual salary she also had liberty to sell apples and oranges on board and commonly the passengers give from twenty five cents to a dollar to a stewardess who attends them Well Her entire incoming wages and all amounted to about sixty dollars a month She remained at this employment till she had paid the entire sum of dollars for her freedom As soon as she obtained her free papers she left the steam boat thinking she could find her sister Charlotte Her two first trials were unsuccessful but On the third attempt she found her at work in the cane field She shewed her sister's master her own free papers and told him how she had bought herself he said that if her sister would pay him as much as she paid her master she might go too They agreed and he gave her a pass The two sisters went on board a steam boat and worked together for the wages of one till they had saved the entire dollars for the freedom of the second sister The husband of Charlotte was dead her children were left behind in the cotton and cane fields their master refuses to take less than dollars for them their names and ages are as follows Zeno about fifteen Antoinette about thirteen Joseph about eleven and Josephine about ten years old Of my other children I only know that one a girl named Betsy is a little way from Norfolk in Virginia Her master Mr William Dixon is willing to sell her for dollars I do not know where any of my other four children are nor whether they be dead or alive It will be very difficult to find them out for the names of slaves are commonly changed with every change of master they usually bear the name of the master to whom they belong at the time They have no family name of their own by which they can be traced Owing to this circumstance and their ignorance of reading and writing to which they are compelled by law all trace between parents and their children who are separated from them in childhood is lost in a few years When therefore a child is sold away from its mother she feels that she is parting from it for ever there is little likelihood of her ever knowing what of good or evil befals it The way of finding out a friend or relative who has been sold away for any length of time or to any great distance is to trace him if possible to one master after another or if that cannot be done to inquire about the neighbourhood where he is supposed to be until some one is found who can tell that such a person belonged to such or such a master and the person supposed to be the one sought for may perhaps remember the names of the persons to whom his father and mother belonged There is little to be learnt from his appearance for so many years may have passed away that he may have grown out of the memory of his parents or his nearest relations There are thus no lasting family ties to bind relations together not even the nearest and this aggravates their distress when they are sold from each other I have little hope of finding my four children again I have lived at Boston ever since I bought my freedom except during the last year which I have spent at Portland in the state of Maine I have yet said nothing of my father He was often sold through the failure of his successive owners When I was a little boy he was sold away from us to a distance he was then so far off that he could not come to see us oftener than once a year After that he was sold to go still further away and then he could not come at all I do not know what has become of him When my mother became old she was sent to live in a little lonely log hut in the woods Aged and worn out slaves whether men or women are commonly so treated No care is taken of them except perhaps that a little ground is cleared about the hut on which the old slave if able may raise a little corn As far as the owner is concerned they live or die as it happens is is just the same thing as turning out an old horse Their children or other near relations if living in the neighbourhood take it by turns to go at night with a supply saved out of their own scanty allowance of food as well as to cut wood and fetch water for them this is done entirely through the good feelings of the slaves and not through the masters' taking care that it is done On these night visits the aged inmate of the hut is often found crying on account of sufferings from disease or extreme weakness or from want of food and water in the course of the day many a time when I have drawn near to my mother's hut I have heard her grieving and crying on these accounts she was old and blind too and so unable to help herself She was not treated worse than others it is the general practice Some few good masters do not treat their old slaves so they employ them in doing light jobs about the house and garden My eldest sister is in Elizabeth City She has five children who of course are slaves Her master is willing to sell her for dollars she is growing old One of her children a young man cannot be bought under dollars My sister Tamar who belonged to the same master with myself had children very fast Her husband had hard owners and lived at a distance When a woman who has many children belongs to an owner who is under age as ours was it is customary to put her and the children out yearly to the person who will maintain them for the least money the person taking them having the benefit of whatever work the woman can do But my sister was put to herself in the woods She had a bit of ground cleared and was left to hire herself out to labour On the ground she raised corn and flax and obtained a peck of corn some herrings or a piece of meat for a day's work among the neighbouring owners In this way she brought up her children Her husband could help her but little As soon as each of the children became big enough it was sold away from her After parting thus with five she was sold along with the sixth about a year and a half old to the speculators these are persons who buy slaves in Carolina and Virginia to sell them in Georgia and New Orleans After travelling with them more than miles she made her escape but could not obtain her child to take it with her On her journey homeward she traveled by night and hid herself in thick woods by day She was in great danger on the road but in three weeks reached the woods near us There she had to keep herself concealed I my mother and her husband knew where she was she lived in a den she made for herself She sometimes ventured down to my mother's hut where she was hid in a hollow under the floor Her husband lived twenty five miles off he would sometimes set off after his day's work was done spend part of the night with her and get back to work before next sunrise sometimes he would spend Sunday with her We all supplied her with such provisions as we could save It was necessary to be very careful in visiting her we tied pieces of wood or bundles of rags to our feet that no track might be made In the wood she had three children born one of them died She had not recovered from the birth of the youngest when she was discovered and taken to the house of her old master She was afterwards sold to Culpepper who used her very cruelly He was beating her dreadfully and the blood was streaming from her head and back one day when I happened to go to his house I was greatly grieved and asked his leave to find a person to buy her instead of answering me he struck at me with an axe and I was obliged to get away as fast as I could Soon after he failed and she was offered for sale in Norfolk there Mr Johnson bought her and her two children out of friendship for me he treated her exceedingly well and she served him faithfully but it was not long before she was claimed by a person to whom Culpepper had mortgaged her before he sold her to Johnson This person sold her to Long of Elizabeth City where again she was very badly treated After a time Long sold her to go to Georgia she was very in at the time and was taken away in a cart I hear from her sometimes and am very anxious to purchase her freedom if ever I should be able Two of her children are now in North Carolina and are longing to obtain their freedom I know nothing of the others nor am I likely ever to hear of them again The treatment of slaves is mildest near the borders where the free and slave states join it becomes more severe the further we go from the free states It is more severe in the west and south than where I lived The sale of slaves most frequently takes place from the milder to the severer parts in that directtion there is great traffic in slaves which is carried on by the speculators On the frontier between the slave and free states there is a guard no coloured person can go over a ferry without a pass By these regulations and the great numbers of patrols escape is made very difficult Formerly slaves were allowed to have religious meetings of their own but after the insurrection which I spoke of before they were forbidden to meet even for worship Often they are flogged if they are found singing or praying at home They may go to the places of worship used by the whites but they like their own meetings better My wife's brother Isaac was a coloured preacher A number of slaves went privately into the wood to hold meetings when they were found out they were flogged and each was forced to tell who else was there Three were shot two of whom were killed and the other was badly wounded For preaching to them Isaac was flogged and his back pickled when he was nearly well he was flogged and pickled again and so on for some months then his back was suffered to get well and he was sold A little while before this his wife was sold away with an infant at her breast and of his six children four had been sold away by one at a time On the way with his buyers he dropped down dead his heart was broken Having thus narrated what has happened to myself my relatives and near friends I will add a few matters about slaves and coloured persons in general Slaves are under fear in every word they speak If in their master's kitchen they let slip an expression of discontent or a wish for freedom it is often reported to the master or mistress by the children of the family who may be playing about severe flogging is often the consequence I have already said that it is forbidden by law to teach coloured persons to read or write A few well disposed white young persons of the families to which the slaves belonged have ventured to teach them but they dare not let it be known they have done so The proprietors get new land cleared in this way They first dead a piece of ground in the woods adjoining the plantation By deading is meant killing the trees by cutting a nick all round each quite through the bark Out of this ground each coloured person has a piece as large as he can tend after his other work is done the women have pieces in like manner The slave works at night cutting down the timber and clearing the ground after it is cleared he has it for his own use for two or three years as may be agreed on As these new clearings lie between the woods and the old cultivated land the squirrels and racoons first come at the crops on them and thus those on the planters' land are saved from much waste When the negro has had the land for the specified time and it has become fit for the plough the master takes it and he is removed to another new piece It is no uncommon thing for the land to be taken from him before the time is out if it has sooner become fit for the plough When the crop is gathered the master comes to see how much there is of it he then gives the negro an order to sell that quantity without that order no storekeeper dare buy it The slave lays out the money in something tidy to go to meeting in and something to take to his wife The evidence of a black man or of ever so many black men stands for nothing against that of one white in consequence of this the free negroes are liable to great cruelties They have had their dwellings entered their bedding and furniture destroyed themselves their wives and children beaten some have even been taken with their wives into the woods and tied up flogged and left there There is nothing which a white man may not do against a black one if he only takes care that no other white man can give evidence against him A law has lately been passed in New Orleans prohibiting any free coloured person from going there The coasting packets of the ports on the Atlantic commonly have coloured cooks When a vessel goes from New York or Boston to a port in the slave holding estates the black cook is usually put in jail till the vessel sails again No coloured person can travel without a pass If he cannot show it he may be flogged by any body in such a case he often is seized and flogged by the patrols all through the slave states there are patrols they are so numerous that they cannot easily be escaped The only time when a man can visit his wife when they are on different estates is Saturday evening and Sunday If they be very near to each other he may sometimes see her on Wednesday evening He must always return to his work by sunrise if he fail to do so he is flogged When he has got together all the little things he can for his wife and children and has walked many miles to see them he may find that they have all been sold away some in one direction and some in another He gives up all hope of seeing them again but he dare not utter a word of complaint It often happens that when a slave wishes to visit his wife on another plantation his own master is busy or from home and therefore he cannot get a pass He ventures without it If there be any little spite against his wife or himself he maybe asked for it when he arrives and not having it he may be beaten with thirty nine stripes and sent away On his return he may be seized by the patrol and flogged again for the same reason and he will not wonder if he is again seized and beaten for the third time If a negro has given offence to the patrol even by so innocent a matter as dressing tidily to go to a place of worship he will be seized by one of them and another will tear up his pass while one is flogging him the others will look another way so when he or his master make complaint of his having been beaten without cause and he points out the person who did it the others will swear they saw no one beat him His oath being that of a black man would stand for nothing but he may not even be sworn and in such a case his tormentors are safe for they were the only whites present In all the slave states there are men who make a trade of whipping negroes they ride about inquiring for jobs of persons who keep no overseer if there is a negro to be whipped whether man or woman this man is employed when he calls and does it immediately his fee is half a dollar Widows and other females having negroes get them whipped in this way Many mistresses will insist on the slave who has been flogged begging pardon for her fault on her knees and thanking her for the correction A white man who lived near me in Camden county Thomas Evidge followed this business He was also sworn whipper at the Court House A law was passed that any white man detected in stealing should be whipped Mr Dozier frequently missed hogs and flogged many of his negroes on suspicion of stealing them when he could not in his suspicions fix on any one in particular he flogged them all round saying that he was sure of having punished the right one Being one day shooting in his woods he heard the report of another gun and shortly after met David Evidge the nephew of the whipper with one of his hogs on his back which had just been shot David was sent to prison convicted of the theft and sentenced to be flogged His uncle who vapoured about greatly in flogging slaves and taunted them with unfeeling speeches while he did it could not bear the thought of flogging his nephew and hired a man to do it The person pitched on chanced to be a sailor he laid it well on the thief pleased enough were the coloured people to see a white back for the first time subjected to the lash Another man of the same business George Wilkins did no greater credit to the trade Mr Carnie on Western Branch Virginia often missed corn from his barn Wilkins the whipper was very officious in pointing out this slave and that as very likely to be the thief with nothing against them but his insinuations some were severely punished being flogged by this very Wilkins and others at his instigation were sold away One night Mr Carnie unknown to his coloured people set a steel trap in the barn Some of the negroes passing the barn before morning saw Wilkins standing there but were not aware he was caught They called the master that he might seize the thief before he could escape he came and teased Wilkins during the night in the morning he exposed him to the view of the neighbours and then set him at liberty without further punishment The very severe punishments to which slaves are subjected for trifling offences or none at all their continued liability to all kinds of in usage without a chance of redress and the agonizing feelings they endure at being separated from the dearest connexions drive many of them to desperation and they abscond They hide themselves in the woods where they remain for months and in some cases for years When caught they are flogged with extreme severity their backs are pickled and the flogging repeated as before described After months of this torture the back is allowed to heal and the slave is sold away Especially is this done when the slave has attempted to reach a free state In violent thunder storms when the whites have got between feather beds to be safe from the lightning I have often seen negroes the aged as well as others go out and lifting up their hands thank God that judgment was coming at last So cruelly are many of them used that judgment they think would be a happy release from their horrible slavery The proprietors though they live in luxury generally die in debt their negroes are so hardly treated that no profit is made by their labour Many of them are great gamblers At the death of a proprietor it commonly happens that his coloured people are sold towards paying his debts So it must and will be with the masters while slavery continues when freedom is established I believe they will begin to prosper greatly Before I close this Narrative I ought to express my grateful thanks to the many friends in the Northern States who have encouraged and assisted me I shall never forget to speak of their kindness and to pray for their prosperity I am delighted to say that not only to myself but to very many other coloured persons they have lent a benevolent helping hand Last year gentlemen whom I know bought no less than ten families from slavery and this year they are pursuing the same good work But for these numerous and heavy claims on their means and their kindness I should have had no need to appeal to the generosity of the British public they would gladly have helped me to redeem all my children and relations When I first went to the Northern States which is about ten years ago although I was free as to the law I was made to feel severely the difference between persons of different colours No black man was admitted to the same seats in churches with the whites nor to the inside of public conveyances nor into street coaches or cabs we had to be content with the decks of steam boats in all weathers night and day not even our wives or children being allowed to go below however it might rain or snow or freeze in various other ways we were treated as though we were of a race of men below the whites But the abolitionists boldly stood up for us and through them things are much changed for the better Now we may sit in any part of many places of worship and are even asked into the pews of respectable white families many public conveyances now make no distinction between white and black We begin to feel that we are really on the same footing as our fellow citizens They see we can and do conduct ourselves with propriety and they are now admitting us in many cases to the same standing with themselves During the struggles which have procured for us this justice from our fellow citizens we have been in the habit of looking in public places for some well known abolitionists and if none that we knew were there we addressed any person dressed as a Quaker these classes always took our part against ill usage and we have to thank them for many a contest in our behalf We were greatly delighted by the zealous efforts and powerful eloquence in our cause of Mr George Thompson who came from our English friends to aid our suffering brethren He was hated and mobbed by bad men amongst the whites they put his life in great danger and threatened destruction to all who sheltered him We prayed for him and did all we could to defend him The Lord preserved him and thankful were we when he escaped from our country with his life At that time and ever since we have had a host of American friends who have laboured for the cause night and day they have nobly stood up for the rights and honour of the coloured man but they did so at first in the midst of scorn and danger Now thank God the case is very different Mr William Lloyd Garrison who was hunted for his life by a mob in the streets of Boston has lately been chairman of a large meeting in favour of abolition held in Fanueil Hall the celebrated public hall of Boston called the Cradle of Liberty I am glad to say also that numbers of my coloured brethren now escape from slavery some by purchasing their freedom others by quitting through many dangers and hardships the land of bondage The latter suffer many privations in their attempts to reach the free states They hide themselves during the day in the woods and swamps at night they travel crossing rivers by swimming or by boats they may chance to meet with and passing over hills and meadows which they do not know in these dangerous journeys they are guided by the north star for they only know that the land of freedom is in the north They subsist on such wild fruit as they can gather and as they are often very long on their way they reach the free states almost like skeletons On their arrival they have no friends but such as pity those who have been in bondage the number of which I am happy to say is increasing but if they can meet with a man in a broadbrimmed hat and Quaker coat they speak to him without fear relying on him as a friend At each place the escaped slave inquires for an abolitionist or a Quaker and these friends of the coloured man help them on their journey northwards until they are out of the reach of danger Our untiring friends the abolitionists once obtained a law that no coloured person should be seized as a slave within the free states this law would have been of great service to us by ridding us of all anxiety about our freedom while we remained there but I am sorry to say that it has lately been repealed and that now as before any coloured person who is said to be a slave may be seized in the free states and carried away no matter how long he may have resided there as also may his children and their children although they all may have been born there I hope this law will soon be altered again At present many escaped slaves are forwarded by their friends to Canada where under British rule they are quite safe There is a body of ten thousand of them in Upper Canada they are known for their good order and loyalty to the British government during the late troubles they could always be relied on for the defence of the British possessions against the lawless Americans who attempted to invade them As to the settlement of Liberia on the coast of Africa the free coloured people of America do not willingly go to it America is their home if their forefathers lived in Africa they themselves know nothing of that country None but free coloured people are taken there if they would take slaves they might have plenty of colonists Slaves will go any where for freedom We look very much to Great Britain and Ireland for help Whenever we hear of the British or Irish people doing good to black men we are delighted and run to tell each other the news Our kind friends the abolitionists are very much encouraged when they hear of meetings and speeches in England in our cause The first of August the day when the slaves in the West Indies were made free is always kept as a day of rejoicing by the American coloured free people I do hope and believe that the cause of freedom to the blacks is becoming stronger and stronger every day I pray for the time to come when freedom shall be established all over the world Then will men love as brethren they will delight to do good to one another and they will thankfully worship the Father of all And now I have only to repeat my hearty thanks to all who have done any thing towards obtaining liberty for my coloured brethren and especially to express my gratitude to those who have helped me to procure for myself my wife and some of my children the blessing of freedom a blessing of which none can know the value but he who has been a slave Whatever profit may be obtained by the sale of this book and all donations with which I may be favoured will be faithfully employed in redeeming my remaining children and relatives from the dreadful condition of slavery Mr Scoble the Secretary of the British and Foreign Anti slavery Society has

Sojourner-Truth,NARRATIVE OF SOJOURNER TRUTH A NORTHERN SLAVE EMANCIPATED FROM BODILY SERVITUDE BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN WITH A PORTRAIT SWEET is the virgin honey though the wild bee store it in a reed And bright the jewelled band that circleth an Ethiop's arm Pure are the grains of gold in the turbid stream of the Ganges And fair the living flowers that spring from the dull cold sod Wherefore thou gentle student bend thine ear to my speech For I also am as thou art our hearts can commune together To meanest matters will I stoop for mean is the lot of mortal I will rise to noblest themes for the soul hath a heritage of glory BOSTON PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR verso J B YERRINTON AND SON PRINTERS CORNHILL BOSTON v PREFACE THE following is the unpretending narrative of the life of a remarkable and meritorious woman a life which has been checkered by strange vicissitudes severe hardships and singular adventures Born a slave and held in that brutal condition until the entire abolition of slavery in the State of New York in she has known what it is to drink to the dregs the bitterest cup of human degradation That one thus placed on a level with cattle and swine and for so many years subjected to the most demoralizing influences should have retained her moral integrity to such an extent and cherished so successfully the religious sentiment in her soul shows a mind of no common order while it heightens the detestation that is felt in every humane bosom of that system of oppression which seeks to cripple the intellect impair the understanding and deprave the hearts of vi its victims a system which has subjected to its own foul purposes in the United States all that is wealthy talented influential and reputedly pious in an overwhelming measure O the 'fantastic tricks' which the American people are 'playing before high Heaven ' O their profane use of the sacred name of Liberty O their impious appeal to the God of the oppressed for his divine benediction while they are making merchandise of his image Do they not blush Nay they glory in their shame Once a year they take special pains to exhibit themselves to the world in all their republican deformity and Christian barbarity insanely supposing that they thus excite the envy admiration and applause of mankind The nations are looking at the dreadful spectacle with disgust and amazement However sunken and degraded they may be they are too elevated too virtuous too humane to be guilty of such conduct Their voice is heard saying 'Americans we hear your boasts of liberty your shouts of independence your declarations of hostility to every form of tyranny your assertions that all men are created free and equal and endowed by their Creator with an inalienable right to liberty the merry peal of your bells and the deafening roar of your artillery but mingling with all these and rising above them all we also hear the clanking of chains the shrieks and wailings of millions of your own countrymen whom you wickedly hold in a state of slavery as much more frightful than the oppression vii which your fathers resisted unto blood as the tortures of the Inquisition surpass the stings of an insect We see your banner floating proudly in the breeze from every flag staff and mast head in the land but its blood red stripes are emblematical of your own slave driving cruelty as you apply the lash to the flesh of your guiltless victim even the flesh of a wife and mother shrieking for the restoration of the babe of her bosom sold to the remorseless slave speculator We catch the gleam of your illuminated hills everywhere blazing with bonfires we mark your gay processions we note the number of your orators we listen to the recital of your revolutionary achievements we see you kneeling at the shrine of Freedom as her best her truest her sincerest worshippers Hypocrites liars adulterers tyrants men stealers atheists Professing to believe in the natural equality of the human race yet dooming a sixth portion of your immense population to beastly servitude and ranking them among your goods and chattels Professing to believe in the existence of a God yet trading in his image and selling those in the shambles for whose redemption the Son of God laid down his life Professing to be Christians yet withholding the Bible the means of religious instruction even the knowledge of the alphabet from a benighted multitude under terrible penalties Boasting of your democracy yet determining the rights of men by the texture of their hair and the color of their skin Assuming to be 'the land of the free and the home of the viii brave yet keeping in chains more slaves than any other nation not excepting slave cursed Brazil Prating of your morality and honesty yet denying the rites of marriage to three millions of human beings and plundering them of all their hard earnings Affecting to be horror struck in view of the foreign slave trade yet eagerly pursuing a domestic traffic equally cruel and unnatural and reducing to slavery not less than seventy thousand new victims annually Vaunting of your freedom of speech and of the press your matchless Constitution and your glorious Union yet denouncing as traitors and treating as outlaws those who have the courage and fidelity to plead for immediate untrammelled universal emancipation Monsters that ye are how can ye expect to escape the scorn of the world and the wrath of Heaven Emancipate your slaves if you would redeem your tarnished character if you would obtain forgiveness here and salvation hereafter Until you do so there will be a stain upon your national escutcheon which all the waters of the Atlantic cannot wash out ' It is thus that as a people we are justly subjected to the reproach the execration the derision of mankind and are made a proverb and a hissing among the nations We cannot plead not guilty every accusation that is registered against us is true the act of violence is in our hands the stolen property is in our possession our fingers are stained with blood the cup of our iniquity is full ix 'Just God and shall we calmly rest The Christian's scorn the Heathen's mirth Content to live the lingering jest And by word of a mocking earth Shall our own glorious land retain That curse which Europe scorns to bear Shall our own brethren drag the chain Which not even Russia's menials wear ' It is useless it is dreadful it is impious for this nation longer to contend with the Almighty All his attributes are against us and on the side of the oppressed Is it not a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God Who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth as 'a swift witness against the adulterers and against false swearers and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages the widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger from his right ' Wo to this bloody land it is all full of lies and robbery the prey departeth not and the sound of a whip is heard continually 'Judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth afar off for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter Yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey The Lord sees it and is displeased that there is no judgment and he hath put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and is clad with zeal as a cloak ' and unless we repent by immediately undoing the heavy burdens and letting the oppressed go free according to our deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries x recompense to his enemies 'The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed ' 'O give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever To him that smote Egypt in their first born for his mercy endureth for ever And overthrew Pharaoh and his hosts in the Red sea for his mercy endureth for ever ' 'Sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea Thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in the mighty waters ' 'Even so Lord God Almighty for so it seemeth good in thy sight ' 'Who is like unto thee O Lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders ' In this great contest of Right against Wrong of Liberty against Slavery who are the wicked if they be not those who like vultures and vampyres are gorging themselves with human blood if they be not the plunderers of the poor the spoilers of the defenceless the traffickers in 'slaves and the souls of men ' Who are the cowards if not those who shrink from manly argumentation the light of truth the concussion of mind and a fair field if not those whose prowess stimulated by whiskey potations or the spirit of murder grows rampant as the darkness of night approaches whose shouts and yells are savage and fiend like who furiously exclaim 'Down with free discussion down with the liberty of the press down with xi the right of petition down with constitutional law ' who rifle mail bags throw types and printing presses into the river burn public halls dedicated to 'Virtue Liberty and Independence' and assassinate the defenders of inalienable human rights And who are the righteous in this case if they be not those who will 'have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them ' who maintain that the laborer is worthy of his hire that the marriage institution is sacred that slavery is a system accursed of God that tyrants are the enemies of mankind and that immediate emancipation should be given to all who are pining in bondage Who are the truly brave if not those who demand for truth and error alike free speech a free press in open arena the right of petition AND NO QUARTERS if not those who instead of skulking from the light stand forth in the noon tide blaze of day and challenge their opponents to emerge from their wolf like dens that by a rigid examination it may be seen who has stolen the wedge of gold in whose pocket are the thirty pieces of silver and whose garments are stained with the blood of innocence It is hoped that the perusal of the following Narrative may increase the sympathy that is felt for the suffering colored population of this country and inspire to renewed efforts for the liberation of all who are pining in bondage on the American soil xii NOTE IT is due to the lady by whom the following Narrative was kindly written to state that she has not been able to see a single proof sheet of it consequently it is very possible that divers errors in printing may have occurred though it is hoped none materially affecting the sense especially in regard to the names of individuals referred to therein The name of Van Wagener should read Van Wagenen NARRATIVE OF SOJOURNER TRUTH HER BIRTH AND PARENTAGE THE subject of this biography SOJOURNER TRUTH as she now calls herself but whose name originally was lsabella was born as near as she can now calculate between the years and She was the daughter of James and Betsey slaves of one Colonel Ardinburgh Hurley Ulster County New York Colonel Ardinburgh belonged to that class of people called Low Dutch Of her first master she can give no account as she must have been a mere infant when he died and she with her parents and some ten or twelve other fellow human chattels became the legal property of his son Charles Ardinburgh She distinctly remembers hearing her father and mother say that their lot was a fortunate one as Master Charles was the best of the family being comparatively speaking a kind master to his slaves James and Betsey having by their faithfulness docility and respectful behavior won his particular regard received from him particular favors among which was a lot of land lying back on the slope of a mountain where by improving the pleasant evenings and Sundays they managed to raise a little tobacco corn or flax which they exchanged for extras in the articles of food or clothing for themselves and children She has no remembrance that Saturday afternoon was ever added to their own time as it is by some masters in the Southern States ACCOMMODATIONS Among Isabella's earliest recollections was the removal of her master Charles Ardinburgh into his new house which he had built for a hotel soon after the decease of his father A cellar under this hotel was assigned to his slaves as their sleeping apartment all the slaves he possessed of both sexes sleeping as is quite common in a state of slavery in the same room She carries in her mind to this day a vivid picture of this dismal chamber its only lights consisting of a few panes of glass through which she thinks the sun never shone but with thrice reflected rays and the space between the loose boards of the floor and the uneven earth below was often filled with mud and water the uncomfortable splashings of which were as annoying as its noxious vapors must have been chilling and fatal to health She shudders even now as she goes back in memory and revisits this cellar and sees its inmates of both sexes and all ages sleeping on those damp boards like the horse with a little straw and a blanket and she wonders not at the rheumatisms and fever sores and palsies that distorted the limbs and racked the bodies of those fellow slaves in after life Still she does not attribute this cruelty for cruelty it certainly is to be so unmindful of the health and comfort of any being leaving entirely out of sight his more important part his everlasting interests so much to any innate or constitutional cruelty of the master as to that gigantic inconsistency that inherited habit among slaveholders of expecting a willing and intelligent obedience from the slave because he is a MAN at the same time every thing belonging to the soul harrowing system does its best to crush the last vestige of a man within him and when it is crushed and often before he is denied the comforts of life on the plea that he knows neither the want nor the use of them and because he is considered to be little more or little less than a beast HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS Isabella's father was very tall and straight when young which gave him the name of 'Bomefree' low Dutch for tree at least this is SOJOURNER'S pronunciation of it and by this name he usually went The most familiar appellation of her mother was 'Mau mau Bett ' She was the mother of some ten or twelve children though Sojourner is far from knowing the exact number of her brothers and sisters she being the youngest save one and all older than herself having been sold before her remembrance She was privileged to behold six of them while she remained a slave Of the two that immediately preceded her in age a boy of five years and a girl of three who were sold when she was an infant she heard much and she wishes that all who would fain believe that slave parents have not natural affection for their offspring could have listened as she did while Bomefree and Mau mau Bett their dark cellar lighted by a blazing pine knot would sit for hours recalling and recounting every endearing as well as harrowing circumstance that taxed memory could supply from the histories of those dear departed ones of whom they had been robbed and for whom their hearts still bled Among the rest they would relate how the little boy on the last morning he was with them arose with the birds kindled a fire calling for his Mau mau to 'come for all was now ready for her' little dreaming of the dreadful separation which was so near at hand but of which his parents had an uncertain but all the more cruel foreboding There was snow on the ground at the time of which we are speaking and a large old fashioned sleigh was seen to drive up to the door of the late Col Ardinburgh This event was noticed with childish pleasure by the unsuspicious boy but when he was taken and put into the sleigh and saw his little sister actually shut and locked into the sleigh box his eyes were at once opened to their intentions and like a frightened deer he sprang from the sleigh and running into the house concealed himself under a bed But this availed him little He was re conveyed to the sleigh and separated for ever from those whom God had constituted his natural guardians and protectors and who should have found him in return a stay and a staff to them in their declining years But I make no comments on facts like these knowing that the heart of every slave parent will make its own comment involuntarily and correctly as soon as each heart shall make the case its own Those who are not parents will draw their conclusions from the promptings of humanity and philanthropy these enlightened by reason and revelation are also unerring HER RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION Isabella and Peter her youngest brother remained with their parents the legal property of Charles Ardinburgh till his decease which took place when Isabella was near nine years old After this event she was often surprised to find her mother in tears and when in her simplicity she inquired 'Mau mau what makes you cry ' she would answer Oh my child I am thinking of your brothers and sisters that have been sold away from me ' And she would proceed to detail many circumstances respecting them But Isabella long since concluded that it was the impending fate of her only remaining children which her mother but too well understood even then that called up those memories from the past and made them crucify her heart afresh In the evening when her mother's work was done she would sit down under the sparkling vault of heaven and calling her children to her would talk to them of the only Being that could effectually aid or protect them Her teachings were delivered in Low Dutch her only language and translated into English ran nearly as follows 'My children there is a God who hears and sees you ' 'A God mau mau Where does he live ' asked the children 'He lives in the sky ' she replied 'and when you are beaten or cruelly treated or fall into any trouble you must ask help of him and he will always hear and help you ' She taught them to kneel and say the Lord's prayer She entreated them to refrain from lying and stealing and to strive to obey their masters At times a groan would escape her and she would break out in the language of the Psalmist 'Oh Lord how long ' 'Oh Lord how long ' And in reply to Isabella's question 'What ails you mau mau ' her only answer was 'Oh a good deal ails me' 'Enough ails me ' Then again she would point them to the stars and say in her peculiar language 'Those are the same stars and that is the same moon that look down upon your brothers and sisters and which they see as they look up to them though they are ever so far away from us and each other ' Thus in her humble way did she endeavor to show them their Heavenly Father as the only being who could protect them in their perilous condition at the same time she would strengthen and brighten the chain of family affection which she trusted extended itself sufficiently to connect the widely scattered members of her precious flock These instructions of the mother were treasured up and held sacred by Isabella as our future narrative will show THE AUCTION At length the never to be forgotten day of the terrible auction arrived when the 'slaves horses and other cattle' of Charles Ardinburgh deceased were to be put under the hammer and again change masters Not only Isabella and Peter but their mother was now destined to the auction block and would have been struck off with the rest to the highest bidder but for the following circumstance A question arose among the heirs 'Who shall be burthened with Bomefree when we have sent away his faithful Mau mau Bett ' He was becoming weak and infirm his limbs were painfully rheumatic and distorted more from exposure and hardship than from old age though he was several years older than Mau mau Bett he was no longer considered of value but must soon be a burthen and a care to some one After some contention on the point at issue none being willing to be burthened with him it was finally agreed as most expedient for the heirs that the price of Mau mau Bett should be sacrificed and she receive her freedom on condition that she take care of and support her faithful James faithful not only to her as a husband but proverbially faithful as a slave to those who would not willingly sacrifice a dollar for his comfort now that he had commenced his descent into the dark vale of decrepitude and suffering This important decision was received as joyful news indeed to our ancient couple who were the objects of it and who were trying to prepare their hearts for a severe struggle and one altogether new to them as they had never before been separated for though ignorant helpless crushed in spirit and weighed down with hardship and cruel bereavement they were still human and their human hearts beat within them with as true an affection as ever caused a human heart to beat And their anticipated separation now in the decline of life after the last child had been torn from them must have been truly appalling Another privilege was granted them that of remaining occupants of the same dark humid cellar I have before described otherwise they were to support themselves as they best could And as her mother was still able to do considerable work and her father a little they got on for some time very comfortably The strangers who rented the house were humane people and very kind to them they were not rich and owned no slaves How long this state of things continued we are unable to say as Isabella had not then sufficiently cultivated her organ of time to calculate years or even weeks or hours But she thinks her mother must have lived several years after the death of Master Charles She remembers going to visit her parents some three or four times before the death of her mother and a good deal of time seemed to her to intervene between each visit At length her mother's health began to decline a fever sore made its ravages on one of her limbs and the palsy began to shake her frame still she and James tottered about picking up a little here and there which added to the mites contributed by their kind neighbors sufficed to sustain life and drive famine from the door DEATH OF MAU MAU BETT One morning in early autumn from the reason above mentioned we cannot tell what year Mau mau Bett told James she would make him a loaf of rye bread and get Mrs Simmons their kind neighbor to bake it for them as she would bake that forenoon James told her he had engaged to rake after the cart for his neighbors that morning but before he commenced he would pole off some apples from a tree near which they were allowed to gather and if she could get some of them baked with the bread it would give it a nice relish for their dinner He beat off the apples and soon after saw Mau mau Bett come out and gather them up At the blowing of the horn for dinner he groped his way into his cellar anticipating his humble but warm and nourishing meal when lo instead of being cheered by the sight and odor of fresh baked bread and the savory apples his cellar seemed more cheerless than usual and at first neither sight nor sound met eye or ear But on groping his way through the room his staff which he used as a pioneer to go before and warn him of danger seemed to be impeded in its progress and a low gurgling choaking sound proceeded from the object before him giving him the first intimation of the truth as it was that Mau mau Bett his bosom companion the only remaining member of his large family had fallen in a fit of the palsy and lay helpless and senseless on the earth Who among us located in pleasant homes surrounded with every comfort and so many kind and sympathizing friends can picture to ourselves the dark and desolate state of poor old James penniless weak lame and nearly blind as he was at the moment he found his companion was removed from him and he was left alone in the world with no one to aid comfort or console him for she never revived again and lived only a few hours after being discovered senseless by her poor bereaved James LAST DAYS OF BOMEFREE Isabella and Peter were permitted to see the remains of their mother laid in their last narrow dwelling and to make their bereaved father a little visit ere they returned to their servitude And most piteous were the lamentations of the poor old man when at last they also were obliged to bid him 'Farewell ' Juan Fernandes on his desolate island was not so pitiable an object as this poor lame man Blind and crippled he was too superannuated to think for a moment of taking care of himself and he greatly feared no persons would interest themselves in his behalf 'Oh ' he would exclaim 'I had thought God would take me first Mau mau was so much smarter than I and could get about and take care of herself and I am so old and so helpless What is to become of me I can't do any thing more my children are all gone and here I am left helpless and alone ' 'And then as I was taking leave of him ' said his daughter in relating it 'he raised his voice and cried aloud like a child Oh how he DID cry I HEAR it now and remember it as well as if it were but yesterday poor old man He thought God had done it all and my heart bled within me at the sight of his misery He begged me to get permission to come and see him sometimes which I readily and heartily promised him ' But when all had left him the Ardinburghs having some feeling left for their faithful and favorite slave 'took turns about' in keeping him permitting him to stay a few weeks at one house and then awhile at another and so around If when he made a removal the place where he was going was not too far off he took up his line of march staff in hand and asked for no assistance If it was twelve or twenty miles they gave him a ride While he was living in this way Isabella was twice permitted to visit him Another time she walked twelve miles and carried her infant in her arms to see him but when she reached the place where she hoped to find him he had just left for a place some twenty miles distant and she never saw him more The last time she did see him she found him seated on a rock by the road side alone and far from any house He was then migrating from the house of one Ardinburgh to that of another several miles distant His hair was white like wool he was almost blind and his gait was more a creep than a walk but the weather was warm and pleasant and he did not dislike the journey When Isabella addressed him he recognized her voice and was exceeding glad to see her He was assisted to mount the wagon was carried back to the famous cellar of which we have spoken and there they held their last earthly conversation He again as usual bewailed his loneliness spoke in tones of anguish of his many children saying 'They are all taken away from me I have now not one to give me a cup of cold water why should I live and not die ' Isabella whose heart yearned over her father and who would have made any sacrifice to have been able to be with and take care of him tried to comfort by telling him that 'she had heard the white folks say that all the slaves in the State would be freed in ten years and that then she would come and take care of him ' 'I would take just as good care of you as Mau mau would if she was here' continued Isabel 'Oh my child ' replied he 'I cannot live that long ' 'Oh do daddy do live and I will take such good care of you ' was her rejoinder She now says 'Why I thought then in my ignorance that he could live if he would I just as much thought so as I ever thought any thing in my life and I insisted on his living but he shook his head and insisted he could not ' But before Bomefree's good constitution would yield either to age exposure or a strong desire to die the Ardinburghs again tired of him and offered freedom to two old slaves Caesar brother of Mau mau Bett and his wife Betsey on condition that they should take care of James I was about to say 'their brother in law' but as slaves are neither husbands nor wives in law the idea of their being brothers in law is truly ludicrous And although they were too old and infirm to take care of themselves C sar having been afflicted for a long time with fever sores and his wife with the jaundice they eagerly accepted the boon of freedom which had been the life long desire of their souls though at a time when emancipation was to them little more than destitution and was a freedom more to be desired by the master than the slave Sojourner declares of the slaves in their ignorance that 'their thoughts are no longer than her finger ' DEATH OF BOMEFREE A rude cabin in a lone wood far from any neighbors was granted to our freed friends as the only assistance they were now to expect Bomefree from this time found his poor needs hardly supplied as his new providers were scarce able to administer to their own wants However the time drew near when things were to be decidedly worse rather than better for they had not been together long before Betty died and shortly after C sar followed her to 'that bourne from whence no traveller returns' leaving poor James again desolate and more helpless than ever before as this time there was no kind family in the house and the Ardinburghs no longer invited him to their homes Yet lone blind and helpless as he was James for a time lived on One day an aged colored woman named Soan called at his shanty and James besought her in the most moving manner even with tears to tarry awhile and wash and mend him up so that he might once more be decent and comfortable for he was suffering dreadfully with the filth and vermin that had collected upon him Soan was herself an emancipated slave old and weak with no one to care for her and she lacked the courage to undertake a job of such seeming magnitude fearing she might herself get sick and perish there without assistance and with great reluctance and a heart swelling with pity as she afterwards declared she felt obliged to leave him in his wretchedness and filth And shortly after her visit this faithful slave this deserted wreck of humanity was found on his miserable pallet frozen and stiff in death The kind angel had come at last and relieved him of the many miseries that his fellow man had heaped upon him Yes he had died chilled and starved with none to speak a kindly word or do a kindly deed for him in that last dread hour of need The news of his death reached the ears of John Ardinburgh a grandson of the old Colonel and he declared that 'Bomefree who had ever been a kind and faithful slave should now have a good funeral ' And now gentle reader what think you constituted a good funeral Answer some black paint for the coffin and a jug of ardent spirits What a compensation for a life of toil of patient submission to repeated robberies of the most aggravated kind and also far more than murderous neglect Mankind often vainly attempt to atone for unkindness or cruelty to the living by honoring the same after death but John Ardinburgh undoubtedly meant his pot of paint and jug of whisky should act as an opiate on his slaves rather than on his own seared conscience COMMENCEMENT OF ISABELLA'S TRIALS IN LIFE Having seen the sad end of her parents so far as it relates to this earthly life we will return with Isabella to that memorable auction which threatened to separate her father and mother A slave auction is a terrible affair to its victims and its incidents and consequences are graven on their hearts as with a pen of burning steel At this memorable time Isabella was struck off for the sum of one hundred dollars to one John Nealy of Ulster County New York and she has an impression that in this sale she was connected with a lot of sheep She was now nine years of age and her trials in life may be dated from this period She says with emphasis 'Now the war begun ' She could only talk Dutch and the Nealy's could only talk English Mr Nealy could understand Dutch but Isabel and her mistress could neither of them understand the language of the other and this of itself was a formidable obstacle in the way of a good understanding between them and for some time was a fruitful source of dissatisfaction to the mistress and of punishment and suffering to Isabella She says 'If they sent me for a frying pan not knowing what they meant perhaps I carried them the pot hooks and trammels Then oh how angry mistress would be with me ' Then she suffered 'terribly terribly ' with the cold During the winter her feet were badly frozen for want of proper covering They gave her a plenty to eat and also a plenty of whippings One Sunday morning in particular she was told to go to the barn on going there she found her master with a bundle of rods prepared in the embers and bound together with cords When he had tied her hands together before her he gave her the most cruel whipping she was ever tortured with He whipped her till the flesh was deeply lacerated and the blood streamed from her wounds and the scars remain to the present day to testify to the fact 'And now ' she says 'when I hear 'em tell of whipping women on the bare flesh it makes my flesh crawl and my very hair rise on my head Oh my God ' she continues 'what a way is this of treating human beings ' In these hours of her extremity she did not forget the instructions of her mother to go to God in all her trials and every affliction and she not only remembered but obeyed going to him 'and telling him all and asking him if he thought it was right ' and begging him to protect and shield her from her persecutors She always asked with an unwavering faith that she should receive just what she plead for 'And now ' she says 'though it seems curious I do not remember ever asking for any thing but what I got it And I always received it as an answer to my prayers When I got beaten I never knew it long enough beforehand to pray and I always thought if I only had had time to pray to God for help I should have escaped the beating ' She had no idea God had any knowledge of her thoughts save what she told him or heard her prayers unless they were spoken audibly And consequently she could not pray unless she had time and opportunity to go by herself where she could talk to God without being overheard TRIALS CONTINUED When she had been at Mr Nealy's several months she began to beg God most earnestly to send her father to her and as soon as she commenced to pray she began as confidently to look for his coming and ere it was long to her great joy he came She had no opportunity to speak to him of the troubles that weighed so heavily on her spirit while he remained but when he left she followed him to the gate and unburdened her heart to him inquiring if he could not do something to get her a new and better place In this way the slaves often assist each other by ascertaining who are kind to their slaves comparatively and then using their influence to get such an one to hire or buy their friends and masters often from policy as well as from latent humanity allow those they are about to sell or let to choose their own places if the persons they happen to select for masters are considered safe pay He promised to do all he could and they parted But every day as long as the snow lasted for there was snow on the ground at the time she returned to the spot where they separated and walking in the tracks her father had made in the snow repeated her prayer that 'God would help her father get her a new and better place ' A long time had not elapsed when a fisherman by the name of Scriver appeared at Mr Nealy's and inquired of Isabel 'if she would like to go and live with him ' She eagerly answered 'Yes ' nothing doubting but he was sent in answer to her prayer and she soon started off with him walking while he rode for he had bought her at the suggestion of her father paying one hundred and five dollars for her He also lived in Ulster County but some five or six miles from Mr Nealy's Scriver besides being a fisherman kept a tavern for the accommodation of people of his own class for his was a rude uneducated family exceedingly profane in their language but on the whole an honest kind and well disposed people They owned a large farm but left it wholly unimproved attending mainly to their vocations of fishing and inn keeping Isabella declares she can ill describe the life she led with them It was a wild out of door kind of life She was expected to carry fish to hoe corn to bring roots and herbs from the wood for beers go to the Strand for a gallon of molasses or liquor as the case might require and 'browse around ' as she expresses it It was a life that suited her well for the time being as devoid of hardship or terror as it was of improvement a need which had not yet become a want Instead of improving at this place morally she retrograded as their example taught her to curse and it was here that she took her first oath After living with them about a year and a half she was sold to one John J Dumont for the sum of seventy pounds This was in Mr Dumont lived in the same county as her former masters in the town of New Paltz and she remained with him till a short time previous to her emancipation by the State in HER STANDING WITH HER NEW MASTER AND MISTRESS Had Mrs Dumont possessed that vein of kindness and consideration for the slaves so perceptible in her husband's character Isabella would have been as comfortable here as one had best be if one must be a slave Mr Dumont had been nursed in the very lap of slavery and being naturally a man of kind feelings treated his slaves with all the consideration he did his other animals and more perhaps But Mrs Dumont who had been born and educated in a non slaveholding family and like many others used only to work people who under the most stimulating of human motives were willing to put forth their every energy could not have patience with the creeping gait the dull understanding or see any cause for the listless manners and careless slovenly habits of the poor down trodden outcast entirely forgetting that every high and efficient motive had been removed far from him and that had not his very intellect been crushed out of him the slave would find little ground for aught but hopeless despondency From this source arose a long series of trials in the life of our heroine which we must pass over in silence some from motives of delicacy and others because the relation of them might inflict undeserved pain on some now living whom Isabel remembers only with esteem and love therefore the reader will not be surprised if our narrative appear somewhat tame at this point and may rest assured that it is not for want of facts as the most thrilling incidents of this portion of her life are from various motives suppressed One comparatively trifling incident she wishes related as it made a deep impression on her mind at the time showing as she thinks how God shields the innocent and causes them to triumph over their enemies and also how she stood between master and mistress In her family Mrs Dumont employed two white girls one of whom named Kate evinced a disposition to 'lord it over' Isabel and in her emphatic language 'to grind her down ' Her master often shielded her from the attacks and accusations of others praising her for her readiness and ability to work and these praises seemed to foster a spirit of hostility to her in the minds of Mrs Dumont and her white servant the latter of whom took every opportunity to cry up her faults lessen her in the esteem of her master and increase against her the displeasure of her mistress which was already more than sufficient for Isabel's comfort Her master insisted that she could do as much work as half a dozen common people and do it well too whilst her mistress insisted that the first was true only because it ever came from her hand but half performed A good deal of feeling arose from this difference of opinion which was getting to rather an uncomfortable height when all at once the potatoes that Isabel cooked for breakfast assumed a dingy dirty look Her mistress blamed her severely asking her master to observe 'a fine specimen of Bell's work ' adding 'it is the way all her work is done ' Her master scolded also this time and commanded her to be more careful in future Kate joined with zest in the censures and was very hard upon her Isabella thought that she had done all she well could to have them nice and became quite distressed at these appearances and wondered what she should do to avoid them In this dilemma Gertrude Dumont Mr D 's eldest child a good kind hearted girl of ten years who pitied Isabel sincerely when she heard them all blame her so unsparingly came forward offering her sympathy and assistance and when about to retire to bed on the night of Isabella's humiliation she advanced to Isabel and told her if she would wake her early next morning she would get up and attend to her potatoes for her while she Isabella went to milking and they would see if they could not have them nice and not have 'Poppee ' her word for father and 'Matty ' her word for mother and all of 'em scolding so terribly Isabella gladly availed herself of this kindness which touched her to the heart amid so much of an opposite spirit When Isabella had put the potatoes over to boil Getty told her she would herself tend the fire while Isabel milked She had not long been seated by the fire in performance of her promise when Kate entered and requested Gertrude to go out of the room and do something for her which she refused still keeping her place in the corner While there Kate came sweeping about the fire caught up a chip lifted some ashes with it and dashed them into the kettle Now the mystery was solved the plot discovered Kate was working a little too fast at making her mistress's words good at showing that Mrs Dumont and herself were on the right side of the dispute and consequently at gaining power over Isabella Yes she was quite too fast inasmuch as she had overlooked the little figure of justice which sat in the corner with scales nicely balanced waiting to give all their dues But the time had come when she was to be overlooked no longer It was Getty's turn to speak now 'Oh Poppee oh Poppee ' said she 'Kate has been putting ashes in among the potatoes I saw her do it Look at those that fell on the outside of the kettle You can now see what made the potatoes so dingy every morning though Bell washed them clean ' And she repeated her story to every new comer till the fraud was made as public as the censure of Isabella had been Her mistress looked blank and remained dumb her master muttered something which sounded very like an oath and poor Kate was so chop fallen she looked like a convicted criminal who would gladly have hid herself now that the baseness was out to conceal her mortified pride and deep chagrin It was a fine triumph for Isabella and her master and she became more ambitious than ever to please him and he stimulated her ambition by his commendation and by boasting of her to his friends telling them that 'that wench' pointing to Isabel is better to me than a man for she will do a good family's washing in the night and be ready in the morning to go into the field where she will do as much at raking and binding as my best hands ' Her ambition and desire to please were so great that she often worked several nights in succession sleeping only short snatches as she sat in her chair and some nights she would not allow herself to take any sleep save what she could get resting herself against the wall fearing that if she sat down she would sleep too long These extra exertions to please and the praises consequent upon them brought upon her head the envy of her fellow slaves and they taunted her with being the 'white folks' nigger ' On the other hand she received a larger share of the confidence of her master and many small favors that were by them unattainable I asked her if her master Dumont ever whipped her She answered 'Oh yes he sometimes whipped me soundly though never cruelly And the most severe whipping he ever give me was because I was cruel to a cat 'At this time she looked upon her master as a God and believed that he knew of and could see her at all times even as God himself And she used sometimes to confess her delinquencies from the conviction that he already knew them and that she should fare better if she confessed voluntarily and if any one talked to her of the injustice of her being a slave she answered them with contempt and immediately told her master She then firmly believed that slavery was right and honorable Yet she now sees very clearly the false position they were all in both masters and slaves and she looks back with utter astonishment at the absurdity of the claims so arrogantly set up by the masters over beings designed by God to be as free as kings and at the perfect stupidity of the slave in admitting for one moment the validity of these claims In obedience to her mother's instructions she had educated herself to such a sense of honesty that when she had become a mother she would sometimes whip her child when it cried to her for bread rather than give it a piece secretly lest it should learn to take what was not its own And the writer of this knows from personal observation that the slaveholders of the South feel it to be a religious duty to teach their slaves to be honest and never to take what is not their own Oh consistency art thou not a jewel Yet Isabella glories in the fact that she was faithful and true to her master she says 'It made me true to my God' meaning that it helped to form in her a character that loved truth and hated a lie and had saved her from the bitter pains and fears that are sure to follow in the wake of insincerity and hypocrisy As she advanced in years an attachment sprung up between herself and a slave named Robert But his master an Englishman by the name of Catlin anxious that no one's property but his own should be enhanced by the increase of his slaves forbade Robert's visits to Isabella and commanded him to take a wife among his fellow servants Notwithstanding this interdiction Robert following the bent of his inclinations continued his visits to Isabel though very stealthily and as he believed without exciting the suspicion of his master but one Saturday afternoon hearing that Bell was ill he took the liberty to go and see her The first intimation she had of his visit was the appearance of her master inquiring 'if she had seen Bob ' On her answering in the negative he said to her 'If you see him tell him to take care of himself for the Catlins are after him ' Almost at that instant Bob made his appearance and the first people he met were his old and his young masters They were terribly enraged at finding him there and the eldest began cursing and calling upon his son to 'Knock down the d d black rascal ' at the same time they both fell upon him like tigers beating him with the heavy ends of their canes bruising and mangling his head and face in the most awful manner and causing the blood which streamed from his wounds to cover him like a slaughtered beast constituting him a most shocking spectacle Mr Dumont interposed at this point telling the ruffians they could no longer thus spill human blood on his premises he would have 'no niggers killed there ' The Catlins then took a rope they had taken with them for the purpose and tied Bob's hands behind him in such a manner that Mr Dumont insisted on loosening the cord declaring that no brute should be tied in that manner where he was And as they led him away like the greatest of criminals the more humane Dumont followed them to their homes as Robert's protector and when he returned he kindly went to Bell as he called her telling her he did not think they would strike him any more as their wrath had greatly cooled before he left them Isabella had witnessed this scene from her window and was greatly shocked at the murderous treatment of poor Robert whom she truly loved and whose only crime in the eye of his persecutors was his affection for her This beating and we know not what after treatment completely subdued the spirit of its victim for Robert ventured no more to visit Isabella but like an obedient and faithful chattel took himself a wife from the house of his master Robert did not live many years after his last visit to Isabel but took his departure to that country where 'they neither marry nor are given in marriage ' and where the oppressor cannot molest ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE Subsequently Isabella was married to a fellow slave named Thomas who had previously had two wives one of whom if not both had been torn from him and sold far away And it is more than probable that he was not only allowed but encouraged to take another at each successive sale I say it is probable because the writer of this knows from personal observation that such is the custom among slaveholders at the present day and that in a twenty months' residence among them we never knew any one to open the lip against the practice and when we severely censured it the slaveholder had nothing to say and the slave pleaded that under existing circumstances he could do no better Such an abominable state of things is silently tolerated to say the least by slaveholders deny it who may And what is that religion that sanctions even by its silence all that is embraced in the 'Peculiar Institution ' If there can be any thing more diametrically opposed to the religion of Jesus than the working of this soul killing system which is as truly sanctioned by the religion of America as are her ministers and churches we wish to be shown where it can be found We have said Isabella was married to Thomas she was after the fashion of slavery one of the slaves performing the ceremony for them as no true minister of Christ can perform as in the presence of God what he knows to be a mere farce a mock marriage unrecognized by any civil law and liable to be annulled any moment when the interest or caprice of the master should dictate With what feelings must slaveholders expect us to listen to their horror of amalgamation in prospect while they are well aware that we know how calmly and quietly they contemplate the present state of licentiousness their own wicked laws have created not only as it regards the slave but as it regards the more privileged portion of the population of the South Slaveholders appear to me to take the same notice of the vices of the slave as one does of the vicious disposition of his horse They are often an inconvenience further than that they care not to trouble themselves about the matter ISABELLA AS A MOTHER In process of time Isabella found herself the mother of five children and she rejoiced in being permitted to be the instrument of increasing the property of her oppressors Think dear reader without a blush if you can for one moment of a mother thus willingly and with pride laying her own children the 'flesh of her flesh ' on the altar of slavery a sacrifice to the bloody Moloch But we must remember that beings capable of such sacrifices are not mothers they are only 'things ' 'chattels ' 'property ' But since that time the subject of this narrative has made some advances from a state of chattelism towards that of a woman and a mother and she now looks back upon her thoughts and feelings there in her state of ignorance and degradation as one does on the dark imagery of a fitful dream One moment it seems but a frightful illusion again it appears a terrible reality I would to God it were but a dreamy myth and not as it now stands a horrid reality to some three millions of chattelized human beings I have already alluded to her care not to teach her children to steal by her example and she says with groanings that cannot be written 'The Lord only knows how many times I let my children go hungry rather than take secretly the bread I liked not to ask for ' All parents who annul their preceptive teachings by their daily practices would do well to profit by her example Another proof of her master's kindness of heart is found in the following fact If her master came into the house and found her infant crying as she could not always attend to its wants and the commands of her mistress at the same time he would turn to his wife with a look of reproof and ask her why she did not see the child taken care of saying most earnestly 'I will not hear this crying I can't bear it and I will not hear any child cry so Here Bell take care of this child if no more work is done for a week ' And he would linger to see if his orders were obeyed and not countermanded When Isabella went to the field to work she used to put her infant in a basket tying a rope to each handle and suspending the basket to a branch of a tree set another small child to swing it It was thus secure from reptiles and was easily administered to and even lulled to sleep by a child too young for other labors I was quite struck with the ingenuity of such a baby tender as I have sometimes been with the swinging hammock the native mother prepares for her sick infant apparently so much easier than aught we have in our more civilized homes easier for the child because it gets the motion without the least jar and easier for the nurse because the hammock is strung so high as to supersede the necessity of stooping SLAVEHOLDER'S PROMISES After emancipation had been decreed by the State some years before the time fixed for its consummation Isabella's master told her if she would do well and be faithful he would give her 'free papers ' one year before she was legally free by statute In the year she had a badly diseased hand which greatly diminished her usefulness but on the arrival of July the time specified for her receiving her 'free papers ' she claimed the fulfilment of her master's promise but he refused granting it on account as he alleged of the loss he had sustained by her hand She plead that she had worked all the time and done many things she was not wholly able to do although she knew she had been less useful than formerly but her master remained inflexible Her very faithfulness probably operated against her now and he found it less easy than he thought to give up the profits of his faithful Bell who had so long done him efficient service But Isabella inwardly determined that she would remain quietly with him only until she had spun his wool about one hundred pounds and then she would leave him taking the rest of the time to herself 'Ah ' she says with emphasis that cannot be written 'the slaveholders are TERRIBLE for promising to give you this or that or such and such a privilege if you will do thus and so and when the time of fulfilment comes and one claims the promise they forsooth recollect nothing of the kind and you are like as not taunted with being a LIAR or at best the slave is accused of not having performed his part or condition of the contract ' 'Oh ' said she 'I have felt as if I could not live through the operation sometimes Just think of us so eager for our pleasures and just foolish enough to keep feeding and feeding ourselves up with the idea that we should get what had been thus fairly promised and when we think it is almost in our hands find ourselves flatly denied Just think how could we bear it Why there was Charles Brodhead promised his slave Ned that when harvesting was over he might go and see his wife who lived some twenty or thirty miles off So Ned worked early and late and as soon as the harvest was all in he claimed the promised boon His master said he had merely told him he 'would see if he could go when the harvest was over but now he saw that he could not go ' But Ned who still claimed a positive promise on which he had fully depended went on cleaning his shoes His master asked him if he intended going and on his replying 'yes ' took up a sled stick that lay near him and gave him such a blow on the head as broke his skull killing him dead on the spot The poor colored people all felt struck down by the blow ' Ah and well they might Yet it was but one of a long series of bloody and other most effectual blows struck against their liberty and their lives Yet no official notice was taken of this more than brutal murder But to return from our digression The subject of this narrative was to have been free July but she continued with her master till the wool was spun and the heaviest of the 'fall's work' closed up when she concluded to take her freedom into her own hands and seek her fortune in some other place HER ESCAPE The question in her mind and one not easily solved now was 'How can I get away ' So as was her usual custom she 'told God she was afraid to go in the night and in the day every body would see her ' At length the thought came to her that she could leave just before the day dawned and get out of the neighborhood where she was known before the people were much astir 'Yes ' said she fervently 'that's a good thought Thank you God for that thought ' So receiving it as coming direct from God she acted upon it and one fine morning a little before day break she might have been seen stepping stealthily away from the rear of Master Dumont's house her infant on one arm and her wardrobe on the other the bulk and weight of which probably she never found so convenient as on the present occasion a cotton handkerchief containing both her clothes and her provisions As she gained the summit of a high hill a considerable distance from her master's the sun offended her by coming forth in all his pristine splendor She thought it never was so light before indeed she thought it much too light She stopped to look about her and ascertain if her pursuers were yet in sight No one appeared and for the first time the question came up for settlement 'Where and to whom shall I go ' In all her thoughts of getting away she had not once asked herself whither she should direct her steps She sat down fed her infant and again turning her thoughts to God her only help she prayed him to direct her to some safe asylum And soon it occurred to her that there was a man living somewhere in the direction she had been pursuing by the name of Levi Rowe whom she had known and who she thought would be likely to befriend her She accordingly pursued her way to his house where she found him ready to entertain and assist her though he was then on his death bed He bade her partake of the hospitalities of his house said he knew of two good places where she might get in and requested his wife to show her where they were to be found As soon as she came in sight of the first house she recollected having seen it and its inhabitants before and instantly exclaimed 'That's the place for me I shall stop there ' She went there and found the good people of the house Mr and Mrs Van Wagener absent but was kindly received and hospitably entertained by their excellent mother till the return of her children When they arrived she made her case known to them They listened to her story assuring her they never turned the needy away and willingly gave her employment She had not been there long before her old master Dumont appeared as she had anticipated for when she took French leave of him she resolved not to go too far from him and not put him to as much trouble in looking her up for the latter he was sure to do as Tom and Jack had done when they ran away from him a short time before This was very considerate in her to say the least and a proof that 'like begets like ' He had often considered her feelings though not always and she was equally considerate When her master saw her he said 'Well Bell so you've run away from me ' 'No I did not run away I walked away by day light and all because you had promised me a year of my time ' His reply was 'You must go back with me ' Her decisive answer was 'No I won't go back with you ' He said 'Well I shall take the child ' This also was as stoutly negatived Mr Isaac S Van Wagener then interposed saying he had never been in the practice of buying and selling slaves he did not believe in slavery but rather than have Isabella taken back by force he would buy her services for the balance of the year for which her master charged twenty dollars and five in addition for the child The sum was paid and her master Dumont departed but not till he had heard Mr Van Wagener tell her not to call him master adding 'there is but one master and he who is your master is my master ' Isabella inquired what she should call him He answered 'Call me Isaac Van Wagener and my wife is Maria Van Wagener ' Isabella could not understand this and thought it a mighty change as it most truly was from a master whose word was law to simple Isaac S Van Wagener who was master to no one With these noble people who though they could not be the masters of slaves were undoubtedly a portion of God's nobility she resided one year and from them she derived the name of Van Wagener he being her last master in the eye of the law and a slave's surname is ever the same as his master that is if he is allowed to have any other name than Tom Jack or Guffin Slaves have sometimes been severely punished for adding their master's name to their own But when they have no particular title to it it is no particular offence ILLEGAL SALE OF HER SON A little previous to Isabel's leaving her old master he had sold her child a boy of five years to a Dr Gedney who took him with him as far as New York city on his way to England but finding the boy too small for his service he sent him back to his brother Solomon Gedney This man disposed of him to his sister's husband a wealthy planter by the name of Fowler who took him to his own home in Alabama This illegal and fraudulent transaction had been perpetrated some months before Isabella knew of it as she was now living at Mr Van Wagener's The law expressly prohibited the sale of any slave out of the State and all minors were to be free at twenty one years of age and Mr Dumont had sold Peter with the express understanding that he was soon to return to the State of New York and be emancipated at the specified time When Isabel heard that her son had been sold South she immediately started on foot and alone to find the man who had thus dared in the face of all law human and divine to sell her child out of the State and if possible to bring him to account for the deed Arriving at New Paltz she went directly to her former mistress Dumont complaining bitterly of the removal of her son Her mistress heard her through and then replied 'Ugh a fine fuss to make about a little nigger Why have n't you as many of 'em left as you can see to and take care of A pity 'tis the niggers are not all in Guinea Making such a halloo balloo about the neighborhood and all for a paltry nigger ' Isabella heard her through and after a moment's hesitation answered in tones of deep determination 'I'll have my child again ' 'Have your child again ' repeated her mistress her tones big with contempt and scorning the absurd idea of her getting him 'How can you get him And what have you to support him with if you could Have you any money ' 'No ' answered Bell 'I have no money but God has enough or what's better And I'll have my child again ' These words were pronounced in the most slow solemn and determined measure and manner And in speaking of it she says 'Oh my God I know'd I'd have him agin I was sure God would help me to get him Why I felt so tall within I felt as if the power of a nation was with me ' The impressions made by Isabella on her auditors when moved by lofty or deep feeling can never be transmitted to paper to use the words of another till by some Daguerrian act we are enabled to transfer the look the gesture the tones of voice in connection with the quaint yet fit expressions used and the spirit stirring animation that at such a time pervades all she says After leaving her mistress she called on Mrs Gedney mother of him who had sold her boy who after listening to her lamentations her grief being mingled with indignation at the sale of her son and her declaration that she would have him again said 'Dear me What a disturbance to make about your child What is your child better than my child My child is gone out there and yours is gone to live with her to have enough of every thing and to be treated like a gentleman ' And here she laughed at Isabel's absurd fears as she would represent them to be 'Yes ' said Isabel 'your child has gone there but she is married and my boy has gone as a slave and he is too little to go so far from his mother Oh I must have my child ' And here the continued laugh of Mrs G seemed to Isabel in this time of anguish and distress almost demoniacal And well it was for Mrs Gedney that at that time she could not even dream of the awful fate awaiting her own beloved daughter at the hands of him whom she had chosen as worthy the wealth of her love and confidence and in whose society her young heart had calculated on a happiness purer and more elevated than was ever conferred by a kingly crown But alas she was doomed to disappointment as we shall relate by and by At this point Isabella earnestly begged of God that he would show those about her that he was her helper and she adds in narrating 'And he did or if he did not show them he did me ' IT IS OFTEN DARKEST JUST BEFORE DAWN This homely proverb was illustrated in the case of our sufferer for at the period at which we have arrived in our narrative to her the darkness seemed palpable and the waters of affliction covered her soul yet light was about to break in upon her Soon after the scenes related in our last which had harrowed up her very soul to agony she met a man we would like to tell you who dear reader but it would be doing him no kindness even at the present day to do so who evidently sympathized with her and counselled her to go to the Quakers telling her they were already feeling very indignant at the fraudulent sale of her son and assuring that they would readily assist her and direct her what to do He pointed out to her two houses where lived some of those people who formerly more than any other sect perhaps lived out the principles of the gospel of Christ She wended her way to their dwellings was listened to unknown as she personally was to them with patience and soon gained their sympathies and active cooperation They gave her lodgings for the night and it is very amusing to hear her tell of the 'nice high clean white beautiful bed' assigned her to sleep in which contrasted so strangely with her former pallets that she sat down and contemplated it perfectly absorbed in wonder that such a bed should have been appropriated to one like herself For some time she thought that she would lie down beneath it on her usual bedstead the floor 'I did indeed ' says she laughing heartily at her former self However she finally concluded to make use of the bed for fear that not to do so might injure the feelings of her good hostess In the morning the Quaker saw that she was taken and set down near Kingston with directions to go to the Court House and enter complaint to the grand jury By a little inquiry she found which was the building she sought went into the door and taking the first man she saw of imposing appearance for the grand jury she commenced her complaint But he very civilly informed her there was no grand jury there she must go up stairs When she had with some difficulty ascended the flight through the crowd that filled them she again turned to the 'grandest' looking man she could select telling him she had come to enter a complaint to the grand jury For his own amusement he inquired what her complaint was but when he saw it was a serious matter he said to her 'This is no place to enter a complaint go in there ' pointing in a particular direction She then went in where she found the Grand Jurors indeed sitting and again commenced to relate her injuries After holding some conversation among themselves one of them rose and bidding her follow him led the way to a side office where he heard her story and asked her 'if she could swear that the child she spoke of was her son ' 'Yes ' she answered 'I swear it's my son ' 'Stop stop ' said the lawyer 'you must swear by this book' giving her a book which she thinks must have been the Bible She took it and putting it to her lips began again to swear it was her child The clerks unable to preserve their gravity any longer burst into an uproarious laugh and one of them inquired of lawyer Chip of what use it could be to make her swear 'It will answer the law ' replied the officer He then made her comprehend just what he wished her to do and she took a lawful oath as far as the outward ceremony could make it one All can judge how far she understood its spirit and meaning He now gave her a writ directing her to take it to the constable of New Paltz and have him serve it on Solomon Gedney She obeyed walking or rather trotting in her haste some eight or nine miles But while the constable through mistake served the writ on a brother of the real culprit Solomon Gedney slipped into a boat and was nearly across the North River on whose banks they were standing before the dull Dutch constable was aware of his mistake Solomon Gedney meanwhile consulted a lawyer who advised him to go to Alabama and bring back the boy otherwise it might cost him fourteen years' imprisonment and a thousand dollars in cash By this time it is hoped he began to feel that selling slaves unlawfully was not so good a business as he had wished to find it He secreted himself till preparations could be made and soon set sail for Alabama Steamboats and railroads had not then annihilated distance to the extent they now have and although he left in the fall of the year spring came ere he returned bringing the boy with him but holding on to him as his property It had ever been Isabella's prayer not only that her son might be returned but that he should be delivered from bondage and into her own hands lest he should be punished out of mere spite to her who was so greatly annoying and irritating to her oppressors and if her suit was gained her very triumph would add vastly to their irritation She again sought advice of Esquire Chip whose counsel was that the aforesaid constable serve the before mentioned writ upon the right person This being done soon brought Solomon Gedney up to Kingston where he gave bonds for his appearance at court in the sum of Esquire Chip next informed his client that her case must now lie over till the next session of the court some months in the future 'The law must take its course ' said he 'What wait another court wait months ' said the persevering mother 'Why long before that time he can go clear off and take my child with him no one knows where I cannot wait I must have him now whilst he is to be had ' 'Well ' said the lawyer very coolly 'if he puts the boy out of the way he must pay the one half of which will be yours ' supposing perhaps that would pay for a 'heap of children ' in the eye of a slave who never in all her life called a dollar her own But in this instance he was mistaken in his reckoning She assured him that she had not been seeking money neither would money satisfy her it was her son and her son alone she wanted and her son she must have Neither could she wait court not she The lawyer used his every argument to convince her that she ought to be very thankful for what they had done for her that it was a great deal and it was but reasonable that she should now wait patiently the time of the court Yet she never felt for a moment like being influenced by these suggestions She felt confident she was to receive a full and literal answer to her prayer the burden of which had been 'O Lord give my son into my hands and that speedily Let not the spoilers have him any longer ' Notwithstanding she very distinctly saw that those who had thus far helped her on so kindly were wearied of her and she feared God was wearied also She had a short time previous learned that Jesus was a Savior and an intercessor and she thought that if Jesus could but be induced to plead for her in the present trial God would listen to him though he were wearied of her importunities To him of course she applied As she was walking about scarcely knowing whither she went asking within herself 'Who will show me any good and lend a helping hand in this matter ' she was accosted by a perfect stranger and one whose name she has never learned in the following terms 'Halloo there how do you get along with your boy do they give him up to you ' She told him all adding that now every body was tired and she had none to help her He said 'Look here I'll tell you what you'd better do Do you see that stone house yonder ' pointing in a particular direction 'Well lawyer Demain lives there and do you go to him and lay your case before him I think he'll help you Stick to him Don't give him peace till he does I feel sure if you press him he'll do it for you ' She needed no further urging but trotted off at her peculiar gait in the direction of his house as fast as possible and she was not encumbered with stockings shoes or any other heavy article of dress When she had told him her story in her impassioned manner he looked at her a few moments as if to ascertain if he were contemplating a new variety of the genus homo and then told her if she would give him five dollars he would get her son for her in twenty four hours 'Why ' she replied 'I have no money and never had a dollar in my life ' Said he 'If you will go to those Quakers in Poppletown who carried you to court they will help you to five dollars in cash I have no doubt and you shall have your son in twenty four hours from the time you bring me that sum ' She performed the journey to Poppletown a distance of some ten miles very expeditiously collected considerable more than the sum specified by the barrister then shutting the money tightly in her hand she trotted back and paid the lawyer a larger fee than he had demanded When inquired of by people what she had done with the overplus she answered 'Oh I got it for lawyer Demain and I gave it to him ' They assured her she was a fool to do so that she should have kept all over five dollars and purchased herself shoes with it 'Oh I do not want money or clothes now I only want my son and if five dollars will get him more will surely get him ' And if the lawyer had returned it to her she avers she would not have accepted it She was perfectly willing he should have every coin she could raise if he would but restore her lost son to her Moreover the five dollars he required were for the remuneration of him who should go after her son and his master and not for his own services The lawyer now renewed his promise that she should have her son in twenty four hours But Isabella having no idea of this space of time went several times in a day to ascertain if her son had come Once when the servant opened the door and saw her she said in a tone expressive of much surprise 'Why this woman's come again ' She then wondered if she went too often When the lawyer appeared he told her the twenty four hours would not expire till the next morning if she would call then she would see her son The next morning saw Isabel at the lawyer's door while he was yet in his bed He now assured her it was morning till noon and that before noon her son would be there for he had sent the famous 'Matty Styles' after him who would not fail to have the boy and his master on hand in due season either dead or alive of that he was sure Telling her she need not come again he would himself inform her of their arrival After dinner he appeared at Mr Rutzer's a place the lawyer had procured for her while she awaited the arrival of her boy assuring her her son had come but that he stoutly denied having any mother or any relatives in that place and said 'she must go over and identify him ' She went to the office but at sight of her the boy cried aloud and regarded her as some terrible being who was about to take him away from a kind and loving friend He knelt even and begged them with tears not to take him away from his dear master who had brought him from the dreadful South and been so kind to him When he was questioned relative to the bad scar on his forehead he said 'Fowler's horse hove him ' And of the one on his cheek 'That was done by running against the carriage ' In answering these questions he looked imploringly at his master as much as to say 'If they are falsehoods you bade me say them may they be satisfactory to you at least ' The justice noting his appearance bade him forget his master and attend only to him But the boy persisted in denying his mother and clinging to his master saying his mother did not live in such a place as that However they allowed the mother to identify her son and Esquire Demain pleaded that he claimed the boy for her on the ground that he had been sold out of the State contrary to the laws in such cases made and provided spoke of the penalties annexed to said crime and of the sum of money the delinquent was to pay in case any one chose to prosecute him for the offence he had committed Isabella who was sitting in a corner scarcely daring to breathe thought within herself 'If I can but get the boy the may remain for whoever else chooses to prosecute I have done enough to make myself enemies already' and she trembled at the thought of the formidable enemies she had probably arrayed against herself helpless and despised as she was When the pleading was at an end Isabella understood the Judge to declare as the sentence of the Court that the 'boy be delivered into the hands of the mother having no other master no other controller no other conductor but his mother ' This sentence was obeyed he was delivered into her hands the boy meanwhile begging most piteously not to be taken from his dear master saying she was not his mother and that his mother did not live in such a place as that And it was some time before lawyer Demain the clerks and Isabella could collectively succeed in calming the child's fears and in convincing him that Isabella was not some terrible monster as he had for the last months probably been trained to believe and who in taking him away from his master was taking him from all good and consigning him to all evil When at last kind words and bon bons had quieted his fears and he could listen to their explanations he said to Isabella 'Well you do look like my mother used to ' and she was soon able to make him comprehend some of the obligations he was under and the relation he stood in both to herself and his master She commenced as soon as practicable to examine the boy and found to her utter astonishment that from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot the callosities and indurations on his entire body were most frightful to behold His back she described as being like her fingers as she laid them side by side 'Heavens what is all this ' said Isabel He answered 'It is where Fowler whipped kicked and beat me ' She exclaimed 'Oh Lord Jesus look see my poor child Oh Lord render unto them double for all this Oh my God Pete how did you bear it ' 'Oh this is nothing mammy if you should see Phillis I guess you'd scare She had a little baby and Fowler cut her till the milk as well as blood ran down her body You would scare to see Phillis mammy ' When Isabella inquired 'What did Miss Eliza Meaning Mrs Eliza Fowler say Pete when you were treated so badly ' he replied 'Oh mammy she said she wished I was with Bell Sometimes I crawled under the stoop mammy the blood running all about me and my back would stick to the boards and sometimes Miss Eliza would come and grease my sores when all were abed and asleep ' DEATH OF MRS ELIZA FOWLER As soon as possible she procured a place for Peter as tender of Locks at a place called Wahkendall near Greenkills After he was thus disposed of she visited her sister Sophia who resided at Newberg and spent the winter in several different families where she was acquainted She remained some time in the family of a Mr Latin who was a visiting relative of Solomon Gedney and the latter when he found Isabel with his cousin used all his influence to persuade him she was a great mischief maker and a very troublesome person that she had put him to some hundreds of dollars expense by fabricating lies about him and especially his sister and her family concerning her boy when the latter was living so like a gentleman with them and for his part he would not advise his friends to harbor or encourage her However his cousins the Latins could not see with the eyes of his feelings and consequently his words fell powerless on them and they retained her in their service as long as they had aught for her to do She then went to visit her former master Dumont She had scarcely arrived there when Mr Fred Waring entered and seeing Isabel pleasantly accosted her and asked her 'what she was driving at now a days ' On her answering 'nothing particular ' he requested her to go over to his place and assist his folks as some of them were sick and they needed an extra hand She very gladly assented When Mr W retired her master wanted to know why she wished to help people that called her the 'worst of devils ' as Mr Waring had done in the courthouse for he was the uncle of Solomon Gedney and attended the trial we have described and declared 'that she was a fool to he would n't do it ' 'Oh ' she told him 'she would not mind that but was very glad to have people forget their anger towards her ' She went over but too happy to feel that their resentment was passed and commenced her work with a light heart and a strong will She had not worked long in this frame of mind before a young daughter of Mr Waring rushed into the room exclaiming with uplifted hands 'Heavens and earth Isabella Fowler's murdered Cousin Eliza ' 'Ho ' said Isabel 'that's nothing he liked to have killed my child nothing saved him but God ' Meaning that she was not at all surprised at it for a man whose heart was sufficiently hardened to treat a mere child as hers had been treated was in her opinion more fiend than human and prepared for the commission of any crime that his passions might prompt him to The child further informed her that a letter had arrived by mail bringing the news Immediately after this announcement Solomon Gedney and his mother came in going direct to Mrs Waring's room where she soon heard tones as of some one reading She thought something said to her inwardly 'Go up stairs and hear ' At first she hesitated but it seemed to press her the more 'Go up and hear ' She went up unusual as it is for slaves to leave their work and enter unbidden their mistress's room for the sole purpose of seeing or hearing what may be seen or heard there But on this occasion Isabella says she walked in at the door shut it placed her back against it and listened She saw them and heard them read 'He knocked her down with his fist jumped on her with his knees broke her collarbone and tore out her wind pipe He then attempted his escape but was pursued and arrested and put in an iron bank for safekeeping ' And the friends were requested to go down and take away the poor innocent children who had thus been made in one short day more than orphans If this narrative should ever meet the eye of those innocent sufferers for another's guilt let them not be too deeply affected by the relation but placing their confidence in Him who sees the end from the beginning and controls the results rest secure in the faith that although they may physically suffer for the sins of others if they remain but true to themselves their highest and more enduring interests can never suffer from such a cause This relation should be suppressed for their sakes were it not even now so often denied that slavery is fast undermining all true regard for human life We know this one instance is not a demonstration to the contrary but adding this to the lists of tragedies that weekly come up to us through the Southern mails may we not admit them as proofs irrefragable The newspapers confirm this account of the terrible affair When Isabella had heard the letter all being too much absorbed in their own feelings to take note of her she returned to her work her heart swelling with conflicting emotions She was awed at the dreadful deed she mourned the fate of the loved Eliza who had in such an undeserved and barbarous manner been put away from her labors and watchings as a tender mother and 'last though not least ' in the development of her character and spirit her heart bled for the afflicted relatives even those of them who 'laughed at her calamity and mocked when her fear came ' Her thoughts dwelt long and intently on the subject and the wonderful chain of events that had conspired to bring her that day to that house to listen to that piece of intelligence to that house where she never was before or afterwards in her life and invited there by people who had so lately been hotly incensed against her It all seemed very remarkable to her and she viewed it as flowing from a special providence of God She thought she saw clearly that their unnatural bereavement was a blow dealt in retributive justice but she found it not in her heart to exult or rejoice over them She felt as if God had more than answered her petition when she ejaculated in her anguish of mind 'Oh Lord render unto them double ' She said 'I dared not find fault with God exactly but the language of my heart was 'Oh my God that's too much I did not mean quite so much God ' It was a terrible blow to the friends of the deceased and her selfish mother who said Isabella made such a 'to do about her boy not from affection 'but to have her own will and way' went deranged and walking to and fro in her delirium called aloud for her poor murdered daughter 'Eliza Eliza ' The derangement of Mrs G was a matter of hearsay as Isabella saw her not after the trial but she has no reason to doubt the truth of what she heard Isabel could never learn the subsequent fate of Fowler but heard in the spring of ' that his children had been seen in Kingston one of whom was spoken of as a fine interesting girl albeit a halo of sadness fell like a veil about her ISABELLA'S RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE We will now turn from the outward and temporal to the inward and spiritual life of our subject It is ever both interesting and instructive to trace the exercises of a human mind through the trials and mysteries of life and especially a naturally powerful mind left as hers was almost entirely to its own workings and the chance influences it met on its way and especially to note its reception of that divine 'light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world ' We see as knowledge dawns upon it truth and error strangely commingled here a bright spot illuminated by truth and there one darkened and distorted by error and the state of such a soul may be compared to a landscape at early dawn where the sun is seen superbly gilding some objects and causing others to send forth their lengthened distorted and sometimes hideous shadows Her mother as we have already said talked to her of God From these conversations her incipient mind drew the conclusion that God was 'a great man ' greatly superior to other men in power and being located 'high in the sky ' could see all that transpired on the earth She believed he not only saw but noted down all her actions in a great book even as her master kept a record of whatever he wished not to forget But she had no idea that God knew a thought of hers till she had uttered it aloud As we have before mentioned she had ever been mindful of her mother's injunctions spreading out in detail all her troubles before God imploring and firmly trusting him to send her deliverance from them Whilst yet a child she listened to a story of a wounded soldier left alone in the trail of a flying army helpless and starving who hardened the very ground about him with kneeling in his supplications to God for relief until it arrived From this narrative she was deeply impressed with the idea that if she also were to present her petitions under the open canopy of heaven speaking very loud she should the more readily be heard consequently she sought a fitting spot for this her rural sanctuary The place she selected in which to offer up her daily orisons was a small island in a small stream covered with large willow shrubbery beneath which the sheep had made their pleasant winding paths and sheltering themselves from the scorching rays of a noon tide sun luxuriated in the cool shadows of the graceful willows as they listened to the tiny falls of the silver waters It was a lonely spot and chosen by her for its beauty its retirement and because she thought that there in the noise of those waters she could speak louder to God without being overheard by any who might pass that way When she had made choice of her sanctum at a point of the island where the stream met after having been separated she improved it by pulling away the branches of the shrubs from the centre and weaving them together for a wall on the outside forming a circular arched alcove made entirely of the graceful willow To this place she resorted daily and in pressing times much more frequently At this time her prayers or more appropriately 'talks with God ' were perfectly original and unique and would be well worth preserving were it possible to give the tones and manner with the words but no adequate idea of them can be written while the tones and manner remain inexpressible She would sometimes repeat 'Our Father in heaven ' in her Low Dutch as taught her by her mother after that all was from the suggestions of her own rude mind She related to God in minute detail all her troubles and sufferings inquiring as she proceeded 'Do you think that's right God ' and closed by begging to be delivered from the evil whatever it might be She talked to God as familiarly as if he had been a creature like herself and a thousand times more so than if she had been in the presence of some earthly potentate She demanded with little expenditure of reverence or fear a supply of all her more pressing wants and at times her demands approached very near to commands She felt as if God was under obligation to her much more than she was to him He seemed to her benighted vision in some manner bound to do her bidding Her heart recoils now with very dread when she recalls these shocking almost blasphemous conversations with the great Jehovah And well for herself did she deem it that unlike earthly potentates his infinite character combined the tender father with the omniscient and omnipotent Creator of the universe She at first commenced promising God that if he would help her out of all her difficulties she would pay him by being very good and this goodness she intended as a remuneration to God She could think of no benefit that was to accrue to herself or her fellow creatures from her leading a life of purity and generous self sacrifice for the good of others as far as any but God was concerned she saw nothing in it but heart trying penance sustained by the sternest exertion and this she soon found much more easily promised than performed Days wore away new trials came God's aid was invoked and the same promises repeated and every successive night found her part of the contract unfulfilled She now began to excuse herself by telling God she could not be good in her present circumstances but if he would give her a new place and a good master and mistress she could and would be good and she expressly stipulated that she would be good one day to show God how good she would be all of the time when he should surround her with the right influences and she should be delivered from the temptations that then so sorely beset her But alas when night came and she became conscious that she had yielded to all her temptations and entirely failed of keeping her word with God having prayed and promised one hour and fallen into the sins of anger and profanity the next the mortifying reflection weighed on her mind and blunted her enjoyment Still she did not lay it deeply to heart but continued to repeat her demands for aid and her promises of pay with full purpose of heart at each particular time that that day she would not fail to keep her plighted word Thus perished the inward spark like a flame just igniting when one waits to see whether it will burn on or die out till the long desired change came and she found herself in a new place with a good mistress and one who never instigated an otherwise kind master to be unkind to her in short a place where she had literally nothing to complain of and where for a time she was more happy than she could well express 'Oh every thing there was so pleasant and kind and good and all so comfortable enough of every thing indeed it was beautiful ' she exclaimed Here at Mr Van Wagener's as the reader will readily perceive she must have been she was so happy and satisfied that God was entirely forgotten Why should her thoughts turn to Him who was only known to her as a help in trouble She had no trouble now her every prayer had been answered in every minute particular She had been delivered from her persecutors and temptations her youngest child had been given her and the others she knew she had no means of sustaining if she had them with her and was content to leave them behind Their father who was much older than Isabel and who preferred serving his time out in slavery to the trouble and dangers of the course she pursued remained with and could keep an eye on them though it is comparatively little that they can do for each other while they remain in slavery and this little the slave like persons in every other situation of life is not always disposed to perform There are slaves who copying the selfishness of their superiors in power in their conduct towards their fellows who may be thrown upon their mercy by infirmity or illness allow them to suffer for want of that kindness and care which it is fully in their power to render them The slaves in this country have ever been allowed to celebrate the principal if not some of the lesser festivals observed by the Catholics and Church of England many of them not being required to do the least service for several days and at Christmas they have almost universally an entire week to themselves except perhaps the attending to a few duties which are absolutely required for the comfort of the families they belong to If much service is desired they are hired to do it and paid for it as if they were free The more sober portion of them spend these holidays in earning a little money Most of them visit and attend parties and balls and not a few of them spend it in the lowest dissipation This respite from toil is granted them by all religionists of whatever persuasion and probably originated from the fact that many of the first slaveholders were members of the Church of England Frederick Douglass who has devoted his great heart and noble talents entirely to the furtherance of the cause of his down trodden race has said 'From what I know of the effect of their holidays upon the slave I believe them to be among the most effective means in the hands of the slaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection Were the slaveholders at once to abandon this practice I have not the slightest doubt it would lead to an immediate insurrection among the slaves These holidays serve as conductors or safety valves to carry off the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity But for these the slave would be forced up to the wildest desperation and woe betide the slaveholder the day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation of those conductors I warn him that in such an event a spirit will go forth in their midst more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake ' When Isabella had been at Mr Van Wagener's a few months she saw in prospect one of the festivals approaching She knows it by none but the Dutch name Pingster as she calls it but I think it must have been Whitsuntide in English She says she 'looked back into Egypt ' and everything looked 'so pleasant there ' as she saw retrospectively all her former companions enjoying their freedom for at least a little space as well as their wonted convivialities and in her heart she longed to be with them With this picture before her mind's eye she contrasted the quiet peaceful life she was living with the excellent people of Wahkendall and it seemed so dull and void of incident that the very contrast served but to heighten her desire to return that at least she might enjoy with them once more the coming festivities These feelings had occupied a secret corner of her breast for some time when one morning she told Mrs Van Wagener that her old master Dumont would come that day and that she should go home with him on his return They expressed some surprise and asked her where she obtained her information She replied that no one had told her but she felt that he would come It seemed to have been one of those 'events that cast their shadows before ' for before night Mr Dumont made his appearance She informed him of her intention to accompany him home He answered with a smile 'I shall not take you back again you ran away from me ' Thinking his manner contradicted his words she did not feel repulsed but made herself and child ready and when her former master had seated himself in the open dearborn she walked towards it intending to place herself and child in the rear and go with him But ere she reached the vehicle she says that God revealed himself to her with all the suddenness of a flash of lightning showing her 'in the twinkling of an eye that he was all over' that he pervaded the universe 'and that there was no place where God was not ' She became instantly conscious of her great sin in forgetting her almighty Friend and 'ever present help in time of trouble ' All her unfulfilled promises arose before her like a vexed sea whose waves run mountains high and her soul which seemed but one mass of lies shrunk back aghast from the 'awful look' of him whom she had formerly talked to as if he had been a being like herself and she would now fain have hid herself in the bowels of the earth to have escaped his dread presence But she plainly saw there was no place not even in hell where he was not and where could she flee Another such 'a look ' as she expressed it and she felt that she must be extinguished forever even as one with the breath of his mouth 'blows out a lamp ' so that no spark remains A dire dread of annihilation now seized her and she waited to see if by 'another look ' she was to be stricken from existence swallowed up even as the fire licketh up the oil with which it comes in contact When at last the second look came not and her attention was once more called to outward things she observed her master had left and exclaiming aloud 'Oh God I did not know you were so big ' walked into the house and made an effort to resume her work But the workings of the inward man were too absorbing to admit of much attention to her avocations She desired to talk to God but her vileness utterly forbade it and she was not able to prefer a petition 'What ' said she 'shall I lie again to God I have told him nothing but lies and shall I speak again and tell another lie to God ' She could not and now she began to wish for some one to speak to God for her Then a space seemed opening between her and God and she felt that if some one who was worthy in the sight of heaven would but plead for her in their own name and not let God know it came from her who was so unworthy God might grant it At length a friend appeared to stand between herself and an insulted Deity and she felt as sensibly refreshed as when on a hot day an umbrella had been interposed between her scorching head and a burning sun But who was this friend became the next inquiry Was it Deencia who had so often befriended her She looked at her with her new power of sight and lo she too seemed all 'bruises and putrifying sores ' like herself No it was some one very different from Deencia 'Who are you ' she exclaimed as the vision brightened into a form distinct beaming with the beauty of holiness and radiant with love She then said audibly addressing the mysterious visitant 'I know you and I don't know you ' Meaning 'You seem perfectly familiar I feel that you not only love me but that you always have loved me yet I know you not I cannot call you by name ' When she said 'I know you ' the subject of the vision remained distinct and quiet When she said 'I don't know you ' it moved restlessly about like agitated waters So while she repeated without intermission 'I know you I know you ' that the vision might remain 'Who are you ' was the cry of her heart and her whole soul was in one deep prayer that this heavenly personage might be revealed to her and remain with her At length after bending both soul and body with the intensity of this desire till breath and strength seemed failing and she could maintain her position no longer an answer came to her saying distinctly 'It is Jesus ' 'Yes ' she responded 'it is Jesus ' Previous to these exercises of mind she heard Jesus mentioned in reading or speaking but had received from what she heard no impression that he was any other than an eminent man like a Washington or a Lafayette Now he appeared to her delighted mental vision as so mild so good and so every way lovely and he loved her so much And how strange that he had always loved her and she had never known it And how great a blessing he conferred in that he should stand between her and God And God was no longer a terror and a dread to her She stopped not to argue the point even in her own mind whether he had reconciled her to God or God to herself though she thinks the former now being but too happy that God was no longer to her as a consuming fire and Jesus was 'altogether lovely ' Her heart was now full of joy and gladness as it had been of terror and at one time of despair In the light of her great happiness the world was clad in new beauty the very air sparkled as with diamonds and was redolent of heaven She contemplated the unapproachable barriers that existed between herself and the great of this world as the world calls greatness and made surprising comparisons between them and the union existing between herself and Jesus Jesus the transcendently lovely as well as great and powerful for so he appeared to her though he seemed but human and she watched for his bodily appearance feeling that she should know him if she saw him and when he came she should go and dwell with him as with a dear friend It was not given her to see that he loved any other and she thought if others came to know and love him as she did she should be thrust aside and forgotten being herself but a poor ignorant slave with little to recommend her to his notice And when she heard him spoken of she said mentally 'What others know Jesus I thought no one knew Jesus but me ' and she felt a sort of jealousy lest she should be robbed of her newly found treasure She conceived one day as she listened to reading that she heard an intimation that Jesus was married and hastily inquired if Jesus had a wife 'What ' said the reader 'God have a wife ' 'Is Jesus God ' inquired Isabella 'Yes to be sure he is ' was the answer returned From this time her conceptions of Jesus became more elevated and spiritual and she sometimes spoke of him as God in accordance with the teaching she had received But when she was simply told that the Christian world was much divided on the subject of Christ's nature some believing him to be co qual with the Father to be God in and of himself 'very God of very God ' some that he is the 'well beloved ' 'only begotten Son of God ' and others that he is or was rather but a mere man she said 'Of that I only know as I saw I did not see him to be God else how could he stand between me and God I saw him as a friend standing between me and God through whom love flowed as from a fountain ' Now so far from expressing her views of Christ's character and office in accordance with any system of theology extant she says she believes Jesus is the same spirit that was in our first parents Adam and Eve in the beginning when they came from the hand of their Creator When they sinned through disobedience this pure spirit forsook them and fled to heaven that there it remained until it returned again in the person of Jesus and that previous to a personal union with him man is but a brute possessing only the spirit of an animal She avers that in her darkest hours she had no fear of any worse hell than the one she then carried in her bosom though it had ever been pictured to her in its deepest colors and threatened her as a reward for all her misdemeanors Her vileness and God's holiness and all pervading presence which filled immensity and threatened her with instant annihilation composed the burden of her vision of terror Her faith in prayer is equal to her faith in the love of Jesus Her language is 'Let others say what they will of the efficacy of prayer I believe in it and I shall pray Thank God Yes I shall always pray ' she exclaims putting her hands together with the greatest enthusiasm For some time subsequent to the happy change we have spoken of Isabella's prayers partook largely of their former character and while in deep affliction she labored for the recovery of her son she prayed with constancy and fervor and the following may be taken as a specimen 'Oh God you know how much I am distressed for I have told you again and again Now God help me get my son If you were in trouble as I am and I could help you as you can me think I would n't do it Yes God you know I would do it ' 'Oh God you know I have no money but you can make the people do for me and you must make the people do for me I will never give you peace till you do God ' 'Oh God make the people hear me don't let them turn me off without hearing and helping me ' And she has not a particle of doubt that God heard her and especially disposed the hearts of thoughtless clerks eminent lawyers and grave judges and others between whom and herself there seemed to her almost an infinite remove to listen to her suit with patient and respectful attention backing it up with all needed aid The sense of her nothingness in the eyes of those with whom she contended for her rights sometimes fell on her like a heavy weight which nothing but her unwavering confidence in an arm which she believed to be stronger than all others combined could have raised from her sinking spirit 'Oh how little I did feel ' she repeated with a powerful emphasis 'Neither would you wonder if you could have seen me in my ignorance and destitution trotting about the streets meanly clad bare headed and bare footed Oh God only could have made such people hear me and he did it in answer to my prayers ' And this perfect trust based on the rock of Deity was a soul protecting fortress which raising her above the battlements of fear and shielding her from the machinations of the enemy impelled her onward in the struggle till the foe was vanquished and the victory gained We have now seen Isabella her youngest daughter and her only son in possession of at least their nominal freedom It has been said that the freedom of the most free of the colored people of this country is but nominal but stinted and limited as it is at best it is an immense remove from chattel slavery This fact is disputed I know but I have no confidence in the honesty of such questionings If they are made in sincerity I honor not the judgment that thus decides Her husband quite advanced in age and infirm of health was emancipated with the balance of the adult slaves of the State according to law the following summer July For a few years after this event he was able to earn a scanty living and when he failed to do that he was dependent on the 'world's cold charity ' and died in a poor house Isabella had herself and two children to provide for her wages were trifling for at that time the wages of females were at a small advance from nothing and she doubtless had to learn the first elements of economy for what slaves that were never allowed to make any stipulations or calculations for themselves ever possessed an adequate idea of the true value of time or in fact of any material thing in the universe To such 'prudent using' is meanness and 'saving' is a word to be sneered at Of course it was not in her power to make to herself a home around whose sacred hearth stone she could collect her family as they gradually emerged from their prison house of bondage a home where she could cultivate their affection administer to their wants and instil into the opening minds of her children those principles of virtue and that love of purity truth and benevolence which must ever form the foundation of a life of usefulness and happiness No all this was far beyond her power or means in more senses than one and it should be taken into the account whenever a comparison is instituted between the progress made by her children in virtue and goodness and the progress of those who have been nurtured in the genial warmth of a sunny home where good influences cluster and bad ones are carefully excluded where 'line upon line and precept upon precept ' are daily brought to their quotidian tasks and where in short every appliance is brought in requisition that self denying parents can bring to bear on one of the dearest objects of a parent's life the promotion of the welfare of their children But God forbid that this suggestion should be wrested from its original intent and made to shield any one from merited rebuke Isabella's children are now of an age to know good from evil and may easily inform themselves on any point where they may yet be in doubt and if they now suffer themselves to be drawn by temptation into the paths of the destroyer or forget what is due to the mother who has done and suffered so much for them and who now that she is descending into the vale of years and feels her health and strength declining will turn her expecting eyes to them for aid and comfort just as instinctly as the child turns its confiding eye to its fond parent when it seeks for succor or for sympathy for it is now their turn to do the work and bear the burdens of life as all must bear them in turn as the wheel of life rolls on if I say they forget this their duty and their happiness and pursue an opposite course of sin and folly they must lose the respect of the wise and good and find when too late that 'the way of the transgressor is hard ' NEW TRIALS The reader will pardon this passing homily while we return to our narrative We were saying that the day dreams of Isabella and her husband the plan they drew of what they would do and the comforts they thought to have when they should obtain their freedom and a little home of their own had all turned to 'thin air ' by the postponement of their freedom to so late a day These delusive hopes were never to be realized and a new set of trials was gradually to open before her These were the heart wasting trials of watching over her children scattered and imminently exposed to the temptations of the adversary with few if any fixed principles to sustain them 'Oh ' she says 'how little did I know myself of the best way to instruct and counsel them Yet I did the best I then knew when with them I took them to the religious meetings I talked to and prayed for and with them when they did wrong I scolded at and whipped them ' Isabella and her son had been free about a year when they went to reside in the city of New York a place which she would doubtless have avoided could she have seen what was there in store for her for this view into the future would have taught her what she only learned by bitter experience that the baneful influences going up from such a city were not the best helps to education commenced as the education of her children had been Her son Peter was at the time of which we are speaking just at that age when no lad should be subjected to the temptations of such a place unprotected as he was save by the feeble arm of a mother herself a servant there He was growing up to be a tall well formed active lad of quick perceptions mild and cheerful in his disposition with much that was open generous and willing about him but with little power to withstand temptation and a ready ingenuity to provide himself with ways and means to carry out his plans and conceal from his mother and her friends all such as he knew would not meet their approbation As will be readily believed he was soon drawn into a circle of associates who did not improve either his habits or his morals Two years passed before Isabella knew what character Peter was establishing for himself among his low and worthless comrades passing under the assumed name of Peter Williams and she began to feel a parent's pride in the promising appearance of her only son But alas this pride and pleasure were shortly dissipated as distressing facts relative to him came one by one to her astonished ear A friend of Isabella's a lady who was much pleased with the good humor ingenuity and open confessions of Peter when driven into a corner and who she said 'was so smart he ought to have an education if any one ought ' paid ten dollars as tuition fee for him to attend a navigation school But Peter little inclined to spend his leisure hours in study when he might be enjoying himself in the dance or otherwise with his boon companions went regularly and made some plausible excuses to the teacher who received them as genuine along with the ten dollars of Mrs and while his mother and her friend believed him improving at school he was to their latent sorrow improving in a very different place or places and on entirely opposite principles They also procured him an excellent place as a coachman But wanting money he sold his livery and other things belonging to his master who having conceived a kind regard for him considered his youth and prevented the law from falling with all its rigor upon his head Still he continued to abuse his privileges and to involve himself in repeated difficulties from which his mother as often extricated him At each time she talked much and reasoned and remonstrated with him and he would with such perfect frankness lay open his whole soul to her telling her he had never intended doing harm how he had been led along little by little till before he was aware he found himself in trouble how he had tried to be good and how when he would have been so 'evil was present with him ' indeed he knew not how it was His mother beginning to feel that the city was no place for him urged his going to sea and would have shipped him on board a man of war but Peter was not disposed to consent to that proposition while the city and its pleasures were accessible to him Isabella now became a prey to distressing fears dreading lest the next day or hour come fraught with the report of some dreadful crime committed or abetted by her son She thanks the Lord for sparing her that giant sorrow as all his wrong doings never ranked higher in the eye of the law than misdemeanors But as she could see no improvement in Peter as a last resort she resolved to leave him for a time unassisted to bear the penalty of his conduct and see what effect that would have on him In the trial hour she remained firm in her resolution Peter again fell into the hands of the police and sent for his mother as usual but she went not to his relief In his extremity he sent for Peter Williams a respectable colored barber whose name he had been wearing and who sometimes helped young culprits out of their troubles and sent them from city dangers by shipping them on board of whaling vessels The curiosity of this man was awakened by the culprit's bearing his own name He went to the Tombs and inquired into his case but could not believe what Peter told him respecting his mother and family Yet he redeemed him and Peter promised to leave New York in a vessel that was to sail in the course of a week He went to see his mother and informed her of what had happened to him She listened incredulously as to an idle tale He asked her to go with him and see for herself She went giving no credence to his story till she found herself in the presence of Mr Williams and heard him saying to her 'I am very glad I have assisted your son he stood in great need of sympathy and assistance but I could not think he had such a mother here although he assured me he had ' Isabella's great trouble now was a fear lest her son should deceive his benefactor and be missing when the vessel sailed but he begged her earnestly to trust him for he said he had resolved to do better and meant to abide by the resolve Isabella's heart gave her no peace till the time of sailing when Peter sent Mr Williams and another messenger whom she knew to tell her he had sailed But for a month afterwards she looked to see him emerging from some by place in the city and appearing before her so afraid was she that he was still unfaithful and doing wrong But he did not appear and at length she believed him really gone He left in the summer of and his friends heard nothing further from him till his mother received the following letter dated 'October ' 'MY DEAR AND BELOVED MOTHER 'I take this opportunity to write to you and inform you that I am well and in hopes for to find you the same I am got on board the same unlucky ship Done of Nantucket I am sorry for to say that I have been punished once severely by shoving my head in the fire for other folks We have had bad luck but in hopes to have better We have about on board but in

let me go Let me go to the spot where the cateract plays Where oft I have sported in my boyish days And there is my poor mother whose heart ever flows At the sight of her poor child to her let me go let me go 'Your only son 'PETER VAN WAGENER ' Since the date of the last letter Isabella has heard no tidings from her long absent son though ardently does her mother's heart long for such tidings as her thoughts follow him around the world in his perilous vocation saying within herself 'He is good now I have no doubt I feel sure that he has persevered and kept the resolve he made before he left home he seemed so different before he went so determined to do better ' His letters are inserted here for preservation in case they prove the last she ever hears from him in this world FINDING A BROTHER AND SISTER When Isabella had obtained the freedom of her son she remained in Kingston where she had been drawn by the judicial process about a year during which time she became a member of the Methodist Church there and when she went to New York she took a letter missive from that church to the Methodist Church in John street Afterwards she withdrew her connection with that church and joined Zion's Church in Church street composed entirely of colored people With the latter church she remained until she went to reside with Mr Pierson after which she was gradually drawn into the 'kingdom' set up by the prophet Matthias in the name of God the Father for he said the spirit of God the Father dwelt in him While Isabella was in New York her sister Sophia came from Newberg to reside in the former place Isabel had been favored with occasional interviews with this sister although at one time she lost sight of her for the space of seventeen years almost the entire period of her being at Mr Dumont's and when she appeared before her again handsomely dressed she did not recognize her till informed who she was Sophia informed her that her brother Michael a brother she had never seen was in the city and when she introduced him to Isabella he informed her that their sister Nancy had been living in the city and had deceased a few months before He described her features her dress her manner and said she had for some time been a member in Zion's Church naming the class she belonged to Isabella almost instantly recognized her as a sister in the church with whom she had knelt at the altar and with whom she had exchanged the speaking pressure of the hand in recognition of their spiritual sisterhood little thinking at the time that they were also children of the same earthly parents even Bomefree and Mau mau Bett As inquiries and answers rapidly passed and the conviction deepened that this was their sister the very sister they had heard so much of but had never seen for she was the self same sister that had been locked in the great old fashioned sleigh box when she was taken away never to behold her mother's face again this side the spirit land and Michael the narrator was the brother who had shared her fate Isabella thought 'D h here she was we met and was I not at the time struck with the peculiar feeling of her hand the bony hardness so just like mine and yet I could not know she was my sister and now I see she looked so like my mother ' And Isabella wept and not alone Sophia wept and the strong man Michael mingled his tears with theirs 'Oh Lord ' inquired Isabella 'what is this slavery that it can do such dreadful things what evil can it not do ' Well may she ask for surely the evils it can and does do daily and hourly can never be summed up till we can see them as they are recorded by him who writes no errors and reckons without mistake This account which now varies so widely in the estimate of different minds will be viewed alike by all Think you dear reader when that day comes the most 'rabid abolitionist' will say 'Behold I saw all this while on the earth ' Will he not rather say 'Oh who has conceived the breadth and depth of this moral malaria this putrescent plague spot ' Perhaps the pioneers in the slave's cause will be as much surprised as any to find that with all their looking there remained so much unseen GLEANINGS There are some hard things that crossed Isabella's life while in slavery that she has no desire to publish for various reasons First because the parties from whose hands she suffered them have rendered up their account to a higher tribunal and their innocent friends alone are living to have their feelings injured by the recital secondly because they are not all for the public ear from their very nature thirdly and not least because she says were she to tell all that happened to her as a slave all that she knows is 'God's truth' it would seem to others especially the uninitiated so unaccountable so unreasonable and what is usually called so unnatural though it may be questioned whether people do not always act naturally they would not easily believe it 'Why no ' she says 'they'd call me a liar they would indeed and I do not wish to say anything to destroy my own character for veracity though what I say is strictly true ' Some things have been omitted through forgetfulness which not having been mentioned in their places can only be briefly spoken of here such as that her father Bomefree had had two wives before he took Mau mau Bett one of whom if not both were torn from him by the iron hand of the ruthless trafficker in human flesh that her husband Thomas after one of his wives had been sold away from him ran away to New York City where he remained a year or two before he was discovered and taken back to the prison house of slavery that her master Dumont when he promised Isabella one year of her time before the State should make her free made the same promise to her husband and in addition to freedom they were promised a log cabin for a home of their own all of which with the one thousand and one day dreams resulting therefrom went into the repository of unfulfilled promises and unrealized hopes that she had often heard her father repeat a thrilling story of a little slave child which because it annoyed the family with its cries was caught up by a white man who dashed its brains out against the wall An Indian for Indians were plenty in that region then passed along as the bereaved mother washed the bloody corpse of her murdered child and learning the cause of its death said with characteristic vehemence 'If I had been here I would have put my tomahawk in his head ' meaning the murderer's Of the cruelty of one Hasbrouck He had a sick slavewoman who was lingering with a slow consumption whom he made to spin regardless of her weakness and suffering and this woman had a child that was unable to walk or talk at the age of five years neither could it cry like other children but made a constant piteous moaning sound This exhibition of helplessness and imbecility instead of exciting the master's pity stung his cupidity and so enraged him that he would kick the poor thing about like a foot ball Isabella's informant had seen this brute of a man when the child was curled up under a chair innocently amusing itself with a few sticks drag it thence that he might have the pleasure of tormenting it She had seen him with one blow of his foot send it rolling quite across the room and down the steps at the door Oh how she wished it might instantly die 'But ' she said 'it seemed as tough as a moccasin ' Though it did die at last and made glad the heart of its friends and its persecutor no doubt rejoiced with them but from very different motives But the day of his retribution was not far off for he sickened and his reason fled It was fearful to hear his old slave soon tell how in the day of his calamity she treated him She was very strong and was therefore selected to support her master as he set up in bed by putting her arms around while she stood behind him It was then that she did her best to wreak her vengeance on him She would clutch his feeble frame in her iron grasp as in a vice and when her mistress did not see would give him a squeeze a shake and lifting him up set him down again as hard as possible If his breathing betrayed too tight a grasp and her mistress said 'Be careful don't hurt him Soan ' her ever ready answer was 'Oh no Missus no ' in her most pleasant tone and then as soon as Missus's eyes and ears were engaged away another grasp another shake another bounce She was afraid the disease alone would let him recover an event she dreaded more than to do wrong herself Isabella asked her if she were not afraid his spirit would haunt her 'Oh no ' says Soan 'he was so wicked the devil will never let him out of hell long enough for that ' Many slaveholders boast of the love of their slaves How would it freeze the blood of some of them to know what kind of love rankles in the bosoms of slaves for them Witness the attempt to poison Mrs Calhoun and hundreds of similar cases Most 'surprising' to every body because committed by slaves supposed to be so grateful for their chains These reflections bring to mind a discussion on this point between the writer and a slaveholding friend in Kentucky on Christmas morning We had asserted that until mankind were far in advance of what they now are irresponsible power over our fellow beings would be as it is abused Our friend declared it his conviction that the cruelties of slavery existed chiefly in imagination and that no person in D County where we then were but would be above ill treating a helpless slave We answered that if his belief was well founded the people in Kentucky were greatly in advance of the people of New England for we would not dare say as much as that of any school district there letting alone counties No we would not answer for our own conduct even on so delicate a point The next evening he very magnanimously overthrew his own position and established ours by informing us that on the morning previous and as near as we could learn at the very hour in which we were earnestly discussing the probabilities of the case a young woman of fine appearance and high standing in society the pride of her husband and the mother of an infant daughter only a few miles from us ay in D County too was actually beating in the skull of a slave woman called Tabby and not content with that had her tied up and whipped after her skull was broken and she died hanging to the bedstead to which she had been fastened When informed that Tabby was dead she answered 'I am glad of it for she has worried my life out of me ' But Tabby's highest good was probably not the end proposed by Mrs M for no one supposed she meant to kill her Tabby was considered quite lacking in good sense and no doubt belonged to that class at the South that are silly enough to 'die of moderate correction ' A mob collected around the house for an hour or two in that manner expressing a momentary indignation But was she treated as a murderess Not at all She was allowed to take boat for her residence was near the beautiful Ohio that evening to spend a few months with her absent friends after which she returned and remained with her husband no one to 'molest or make her afraid ' Had she been left to the punishment of an outraged conscience from right motives I would have 'rejoiced with exceeding joy ' But to see the life of one woman and she a murderess put in the balance against the lives of three millions of innocent slaves and to contrast her punishment with what I felt would be the punishment of one who was merely suspected of being an equal friend of all mankind regardless of color or condition caused my blood to stir within me and my heart to sicken at the thought The husband of Mrs M was absent from home at the time alluded to and when he arrived some weeks afterwards bringing beautiful presents to his cherished companion he beheld his once happy home deserted Tabby murdered and buried in the garden and the wife of his bosom and the mother of his child the doer of the dreadful deed a murderess When Isabella went to New York city she went in company with a Miss Gear who introduced her to the family of Mr James Latourette a wealthy merchant and a Methodist in religion but who the latter part of his life felt that he had outgrown ordinances and advocated free meetings holding them at his own dwelling house for several years previous to his death She worked for them and they generously gave her a home while she labored for others and in their kindness made her as one of their own At that time the 'moral reform' movement was awakening the attention of the benevolent in that city Many women among whom were Mrs Latourette and Miss Gear became deeply interested in making an attempt to reform their fallen sisters even the most degraded of them and in this enterprise of labor and danger they enlisted Isabella and others who for a time put forth their most zealous efforts and performed the work of missionaries with much apparent success Isabella accompanied those ladies to the most wretched abodes of vice and misery and sometimes she went where they dared not follow They even succeeded in establishing prayer meetings in several places where such a thing might least have been expected But these meetings soon became the most noisy shouting ranting and boisterous of gatherings where they became delirious with excitement and then exhausted from over action Such meetings Isabel had not much sympathy with at best But one evening she attended one of them where the members of it in a fit of ecstasy jumped upon her cloak in such a manner as to drag her to the floor and then thinking she had fallen in a spiritual trance they increased their glorifications on her account jumping shouting stamping and clapping of hands rejoicing so much over her spirit and so entirely overlooking her body that she suffered much both from fear and bruises and ever after refused to attend any more such meetings doubting much whether God had any thing to do with such worship THE MATTHIAS IMPOSTURE We now come to an eventful period in the life of Isabella as identified with one of the most extraordinary religious impostures of modern times but the limits prescribed for the present work forbid a minute narration of all the occurrences that transpired in relation to it After she had joined the African Church in Church street and during her membership there she frequently attended Mr Latourette's meetings at one of which Mr Smith invited her to go to a prayer meeting or to instruct the girls at the Magdalene Asylum Bowery Hill then under the protection of Mr Pierson and some other persons chiefly respectable females To reach the Asylum Isabella called on Katy Mr Pierson's colored servant of whom she had some knowledge Mr Pierson saw her there conversed with her asked her if she had been baptized and was answered characteristically 'by the Holy Ghost ' After this Isabella saw Katy several times and occasionally Mr Pierson who engaged her to keep his house while Katy went to Virginia to see her children This engagement was considered an answer to prayer by Mr Pierson who had both fasted and prayed on the subject while Katy and Isabella appeared to see in it the hand of God Mr Pierson was characterized by a strong devotional spirit which finally became highly fanatical He assumed the title of Prophet asserting that God had called him in an omnibus in these words 'Thou art Elijah the Tishbite Gather unto me all the members of Israel at the foot of Mount Carmel' which he understood as meaning the gathering of his friends at Bowery Hill Not long afterward he became acquainted with the notorious Matthias whose career was as extraordinary as it was brief Robert Matthews or Matthias as he was usually called was of Scotch extraction but a native of Washington county New York and at that time about forty seven years of age He was religiously brought up among the Anti Burghers a sect of Presbyterians the clergyman the Rev Mr Bevridge visiting the family after the manner of the church and being pleased with Robert put his hand on his head when a boy and pronounced a blessing and this blessing with his natural qualities determined his character for he ever after thought he should be a distinguished man Matthias was brought up a farmer till nearly eighteen years of age but acquired indirectly the art of a carpenter without any regular apprenticeship and showed considerable mechanical skill He obtained property from his uncle Robert Thompson and then he went into business as a store keeper was considered respectable and became a member of the Scotch Presbyterian Church He married in and continued in business in Cambridge In he ruined himself by a building speculation and the derangement of the currency which denied bank facilities and soon after he came to New York with his family and worked at his trade He afterwards removed to Albany and became a hearer at the Dutch Reformed Church then under Dr Ludlow's charge He was frequently much excited on religious subjects In he was well known if not for street preaching for loud discussions and pavement exhortations but he did not make set sermons In the beginning of he was only considered zealous but in the same year he prophesied the destruction of the Albanians and their capital and while preparing to shave with the Bible before him he suddenly put down the soap and exclaimed 'I have found it I have found a text which proves that no man who shaves his beard can be a true Christian ' and shortly afterwards without shaving he went to the Mission House to deliver an address which he had promised and in this address he proclaimed his new character pronounced vengeance on the land and that the law of God was the only rule of government and that he was commanded to take possession of the world in the name of the King of kings His harangue was cut short by the trustees putting out the lights About this time Matthias laid by his implements of industry and in June he advised his wife to fly with him from the destruction which awaited them in the city and on her refusal partly on account of Matthias calling himself a Jew whom she was unwilling to retain as a husband he left her taking some of the children to his sister in Argyle forty miles from Albany At Argyle he entered the church and interrupted the minister declaring the congregation in darkness and warning them to repentance He was of course taken out of the church and as he was advertised in the Albany papers he was sent back to his family His beard had now obtained a respectable length and thus he attracted attention and easily obtained an audience in the streets For this he was sometimes arrested once by mistake for Adam Paine who collected the crowd and then left Matthias with it on the approach of the officers He repeatedly urged his wife to accompany him on a mission to convert the world declaring that food could be obtained from the roots of the forest if not administered otherwise At this time he assumed the name of Matthias called himself a Jew and set out on a mission taking a western course and visiting a brother at Rochester a skilful mechanic since dead Leaving his brother he proceeded on his mission over the Northern States occasionally returning to Albany After visiting Washington and passing through Pennsylvania he came to New York His appearance at that time was mean but grotesque and his sentiments were but little known On May the th he first called on Mr Pierson in Fourth street in his absence Isabella was alone in the house in which she had lived since the previous autumn On opening the door she for the first time beheld Matthias and her early impression of seeing Jesus in the flesh rushed into her mind She heard his inquiry and invited him into the parlor and being naturally curious and much excited and possessing a good deal of tact she drew him into conversation stated her own opinions and heard his replies and explanations Her faith was at first staggered by his declaring himself a Jew but on this point she was relieved by his saying 'Do you not remember how Jesus prayed ' and repeated part of the Lord's prayer in proof that the Father's kingdom was to come and not the Son's She then understood him to be a converted Jew and in the conclusion she says she 'felt as if God had sent him to set up the kingdom ' Thus Matthias at once secured the good will of Isabella and we may suppose obtained from her some information in relation to Mr Pierson especially that Mrs Pierson declared there was no true church and approved of Mr Pierson's preaching Matthias left the house promising to return on Saturday evening Mr P at this time had not seen Matthias Isabella desirous of hearing the expected conversation between Matthias and Mr Pierson on Saturday hurried her work got it finished and was permitted to be present Indeed the sameness of belief made her familiar with her employer while her attention to her work and characteristic faithfulness increased his confidence This intimacy the result of holding the same faith and the principle afterwards adopted of having but one table and all things in common made her at once the domestic and the equal and the depository of very curious if not valuable information To this object even her color assisted Persons who have travelled in the South know the manner in which the colored people and especially slaves are treated they are scarcely regarded as being present This trait in our American character has been frequently noticed by foreign travellers One English lady remarks that she discovered in course of conversation with a Southern married gentleman that a colored girl slept in his bedroom in which also was his wife and when he saw that it occasioned some surprise he remarked 'What would he do if he wanted a glass of water in the night ' Other travellers have remarked that the presence of colored people never seemed to interrupt conversation of any kind for one moment Isabella then was present at the first interview between Matthias and Pierson At this interview Mr Pierson asked Matthias if he had a family to which he replied in the affirmative he asked him about his beard and he gave a scriptural reason asserting also that the Jews did not shave and that Adam had a beard Mr Pierson detailed to Matthias his experience and Matthias gave his and they mutually discovered that they held the same sentiments both admitting the direct influence of the Spirit and the transmission of spirits from one body to another Matthias admitted the call of Mr Pierson in the omnibus in Wall street which on this occasion he gave in these words 'Thou art Elijah the Tishbite and thou shalt go before me in the spirit and power of Elias to prepare my way before me ' And Mr Pierson admitted Matthias' call who completed his declaration on the th of June in Argyle which by a curious coincidence was the very day on which Pierson had received his call in the omnibus Such singular coincidences have a powerful effect on excited minds From that discovery Pierson and Matthias rejoiced in each other and became kindred spirits Matthias however claiming to be the Father or to possess the spirit of the Father he was God upon earth because the spirit of God dwelt in him while Pierson then understood that his mission was like that of John the Baptist which the name Elias meant This conference ended with an invitation to supper and Matthias and Pierson washing each other's feet Mr Pierson preached on the following Sunday but after which he declined in favor of Matthias and some of the party believed that the 'kingdom had then come ' As a specimen of Matthias' preaching and sentiments the following is said to be reliable 'The spirit that built the Tower of Babel is now in the world it is the spirit of the devil The spirit of man never goes upon the clouds all who think so are Babylonians The only heaven is on the earth All who are ignorant of truth are Ninevites The Jews did not crucify Christ it was the Gentiles Every Jew has his guardian angel attending him in this world God don't speak through preachers he speaks through me his prophet ' John the Baptist addressing Mr Pierson read the tenth of Revelations ' After the reading of the the prophet resumed speaking as follows 'Ours is the mustard seed kingdom which is to spread all over the earth Our creed is truth and no man can find truth unless he obeys John the Baptist and comes clean into the church 'All real men will be saved all mock men will be damned When a person has the Holy Ghost then he is a man and not till then They who teach women are of the wicked The communion is all nonsense so is prayer Eating a nip of bread and drinking a little wine won't do any good All who admit members into their church and suffer them to hold their lands and houses their sentence is Depart ye wicked I know you not All females who lecture their husbands their sentence is the same The sons of truth are to enjoy all the good things of this world and must use their means to bring it about Every thing that has the smell of woman will be destroyed Woman is the capsheaf of the abomination of desolation full of all deviltry In a short time the world will take fire and dissolve it is combustible already All women not obedient had better become so as soon as possible and let the wicked spirit depart and become temples of truth Praying is all mocking When you see any one wring the neck of a fowl instead of cutting off its head he has not got the Holy Ghost Cutting gives the least pain 'All who eat swine's flesh are of the devil and just as certain as he eats it he will tell a lie in less than half an hour If you eat a piece of pork it will go crooked through you and the Holy Ghost will not stay in you but one or the other must leave the house pretty soon The pork will be as crooked in you as rams' horns and as great a nuisance as the hogs in the street 'The cholera is not the right word it is choler which means God's wrath Abraham Isaac and Jacob are now in this world they did not go up in the clouds as some believe why should they go there They don't want to go there to box the compass from one place to another The Christians now a days are for setting up the Son's kingdom It is not his it is the Father's kingdom It puts me in mind of the man in the country who took his son in business and had his sign made Hitchcock Son but the son wanted it Hitchcock Father and that is the way with your Christians They talk of the Son's kingdom first and not the Father's kingdom ' Matthias and his disciples at this time did not believe in a resurrection of the body but that the spirits of the former saints would enter the bodies of the present generation and thus begin heaven upon earth of which he and Mr Pierson were the first fruits Matthias made the residence of Mr Pierson his own but the latter being apprehensive of popular violence in his house if Matthias remained there proposed a monthly allowance to him and advised him to occupy another dwelling Matthias accordingly took a house in Clarkson street and then sent for his family at Albany but they declined coming to the city However his brother George complied with a similar offer bringing his family with him where they found very comfortable quarters Isabella was employed to do the housework In May Matthias left his house and placed the furniture part of which was Isabella's elsewhere living himself at the hotel corner of Marketfield and West streets Isabella found employment at Mr Whiting's Canal street and did the washing for Matthias by Mrs Whiting's permission Of the subsequent removal of Matthias to the farm and residence of Mr B Folger at Sing Sing where he was joined by Mr Pierson and others laboring under a similar religious delusion the sudden melancholy and somewhat suspicious death of Mr Pierson and the arrest of Matthias on the charge of his murder ending in a verdict of not guilty the criminal connection that subsisted between Matthias Mrs Folger and other members of the 'Kingdom ' as 'match spirits' the final dispersion of this deluded company and the voluntary exilement of Matthias in the far West after his release c c we do not deem it useful or necessary to give any particulars Those who are curious to know what there transpired are referred to a work published in New York in entitled 'Fanaticism its Sources and Influence illustrated by the simple Narrative of Isabella in the case of Matthias Mr and Mrs B Folger Mr Pierson Mr Mills Catharine Isabella c c By G Vale Roosevelt street ' Suffice it to say that while Isabella was a member of the household at Sing Sing doing much laborious service in the spirit of religious disinterestedness and gradually getting her vision purged and her mind cured of its illusions she happily escaped the contamination that surrounded her assiduously endeavoring to discharge all her duties in a becoming manner FASTING When Isabella resided with Mr Pierson he was in the habit of fasting every Friday not eating or drinking anything from Thursday evening to six o'clock on Friday evening Then again he would fast two nights and three days neither eating nor drinking refusing himself even a cup of cold water till the third day at night when he took supper again as usual Isabella asked him why he fasted He answered that fasting gave him great light in the things of God which answer gave birth to the following train of thought in the mind of his auditor 'Well if fasting will give light inwardly and spiritually I need it as much as any body and I'll fast too If Mr Pierson needs to fast two nights and three days then I who need light more than he does ought to fast more and I will fast three nights and three days ' This resolution she carried out to the letter putting not so much as a drop of water in her mouth for three whole days and nights The fourth morning as she arose to her feet not having power to stand she fell to the floor but recovering herself sufficiently she made her way to the pantry and feeling herself quite voracious and fearing that she might now offend God by her voracity compelled herself to breakfast on dry bread and water eating a large six penny loaf before she felt at all stayed or satisfied She says she did get light but it was all in her body and none in her mind and this lightness of body lasted a long time Oh she was so light and felt so well she could 'skim around like a gull ' THE CAUSE OF HER LEAVING THE CITY The first years spent by Isabella in the city she accumulated more than enough to supply all her wants and she placed all the overplus in the Savings' Bank Afterwards while living with Mr Pierson he prevailed on her to take it thence and invest it in a common fund which he was about establishing as a fund to be drawn from by all the faithful the faithful of course were the handful that should subscribe to his peculiar creed This fund commenced by Mr Pierson afterwards became part and parcel of the kingdom of which Matthias assumed to be head and at the breaking up of the kingdom her little property was merged in the general ruin or went to enrich those who profited by the loss of others if any such there were Mr Pierson and others had so assured her that the fund would supply all her wants at all times and in all emergencies and to the end of life that she became perfectly careless on the subject asking for no interest when she drew her money from the bank and taking no account of the sum she placed in the fund She recovered a few articles of furniture from the wreck of the kingdom and received a small sum of money from Mr B Folger as the price of Mrs Folger's attempt to convict her of murder With this to start upon she commenced anew her labors in the hope of yet being able to accumulate a sufficiency to make a little home for herself in her advancing age With this stimulus before her she toiled hard working early and late doing a great deal for a little money and turning her hand to almost any thing that promised good pay Still she did not prosper and somehow could not contrive to lay by a single dollar for a 'rainy day ' When this had been the state of her affairs some time she suddenly paused and taking a retrospective view of what had passed inquired within herself why it was that for all her unwearied labors she had nothing to show why it was that others with much less care and labor could hoard up treasures for themselves and children She became more and more convinced as she reasoned that every thing she had undertaken in the city of New York had finally proved a failure and where her hopes had been raised the highest there she felt the failure had been the greatest and the disappointment most severe After turning it in her mind for some time she came to the conclusion that she had been taking part in a great drama which was in itself but one great system of robbery and wrong 'Yes ' she said 'the rich rob the poor and the poor rob one another ' True she had not received labor from others and stinted their pay as she felt had been practised against her but she had taken their work from them which was their only means to get money and was the same to them in the end For instance a gentleman where she lived would give her a half dollar to hire a poor man to clear the new fallen snow from the steps and side walks She would arise early and perform the labor herself putting the money into her own pocket A poor man would come along saying she ought to have let him have the job he was poor and needed the pay for his family She would harden her heart against him and answer 'I am poor too and I need it for mine ' But in her retrospection she thought of all the misery she might have been adding to in her selfish grasping and it troubled her conscience sorely and this insensibility to the claims of human brotherhood and the wants of the destitute and wretched poor she now saw as she never had done before to be unfeeling selfish and wicked These reflections and convictions gave rise to a sudden revulsion of feeling in the heart of Isabella and she began to look upon money and property with great indifference if not contempt being at that time unable probably to discern any difference between a miserly grasping at and hoarding of money and means and a true use of the good things of this life for one's own comfort and the relief of such as she might be enabled to befriend and assist One thing she was sure of that the precepts 'Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you ' 'Love your neighbor as yourself ' and so forth were maxims that had been but little thought of by herself or practised by those about her Her next decision was that she must leave the city it was no place for her yea she felt called in spirit to leave it and to travel east and lecture She had never been further east than the city neither had she any friends there of whom she had particular reason to expect any thing yet to her it was plain that her mission lay in the east and that she would find friends there She determined on leaving but these determinations and convictions she kept close locked in her own breast knowing that if her children and friends were aware of it they would make such an ado about it as would render it very unpleasant if not distressing to all parties Having made what preparations for leaving she deemed necessary which was to put up a few articles of clothing in a pillow case all else being deemed an unnecessary incumbrance about an hour before she left she informed Mrs Whiting the woman of the house where she was stopping that her name was no longer Isabella but SOJOURNER and that she was going east And to her inquiry 'What are you going east for ' her answer was 'The Spirit calls me there and I must go ' She left the city on the morning of the st of June crossing over to Brooklyn L I and taking the rising sun for her only compass and guide she 'remembered Lot's wife ' and hoping to avoid her fate she resolved not to look back till she felt sure the wicked city from which she was fleeing was left too far behind to be visible in the distance and when she first ventured to look back she could just discern the blue cloud of smoke that hung over it and she thanked the Lord that she was thus far removed from what seemed to her a second Sodom She was now fairly started on her pilgrimage her bundle in one hand and a little basket of provisions in the other and two York shillings in her purse her heart strong in the faith that her true work lay before her and that the Lord was her director and she doubted not he would provide for and protect her and that it would be very censurable in her to burden herself with any thing more than a moderate supply for her then present needs Her mission was not merely to travel east but to 'lecture ' as she designated it 'testifying of the hope that was in her' exhorting the people to embrace Jesus and refrain from sin the nature and origin of which she explained to them in accordance with her own most curious and original views Through her life and all its chequered changes she has ever clung fast to her first permanent impressions on religious subjects Wherever night overtook her there she sought for lodgings free if she might if not she paid at a tavern if she chanced to be at one if not at a private dwelling with the rich if they would receive her if not with the poor But she soon discovered that the largest houses were nearly always full if not quite full company was soon expected and that it was much easier to find an unoccupied corner in a small house than in a large one and if a person possessed but a miserable roof over his head you might be sure of a welcome to part of it But this she had penetration enough to see was quite as much the effect of a want of sympathy as of benevolence and this was also very apparent in her religious conversations with people who were strangers to her She said 'she never could find out that the rich had any religion If I had been rich and accomplished I could for the rich could always find religion in the rich and I could find it among the poor ' At first she attended such meetings as she heard of in the vicinity of her travels and spoke to the people as she found them assembled Afterwards she advertised meetings of her own and held forth to large audiences having as she said 'a good time ' When she became weary of travelling and wished a place to stop a while and rest herself she said some opening for her was always near at hand and the first time she needed rest a man accosted her as she was walking inquiring if she was looking for work She told him that was not the object of her travels but that she would willingly work a few days if any one wanted He requested her to go to his family who were sadly in want of assistance which he had been thus far unable to supply She went to the house where she was directed and was received by his family one of whom was ill as a 'God send ' and when she felt constrained to resume her journey they were very sorry and would fain have detained her longer but as she urged the necessity of leaving they offered her what seemed in her eyes a great deal of money as a remuneration for her labor and an expression of their gratitude for her opportune assistance but she would only receive a very little of it enough as she says to enable her to pay tribute to C sar if it was demanded of her and two or three York shillings at a time were all she allowed herself to take and then with purse replenished and strength renewed she would once more set out to perform her mission THE CONSEQUENCES OF REFUSING A TRAVELLER A NIGHT'S LODGING As she drew near the centre of the Island she commenced one evening at nightfall to solicit the favor of a night's lodging She had repeated her request a great many it seemed to her some twenty times and as many times she received a negative answer She walked on the stars and the tiny horns of the new moon shed but a dim light on her lonely way when she was familiarly accosted by two Indians who took her for an acquaintance She told them they were mistaken in the person she was a stranger there and asked them the direction to a tavern They informed her it was yet a long way some two miles or so and inquired if she were alone Not wishing for their protection or knowing what might be the character of their kindness she answered 'No not exactly ' and passed on At the end of a weary way she came to the tavern or rather to a large building which was occupied as court house tavern and jail and on asking for a night's lodging was informed she could stay if she would consent to be locked in This to her mind was an insuperable objection To have a key turned on her was a thing not to be thought of at least not to be endured and she again took up her line of march preferring to walk beneath the open sky to being locked up by a stranger in such a place She had not walked far before she heard the voice of a woman under an open shed she ventured to accost her and inquired if she knew where she could get in for the night The woman answered that she did not unless she went home with them and turning to her 'good man ' asked him if the stranger could not share their home for the night to which he cheerfully assented Sojourner thought it evident he had been taking a drop too much but as he was civil and good natured and she did not feel inclined to spend the night alone in the open air she felt driven to the necessity of accepting their hospitality whatever it might prove to be The woman soon informed her that there was a ball in the place at which they would like to drop in a while before they went to their home Balls being no part of Sojourner's mission she was not desirous of attending but her hostess could be satisfied with nothing short of a taste of it and she was forced to go with her or relinquish their company at once in which move there might be more exposure than in accompanying her She went and soon found herself surrounded by an assemblage of people collected from the very dregs of society too ignorant and degraded to understand much less entertain a high or bright idea in a dirty hovel destitute of every comfort and where the fumes of whisky were abundant and powerful Sojourner's guide there was too much charmed with the combined entertainments of the place to be able to tear herself away till she found her faculties for enjoyment failing her from a too free use of liquor and she betook herself to bed till she could recover them Sojourner seated in a corner had time for many reflections and refrained from lecturing them in obedience to the recommendation 'Cast not your pearls ' c When the night was far spent the husband of the sleeping woman aroused the sleeper and reminded her that she was not very polite to the woman she had invited to sleep at her house and of the propriety of returning home They once more emerged into the pure air which to our friend Sojourner after so long breathing the noisome air of the ball room was most refreshing and grateful Just as day dawned they reached the place they called their home Sojourner now saw that she had lost nothing in the shape of rest by remaining so long at the ball as their miserable cabin afforded but one bunk or pallet for sleeping and had there been many such she would have preferred sitting up all night to occupying one like it They very politely offered her the bed if she would use it but civilly declining she waited for morning with an eagerness of desire she never felt before on the subject and was never more happy than when the eye of day shed its golden light once more over the earth She was once more free and while day light should last independent and needed no invitation to pursue her journey Let these facts teach us that every pedestrian in the world is not a vagabond and that it is a dangerous thing to compel any one to receive that hospitality from the vicious and abandoned which they should have received from us as thousands can testify who have thus been caught in the snares of the wicked The fourth of July Isabella arrived at Huntingdon from thence she went to Cold Springs where she found the people making preparations for a mass temperance meeting With her usual alacrity she entered into their labors getting up dishes a la New York greatly to the satisfaction of those she assisted After remaining at Cold Springs some three weeks she returned to Huntingdon where she took boat for Connecticut Landing at Bridgeport she again resumed her travels towards the north east lecturing some and working some to get wherewith to pay tribute to C sar as she called it and in this manner she presently came to the city of New Haven where she found many meetings which she attended at some of which she was allowed to express her views freely and without reservation She also called meetings expressly to give herself an opportunity to be heard and found in the city many true friends of Jesus as she judged with whom she held communion of spirit having no preference for one sect more than another but being well satisfied with all who gave her evidence of having known or loved the Savior After thus delivering her testimony in this pleasant city feeling she had not as yet found an abiding place she went from thence to Bristol at the request of a zealous sister who desired her to go to the latter place and hold a religious conversation with some friends of hers there She went as requested found the people kindly and religiously disposed and through them she became acquainted with several very interesting persons A spiritually minded brother in Bristol becoming interested in her new views and original opinions requested as a favor that she would go to Hartford to see and converse with friends of his there Standing ready to perform any service in the Lord she went to Hartford as desired bearing in her hand the following note from this brother 'SISTER I send you this living messenger as I believe her to be one that God loves Ethiopia is stretching forth her hands unto God You can see by this sister that God does by his Spirit alone teach his own children things to come Please receive her and she will tell you some new things Let her tell her story without interrupting her and give close attention and you will see she has got the lever of truth that God helps her to pry where but few can She cannot read or write but the law is in her heart 'Send her to brother brother and where she can do the most good 'From your brother H L B ' SOME OF HER VIEWS AND REASONINGS As soon as Isabella saw God as an all powerful all pervading spirit she became desirous of hearing all that had been written of him and listened to the account of the creation of the world and its first inhabitants as contained in the first s of Genesis with peculiar interest For some time she received it all literally though it appeared strange to her that 'God worked by the day got tired and stopped to rest ' c But after a little time she began to reason upon it thus 'Why if God works by the day and one day's work tires him and he is obliged to rest either from weariness or on account of darkness or if he waited for the cool of the day to walk in the garden because he was inconvenienced by the heat of the sun why then it seems that God cannot do as much as I can for I can bear the sun at noon and work several days and nights in succession without being much tired Or if he rested nights because of the darkness it is very queer that he should make the night so dark that he could not see himself If I had been God I would have made the night light enough for my own convenience surely ' But the moment she placed this idea of God by the side of the impression she had once so suddenly received of his inconceivable greatness and entire spirituality that moment she exclaimed mentally 'No God does not stop to rest for he is a spirit and cannot tire he cannot want for light for he hath all light in himself And if God is all in all and worketh all in all as I have heard them read then it is impossible he should rest at all for if he did every other thing would stop and rest too the waters would not flow and the fishes could not swim and all motion must cease God could have no pauses in his work and he needed no Sabbaths of rest Man might need them and he should take them when he needed them whenever he required rest As it regarded the worship of God he was to be worshipped at all times and in all places and one portion of time never seemed to her more holy than another ' These views which were the result of the workings of her own mind assisted solely by the light of her own experience and very limited knowledge were for a long time after their adoption closely locked in her own breast fearing lest their avowal might bring upon her the imputation of 'infidelity ' the usual charge preferred by all religionists against those who entertain religious views and feelings differing materially from their own If from their own sad experience they are withheld from shouting the cry of 'infidel ' they fail not to see and to feel ay and to say that the dissenters are not of the right spirit and that their spiritual eyes have never been unsealed While travelling in Connecticut she met a minister with whom she held a long discussion on these points as well as on various other topics such as the origin of all things especially the origin of evil at the same time bearing her testimony strongly against a paid ministry He belonged to that class and as a matter of course as strongly advocated his own side of the question I had forgotten to mention in its proper place a very important fact that when she was examining the scriptures she wished to hear them without comment but if she employed adult persons to read them to her and she asked them to read a passage over again they invariably commenced to explain by giving her their version of it and in this way they tried her feelings exceedingly In consequence of this she ceased to ask adult persons to read the Bible to her and substituted children in their stead Children as soon as they could read distinctly would re read the same sentence to her as often as she wished and without comment and in that way she was enabled to see what her own mind could make out of the record and that she said was what she wanted and not what others thought it to mean She wished to compare the teachings of the Bible with the witness within her and she came to the conclusion that the spirit of truth spoke in those records but that the recorders of those truths had intermingled with them ideas and suppositions of their own This is one among the many proofs of her energy and independence of character When it became known to her children that Sojourner had left New York they were filled with wonder and alarm Where could she have gone and why had she left were questions no one could answer satisfactorily Now their imaginations painted her as a wandering maniac and again they feared she had been left to commit suicide and many were the tears they shed at the loss of her But when she reached Berlin Conn she wrote to them by amanuensis informing them of her whereabouts and waiting an answer to her letter thus quieting their fears and gladdening their hearts once more with assurances of her continued life and her love THE SECOND ADVENT DOCTRINES In Hartford and vicinity she met with several persons who believed in the 'Second Advent' doctrines or the immediate personal appearance of Jesus Christ At first she thought she had never heard of 'Second Advent ' But when it was explained to her she recollected having once attended Mr Miller's meeting in New York where she saw a great many enigmatical pictures hanging on the wall which she could not understand and which being out of the reach of her understanding failed to interest her In this section of country she attended two camp meetings of the believers in these doctrines the 'second advent' excitement being then at its greatest height The last meeting was at Windsor Lock The people as a matter of course eagerly inquired of her concerning her belief as it regarded their most important tenet She told them it had not been revealed to her perhaps if she could read she might see it differently Sometimes to their eager inquiry 'Oh don't you believe the Lord is coming ' she answered 'I believe the Lord is as near as he can be and not be it ' With these evasive and non exciting answers she kept their minds calm as it respected her unbelief till she could have an opportunity to hear their views fairly stated in order to judge more understandingly of this matter and see if in her estimation there was any good ground for expecting an event which was in the minds of so many as it were shaking the very foundations of the universe She was invited to join them in their religious exercises and accepted the invitation praying and talking in her own peculiar style and attracting many about her by her singing When she had convinced the people that she was a lover of God and his cause and had gained a good standing with them so that she could get a hearing among them she had become quite sure in her own mind that they were laboring under a delusion and she commenced to use her influence to calm the fears of the people and pour oil upon the troubled waters In one part of the grounds she found a knot of people greatly excited she mounted a stump and called out 'Hear hear ' When the people had gathered around her as they were in a state to listen to any thing new she addressed them as 'children ' and asked them why they made such a 'To do are you not commanded to watch and pray You are neither watching nor praying ' And she bade them with the tones of a kind mother retire to their tents and there watch and pray without noise or tumult for the Lord would not come to such a scene of confusion 'the Lord came still and quiet ' She assured them 'the Lord might come move all through the camp and go away again and they never know it ' in the state they then were They seemed glad to seize upon any reason for being less agitated and distressed and many of them suppressed their noisy terror and retired to their tents to 'watch and pray ' begging others to do the same and listen to the advice of the good sister She felt she had done some good and then went to listen further to the preachers They appeared to her to be doing their utmost to agitate and excite the people who were already too much excited and when she had listened till her feelings would let her listen silently no longer she arose and addressed the preachers The following are specimens of her speech 'Here you are talking about being changed in the twinkling of an eye If the Lord should come he'd change you to nothing for there is nothing to you 'You seem to be expecting to go to some parlor away up somewhere and when the wicked have been burnt you are coming back to walk in triumph over their ashes this is to be your New Jerusalem Now I can't see any thing so very nice in that coming back to such a muss as that will be a world covered with the ashes of the wicked Besides if the Lord comes and burns as you say he will I am not going away I am going to stay here and stand the fire like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego And Jesus will walk with me through the fire and keep me from harm Nothing belonging to God can burn any more than God himself such shall have no need to go away to escape the fire No I shall remain Do you tell me that God's children can't stand fire ' And her manner and tone spoke louder than words saying 'It is absurd to think so ' The ministers were taken quite aback at so unexpected an opposer and one of them in the kindest possible manner commenced a discussion with her by asking her questions and quoting scripture to her concluding finally that although she had learned nothing of the great doctrine which was so exclusively occupying their minds at the time she had learned much that man had never taught her At this meeting she received the address of different persons residing in various places with an invitation to visit them She promised to go soon to Cabotville and started shaping her course for that place She arrived at Springfield one evening at six o'clock and immediately began to search for a lodging for the night She walked from six till past nine and was then on the road from Springfield to Cabotville before she found any one sufficiently hospitable to give her a night's shelter under their roof Then a man gave her twenty five cents and bade her go to a tavern and stay all night She did so returning in the morning to thank him assuring him she had put his money to its legitimate use She found a number of the friends she had seen at Windsor when she reached the manufacturing town of Cabotville which has lately taken the name of Chicopee and with them she spent a pleasant week or more after which she left them to visit the Shaker village in Enfield She now began to think of finding a resting place at least for a season for she had performed quite a long journey considering she had walked most of the way and she had a mind to look in upon the Shakers and see how things were there and whether there was any opening there for her But on her way back to Springfield she called at a house and asked for a piece of bread her request was granted and she was kindly invited to tarry all night as it was getting late and she would not be able to stay at every house in that vicinity which invitation she cheerfully accepted When the man of the house came in he recollected having seen her at the camp meeting and repeated some conversations by which she recognized him again He soon proposed having a meeting that evening went out and notified his friends and neighbors who came together and she once more held forth to them in her peculiar style Through the agency of this meeting she became acquainted with several people residing in Springfield to whose houses she was cordially invited and with whom she spent some pleasant time One of these friends writing of her arrival there speaks as follows After saying that she and her people belonged to that class of persons who believed in the second advent doctrines and that this class believing also in freedom of speech and action often found at their meetings many singular people who did not agree with them in their principal doctrine and that being thus prepared to hear new and strange things 'They listened eagerly to Sojourner and drank in all she said ' and also that she 'soon became a favorite among them that when she arose to speak in their assemblies her commanding figure and dignified manner hushed every trifler into silence and her singular and sometimes uncouth modes of expression never provoked a laugh but often were the whole audience melted into tears by her touching stories ' She also adds 'Many were the lessons of wisdom and faith I have delighted to learn from her ' 'She continued a great favorite in our meetings both on account of her remarkable gift in prayer and still more remarkable talent for singing and the aptness and point of her remarks frequently illustrated by figures the most original and expressive 'As we were walking the other day she said she had often thought what a beautiful world this would be when we should see every thing right side up Now we see every thing topsy turvy and all is confusion ' For a person who knows nothing of this fact in the science of optics this seemed quite a remarkable idea 'We also loved her for her sincere and ardent piety her unwavering faith in God and her contempt of what the world calls fashion and what we call folly 'She was in search of a quiet place where a way worn traveller might rest She had heard of Fruitlands and was inclined to go there but the friends she found here thought it best for her to visit Northampton She passed her time while with us working wherever her work was needed and talking where work was not needed 'She would not receive money for her work saying she worked for the Lord and if her wants were supplied she received it as from the Lord 'She remained with us till far into winter when we introduced her at the Northampton Association ' 'She wrote to me from thence that she had found the quiet resting place she had so long desired And she has remained there ever since ' ANOTHER CAMP MEETING When Sojourner had been at Northampton a few months she attended another camp meeting at which she performed a very important part A party of wild young men with no motive but that of entertaining themselves by annoying and injuring the feelings of others had assembled at the meeting hooting and yelling and in various ways interrupting the services and causing much disturbance Those who had the charge of the meeting having tried their persuasive powers in vain grew impatient and tried threatening The young men considering themselves insulted collected their friends to the number of a hundred or more dispersed themselves through the grounds making the most frightful noises and threatening to fire the tents It was said the authorities of the meeting sat in grave consultation decided to have the ring leaders arrested and sent for the constable to the great displeasure of some of the company who were opposed to such an appeal to force and arms Be that as it may Sojourner seeing great consternation depicted in every countenance caught the contagion and ere she was aware found herself quaking with fear Under the impulse of this sudden emotion she fled to the most retired corner of a tent and secreted herself behind a trunk saying to herself 'I am the only colored person here and on me probably their wicked mischief will fall first and perhaps fatally ' But feeling how great her insecurity even there as the very tent began to shake from its foundations she began to soliloquize as follows 'Shall I run away and hide from the Devil Me a servant of the living God Have I not faith enough to go out and quell that mob when I know it is written One shall chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight I know there are not a thousand here and I know I am a servant of the living God I'll go to the rescue and the Lord shall go with and protect me 'Oh ' said she 'I felt as if I had three hearts and that they were so large my body could hardly hold them ' She now came forth from her hiding place and invited several to go with her and see what they could do to still the raging of the moral elements They declined and considered her wild to think of it The meeting was in the open fields the full moon shed its saddened light over all and the woman who was that evening to address them was trembling on the preachers' stand The noise and confusion were now terrific Sojourner left the tent alone and unaided and walking some thirty rods to the top of a small rise of ground commenced to sing in her most fervid manner with all the strength of her most powerful voice the hymn on the resurrection of Christ 'It was early in the morning it was early in the morning Just at the break of day When he rose when he rose when he rose And went to heaven on a cloud ' All who have ever heard her sing this hymn will probably remember it as long as they remember her The hymn the tune the style are each too closely associated with to be easily separated from herself and when sung in one of her most animated moods in the open air with the utmost strength of her most powerful voice must have been truly thrilling As she commenced to sing the young men made a rush towards her and she was immediately encircled by a dense body of the rioters many of them armed with sticks or clubs as their weapons of defence if not of attack As the circle narrowed around her she ceased singing and after a short pause inquired in a gentle but firm tone 'Why do you come about me with clubs and sticks I am not doing harm to any one ' 'We ar'n't a going to hurt you old woman we came to hear you sing ' cried many voices simultaneously 'Sing to us old woman ' cries one 'Talk to us old woman ' says another 'Pray old woman ' says a third 'Tell us your experience ' says a fourth 'You stand and smoke so near me I cannot sing or talk ' she answered 'Stand back ' said several authoritative voices with not the most gentle or courteous accompaniments raising their rude weapons in the air The crowd suddenly gave back the circle became larger as many voices again called for singing talking or praying backed by assurances that no one should be allowed to hurt her the speakers declaring with an oath that they would 'knock down' any person who should offer her the least indignity She looked about her and with her usual discrimination said inwardly 'Here must be many young men in all this assemblage bearing within them hearts susceptible of good impressions I will speak to them ' She did speak they silently heard and civilly asked her many questions It seemed to her to be given her at the time to answer them with truth and wisdom beyond herself Her speech had operated on the roused passions of the mob like oil on agitated waters they were as a whole entirely subdued and only clamored when she ceased to speak or sing Those who stood in the background after the circle was enlarged cried out 'Sing aloud old woman we can't hear ' Those who held the sceptre of power among them requested that she should make a pulpit of a neighboring wagon She said 'If I do they'll overthrow it ' 'No they sha'n't he who dares hurt you we'll knock him down instantly d n him ' cried the chiefs 'No we won't no we won't nobody shall hurt you ' answered the many voices of the mob They kindly assisted her to mount the wagon from which she spoke and sung to them about an hour Of all she said to them on the occasion she remembers only the following 'Well there are two congregations on this ground It is written that there shall be a separation and the sheep shall be separated from the goats The other preachers have the sheep I have the goats And I have a few sheep among my goats but they are very ragged ' This exordium produced great laughter When she became wearied with talking she began to cast about her to contrive some way to induce them to disperse While she paused they loudly clamored for 'more ' 'more ' 'sing ' 'sing more ' She motioned them to be quiet and called out to them 'Children I have talked and sung to you as you asked me and now I have a request to make of you will you grant it ' 'Yes yes yes ' resounded from every quarter 'Well it is this ' she answered 'if I will sing one more hymn for you will you then go away and leave us this night in peace ' 'Yes yes ' came faintly feebly from a few 'I repeat it ' says Sojourner 'and I want an answer from you all as of one accord If I will sing you one more you will go away and leave us this night in peace ' 'Yes yes yes ' shouted many voices with hearty emphasis 'I repeat my request once more ' said she 'and I want you all to answer ' And she reiterated the words again This time a long loud 'Yes yes yes ' came up as from the multitudinous mouth of the entire mob 'AMEN it is SEALED ' repeated Sojourner in the deepest and most solemn tones of her powerful and sonorous voice Its effect ran through the multitude like an electric shock and the most of them considered themselves bound by their promise as they might have failed to do under less imposing circumstances Some of them began instantly to leave others said 'Are we not to have one more hymn ' 'Yes ' answered their entertainer and she commenced to sing 'I bless the Lord I've got my seal to day and to day To slay Goliath in the field to day and to day The good old way is a righteous way I mean to take the kingdom in the good old way ' While singing she heard some enforcing obedience to their promise while a few seemed refusing to abide by it But before she had quite concluded she saw them turn from her and in the course of a few minutes they were running as fast as they well could in a solid body and she says she can compare them to nothing but a swarm of bees so dense was their phalanx so straight their course so hurried their march As they passed with a rush very near the stand of the other preachers the hearts of the people were smitten with fear thinking their entertainer had failed to enchain them longer with her spell and that they were coming upon them with redoubled and remorseless fury But they found they were mistaken and that their fears were groundless for before they could well recover from their surprise every rioter was gone and not one was left on the grounds or seen there again during the meeting Sojourner was informed that as her audience reached the main road some distance from the tents a few of the rebellious spirits refused to go on and proposed returning but their leaders said 'No we have promised to leave all promised and we must go all go and you shall none of you return again ' She did not fall in love at first sight with the Northampton Association for she arrived there at a time when appearances did not correspond with the ideas of associationists as they had been spread out in their writings for their phalanx was a factory and they were wanting in means to carry out their ideas of beauty and elegance as they would have done in different circumstances But she thought she would make an effort to tarry with them one night though that seemed to her no desirable affair But as soon as she saw that accomplished literary and refined persons were living in that plain and simple manner and submitting to the labors and privations incident to such an infant institution she said 'Well if these can live here I can ' Afterwards she gradually became pleased with and attached to the place and the people as well she might for it must have been no small thing to have found a home in a 'Community composed of some of the choicest spirits of the age ' where all was characterized by an equality of feeling a liberty of thought and speech and a largeness of soul she could not have before met with to the same extent in any of her wanderings Our first knowledge of her was derived from a friend who had resided for a time in the 'Community ' and who after describing her and singing one of her hymns wished that we might see her But we little thought at that time that we should ever pen these 'simple annals' of this child of nature When we first saw her she was working with a hearty good will saying she would not be induced to take regular wages believing as once before that now Providence had provided her with a never failing fount from which her every want might be perpetually supplied through her mortal life In this she had calculated too fast For the Associationists found that taking every thing into consideration they would find it most expedient to act individually and again the subject of this sketch found her dreams unreal and herself flung back upon her own resources for the supply of her needs This she might have found more inconvenient at her time of life for labor exposure and hardship had made sad inroads upon her iron constitution by inducing chronic disease and premature old age had she not remained under the shadow of one GEORGE W BENSON who never wearies in doing good giving to the needy and supplying the wants of the destitute She has now set her heart upon having a little home of her own even at this late hour of life where she may feel a greater freedom than she can in the house of another and where she can repose a little after her day of action has passed by And for such a 'home' she is now dependent on the charities of the benevolent and to them we appeal with confidence Through all the scenes of her eventful life may be traced the energy of a naturally powerful mind the fearlessness and child like simplicity of one untrammelled by education or conventional customs purity of character an unflinching adherence to principle and a native enthusiasm which under different circumstances might easily have produced another Joan of Arc With all her fervor and enthusiasm and speculation her religion is not tinctured in the least with gloom No doubt no hesitation no despondency spreads a cloud over her soul but all is bright clear positive and at times ecstatic Her trust is in God and from him she looks for good and not evil She feels that 'perfect love casteth out fear ' Having more than once found herself awaking from a mortifying delusion as in the case of the Sing Sing kingdom and resolving not to be thus deluded again she has set suspicion to guard the door of her heart and allows it perhaps to be aroused by too slight causes on certain subjects her vivid imagination assisting to magnify the phantoms of her fears into gigantic proportions much beyond their real size instead of resolutely adhering to the rule we all like best when it is to be applied to ourselves that of placing every thing we see to the account of the best possible motive until time and circumstance prove that we were wrong Where no good motive can be assigned it may become our duty to suspend our judgment till evidence can be had In the application of this rule it is an undoubted duty to exercise a commendable prudence by refusing to repose any important trust to the keeping of persons who may be strangers to us and whose trustworthiness we have never seen tried But no possible good but incalculable evil may and does arise from the too common practice of placing all conduct the source of which we do not fully understand to the worst of intentions How often is the gentle timid soul discouraged and driven perhaps to despondency by finding its 'good evil spoken of ' and a well meant but mistaken action loaded with an evil design If the world would but sedulously set about reforming itself on this one point who can calculate the change it would produce the evil it would annihilate and the happiness it would confer None but an all seeing eye could at once embrace so vast a result A result how desirable and one that can be brought about only by the most simple process that of every individual seeing to it that he commit not this sin himself For why should we allow in ourselves the very fault we most dislike when committed against us Shall we not at least aim at consistency Had she possessed less generous self sacrifice more knowledge of the world and of business matters in general and had she failed to take it for granted that others were like herself and would when her turn came to need do as she had done and find it 'more blessed to give than to receive ' she might have laid by something for the future For few perhaps have ever possessed the power and inclination in the same degree at one and the same time to labor as she has done both day and night for so long a period of time And had these energies been well directed and the proceeds well husbanded since she has been her own mistress they would have given her an independence during her natural life But her constitutional biases and her early training or rather want of training prevented this result and it is too late now to remedy the great mistake Shall she then be left to want Who will not answer 'No ' LAST INTERVIEW WITH HER MASTER In the spring of Sojourner made a visit to her eldest daughter Diana who has ever suffered from ill health and remained with Mr Dumont Isabella's humane master She found him still living though advanced in age and reduced in property as he had been for a number of years but greatly enlightened on the subject of slavery He said he could then see that 'slavery was the wickedest thing in the world the greatest curse the earth had ever felt that it was then very clear to his mind that it was so though while he was a slaveholder himself he did not see it so and thought it was as right as holding any other property ' Sojourner remarked to him that it might be the same with those who are now slaveholders 'O no ' replied he with warmth 'it cannot be For now the sin of slavery is so clearly written out and so much talked against why the whole world cries out against it that if any one says he don't know and has not heard he must I think be a liar In my slaveholding days there were few that spoke against it and these few made little impression on any one Had it been as it is now think you I could have held slaves No I should not have dared to do it but should have emancipated every one of them Now it is very different all may hear if they will ' Yes reader if any one feels that the tocsin of alarm or the anti slavery trump must sound a louder note before they can hear it one would think they must be very hard of hearing yea that they belong to that class of whom it may be truly said 'they have stopped their ears that they may not hear ' She received a letter from her daughter Diana dated Hyde Park December which informed her that Mr Dumont had 'gone West' with some of his sons that he had taken along with him probably through mistake the few articles of furniture she had left with him 'Never mind ' says Sojourner 'what we give to the poor we lend to the Lord ' She thanked the Lord with fervor that she had lived to hear her master say such blessed things She recalled the lectures he used to give his slaves on speaking the truth and being honest and laughing she says he taught us not to lie and steal when he was stealing all the time himself and did not know it Oh how sweet to my mind was this confession And what a confession for a master to make to a slave A slaveholding master turned to a brother Poor old man may the Lord bless him and all slaveholders partake of his spirit END OF THE NARRATIVE APPENDIX Extract from 'Slavery as It Is ' SLAVERY A SYSTEM OF INHERENT CRUELTY BY THEODORE D WELD THIRTY HUNDRED THOUSAND PERSONS in this country men women and children are in SLAVERY Is slavery as a condition for human beings good bad or indifferent We submit the question without argument You have common sense and conscience and a human heart pronounce upon it You have a wife or a husband a child a father a mother a brother or a sister make the case your own make it theirs and bring in your verdict The case of Human Rights against Slavery has been adjudicated in the court of conscience times innumerable The same verdict has always been rendered 'Guilty ' the same sentence has always been pronounced 'Let it be accursed ' and human nature with her million echoes has rung it round the world in every language under heaven 'Let it be accursed Let it be accursed ' His heart is false to human nature who will not say 'Amen ' There is not a man on earth who does not believe that slavery is a curse Human beings may be inconsistent but human nature is true to herself She has uttered her testimony against slavery with a shriek ever since the monster was begotten and till it perishes amidst the execrations of the universe she will traverse the world on its track dealing her bolts upon its head and dashing against it her condemning brand We repeat it every man knows that slavery is a curse Whoever denies this his lips libel his heart Try him clank the chains in his ears and tell him they are for him give him an hour to prepare his wife and children for a life of slavery bid him make haste and get ready their necks for the yoke and their wrists for the coffle chains then look at his pale lips and trembling knees and you have nature's testimony against slavery At least thirty hundred thousand persons in these States are in this condition They were made slaves and are held such by force and by being put in fear and this for no crime Reader what have you to say of such treatment Is it right just benevolent Suppose I should seize you rob you of your liberty drive you into the field and make you work without pay as long as you live would that be justice and kindness or monstrous injustice and cruelty Now every body knows that the slaveholders do these things to the slaves every day and yet it is stoutly affirmed that they treat them well and kindly and that their tender regard for their slaves restrains their masters from inflicting cruelties upon them We shall go into no metaphysics to show the absurdity of this pretence The man who robs you every day is forsooth quite too tender hearted ever to cuff or kick you True he can snatch your money but he does it gently lest he should hurt you He can empty your pockets without qualms but if your stomach is empty it cuts him to the quick He can make you work a life time without pay but loves you too well to let you go hungry He fleeces you of your rights with a relish but is shocked if you work bareheaded in summer or in winter without warm stockings He can make you go without your liberty but never without a shirt He can crush in you all hope of bettering your condition by vowing that you shall die his slave but though he can coolly torture your feelings he is too compassionate to lacerate your back he can break your heart but he is very tender of your skin He can strip you of all protection and thus expose you to all outrages but if you are exposed to the weather half clad and half sheltered how yearn his tender bowels What slaveholders talk of treating men well and yet not only rob them of all they get and as fast as they get it but rob them of themselves also their very hands and feet all their muscles and limbs and senses their bodies and minds their time and liberty and earnings their free speech and rights of conscience their right to acquire knowledge and property and reputation and yet they who plunder them of all these would fain make us believe that their soft hearts ooze out so lovingly toward their slaves that they always keep them well housed and well clad never push them too hard in the field never make their dear backs smart nor let their dear stomachs get empty But there is no end to these absurdities Are slaveholders dunces or do they take all the rest of the world to be that they think to bandage our eyes with such thin gauzes Protesting their kind regard for those whom they hourly plunder of all they have and all they get What when they have seized their victims and annihilated all their rights still claim to be the special guardians of their happiness Plunderers of their liberty yet the careful suppliers of their wants Robbers of their earnings yet watchful sentinels round their interests and kind providers for their comfort Filching all their time yet granting generous donations for rest and sleep Stealing the use of their muscles yet thoughtful of their ease Putting them under drivers yet careful that they are not hard pushed Too humane forsooth to stint the stomachs of their slaves yet force their minds to starve and brandish over them pains and penalties if they dare reach forth for the smallest crumb of knowledge even a letter of the alphabet It is no marvel that slaveholders are always talking of their kind treatment of their slaves The only marvel is that men of sense can be gulled by such professions Despots always insist that they are merciful The greatest tyrants that ever dripped with blood have assumed the titles of 'most gracious ' 'most clement ' 'most merciful ' c and have ordered their crouching vassals to accost them thus When did not vice lay claim to those virtues which are the opposites of its habitual crimes The guilty according to their own showing are always innocent and cowards brave and drunkards sober and harlots chaste and pickpockets honest to a fault Every body understands this When a man's tongue grows thick and he begins to hiccough and walk cross legged we expect him as a matter of course to protest that he is not drunk so when a man is always singing the praises of his own honesty we instinctively watch his movements and look out for our pocket books Whoever is simple enough to be hoaxed by such professions should never be trusted in the streets without somebody to take care of him Human nature works out in slaveholders just as it does in other men and in American slaveholders just as in English French Turkish Algerine Roman and Grecian The Spartans boasted of their kindness to their slaves while they whipped them to death by thousands at the altars of their gods The Romans lauded their own mild treatment of their bondsmen while they branded their names on their flesh with hot irons and when old threw them into their fish ponds or like Cato 'the Just ' starved them to death It is the boast of the Turks that they treat their slaves as though they were their children yet their common name for them is 'dogs ' and for the merest trifles their feet are bastinadoed to a jelly or their heads clipped off with a scimetar The Portuguese pride themselves on their gentle bearing towards their slaves yet the streets of Rio Janeiro are filled with naked men and women yoked in pairs to carts and wagons and whipped by drivers like beasts of burden Slaveholders the world over have sung the praises of their tender mercies towards their slaves Even the wretches that plied the African slave trade tried to rebut Clarkson's proofs of their cruelties by speeches affidavits and published pamphlets setting forth the accommodations of the 'middle passage ' and their kind attentions to the comfort of those whom they had stolen from their homes and kept stowed away under hatches during a voyage of four thousand miles So according to the testimony of the autocrat of the Russias he exercises great clemency towards the Poles though he exiles them by thousands to the snows of Siberia and tramples them down by millions at home Who discredits the atrocities perpetrated by Ovando in Hispaniola Pizarro in Peru and Cortez in Mexico because they filled the ears of the Spanish Court with protestations of their benignant rule While they were yoking the enslaved natives like beasts to the draught working them to death by thousands in their mines hunting them with bloodhounds torturing them on racks and broiling them on beds of coals their representations to the mother country teemed with eulogies of their parental sway The bloody atrocities of Philip II in the expulsion of his Moorish subjects are matters of imperishable history Who disbelieves or doubts them And yet his courtiers magnified his virtues and chanted his clemency and his mercy while the wail of a million victims smitten down by a tempest of fire and slaughter let loose at his bidding rose above the Te Deums that thundered from all Spain's cathedrals When Louis XIV revoked the edict of Nantes and proclaimed two millions of his subjects free plunder for persecution when from the English channel to the Pyrennees the mangled bodies of the Protestants were dragged on reeking hurdles by a shouting populace he claimed to be 'the father of his people ' and wrote himself 'His most Christian Majesty ' That slaves in the United States are treated with barbarous inhumanity that they are over worked under fed wretchedly clad and lodged and have insufficient sleep that they are often made to wear round their necks iron collars armed with prongs to drag heavy chains and weights at their feet while working in the field and to wear yokes and bells and iron horns that they are often kept confined in the stocks day and night for weeks together made to wear gags in their mouths for hours or days have some of their front teeth torn out or broken off that they may be easily detected when they run away that they are frequently flogged with terrible severity have red pepper rubbed into their lacerated flesh and hot brine spirits of turpentine c poured over the gashes to increase the torture that they are often stripped naked their backs and limbs cut with knives bruised and mangled by scores and hundreds of blows with the paddle and terribly torn by the claws of cats drawn over them by their tormentors that they are often hunted with bloodhounds and shot down like beasts or torn in pieces by dogs that they are often suspended by the arms and whipped and beaten till they faint and when revived by restoratives beaten again till they faint and sometimes till they die that their ears are often cut off their eyes knocked out their bones broken their flesh branded with red hot irons that they are maimed mutilated and burned to death over slow fires are undeniable facts The enormities inflicted by slaveholders upon their slaves will never be discredited except by those who overlook the simple fact that he who holds human beings as his bona fide property regards them as property and not as persons this is his permanent state of mind towards them He does not contemplate slaves as human beings consequently does not treat them as such and with entire indifference sees them suffer privations and writhe under blows which if inflicted upon whites would fill him with horror and indignation He regards that as good treatment of slaves which would seem to him insufferable abuse if practised upon others and would denounce that as a monstrous outrage and horrible cruelty if perpetrated upon white men and women which he sees every day meted out to black slaves without perhaps ever thinking it cruel Accustomed all his life to regard them rather as domestic animals to hear them stormed at and to see them cuffed and caned and being himself in constant habit of treating them thus such practices have become to him a mere matter of course and make no impression on his mind True it is incredible that men should treat as chattels those whom they truly regard as human beings but that they should treat as chattels and working animals those whom they regard as such is no marvel The common treatment of dogs when they are in the way is to kick them out of it we see them every day kicked off of sidewalks and on Sabbaths out of churches yet as they are but dogs these do not strike us as outrages yet if we were to see men women and children our neighbors and friends kicked out of stores by merchants or out of churches by the deacons and sexton we should call the perpetrators inhuman wretches We have said that slaveholders regard their slaves not as human beings but as mere working animals or merchandise The whole vocabulary of slaveholders their laws their usages and their entire treatment of their slaves fully establish this The same terms are applied to slaves that are given to cattle They are called 'stock ' So when the children of slaves are spoken of prospectively they are called their 'increase ' the same term that is applied to flocks and herds So the female slaves that are mothers are called 'breeders ' till past child bearing and often the same terms are applied to the different sexes that are applied to the males and females among cattle Those who compel the labor of slaves and cattle have the same appellation 'drivers ' the names which they call them are the same and similar to those given to their horses and oxen The laws of slave States make them property equally with goats and swine they are levied upon for debt in the same way they are included in the same advertisements of public sales with cattle swine and asses when moved from one part of the country to another they are herded in droves like cattle and like them urged on by drivers their labor is compelled in the same way They are bought and sold and separated like cattle when exposed for sale their good qualities are described as jockeys show off the good points of their horses their strength activity skill power of endurance c are lauded and those who bid upon them examine their persons just as purchasers inspect horses and oxen they open their mouths to see if their teeth are sound strip their backs to see if they are badly scarred and handle their limbs and muscles to see if they are firmly knit Like horses they are warranted to be 'sound ' or to be returned to the owner if 'unsound ' A father gives his son a horse and slave by his will he distributes among them his racehorses hounds game cocks and slaves We leave the reader to carry out the parallel which we have only begun Its details would cover many s That slaveholders do not practically regard slaves as human beings is abundantly shown by their own voluntary testimony In a recent work entitled 'The South Vindicated from the Treason and Fanaticism of Northern Abolitionists ' which was written we are informed by Colonel Dayton late member of Congress from South Carolina the writer speaking of the awe with which the slaves regard the whites says 'The Northerner looks upon a band of negroes as upon so many men but the planter or Southerner views them in a very different light ' Extract from a speech of Mr SUMMERS of Virginia in the Legislature of that State January See the Richmond Whig 'When in the sublime lessons of Christianity he the slaveholder is taught to do unto others as he would have others do unto him HE NEVER DREAMS THAT THE DEGRADED NEGRO IS WITHIN THE PALE OF THAT HOLY CANON ' PRESIDENT JEFFERSON in his letter to GOVERNOR COLES of Illinois dated August asserts that slaveholders regard their slaves as brutes in the following remarkable language 'Nursed and educated in the daily habit of seeing the degraded condition both bodily and mental of these unfortunate beings the slaves FEW MINDS HAVE YET DOUBTED BUT THAT THEY WERE AS LEGITIMATE SUBJECTS OF PROPERTY AS THEIR HORSES OR CATTLE ' Having shown that slaveholders regard their slaves as mere working animals and cattle we now proceed to show that their actual treatment of them is worse than it would be if they were brutes We repeat it SLAVEHOLDERS TREAT THEIR SLAVES WORSE THAN THEY DO THEIR BRUTES Whoever heard of cows or sheep being deliberately tied up and beaten and lacerated till they died or horses coolly tortured by the hour till covered with mangled flesh or of swine having their legs tied and being suspended from a tree and lacerated with thongs for hours or of hounds stretched and made fast at full length flayed with whips red pepper rubbed into their bleeding gashes and hot brine dashed on to aggravate the torture Yet just such forms and degrees of torture are daily perpetrated upon the slaves Now no man that knows human nature will marvel at this Though great cruelties have always been inflicted by men upon brutes yet incomparably the most horrid ever perpetrated have been those of men upon their own species Any leaf of history turned over at random has proof enough of this Every reflecting mind perceives that when men hold human beings as property they must from the nature of the case treat them worse than they treat their horses and oxen It is impossible for cattle to excite in men such tempests of fury as men excite in each other Men are often provoked if their horses or hounds refuse to do or their pigs refuse to go where they wish to drive them but the feeling is rarely intense and never permanent It is vexation and impatience rather than settled rage malignity or revenge If horses and dogs were intelligent beings and still held as property their opposition to the wishes of their owners would exasperate them immeasurably more than it would be possible for them to do with the minds of brutes None but little children and idiots get angry at sticks and stones that lie in their way or hurt them but put into sticks and stones intelligence and will and power of feeling and motion while they remain as now articles of property and what a towering rage would men be in if bushes whipped them in the face when they walked among them or stones rolled over their toes when they climbed hills and what exemplary vengeance would be inflicted upon door steps and hearth stones if they were to move out of their places instead of lying still where they were put for their owners to tread upon The greatest provocation to human nature is opposition to its will If a man's will be resisted by one far below him the provocation is vastly greater than when it is resisted by an acknowledged superior In the former case it inflames strong passions which in the latter lie dormant The rage of proud Haman knew no bounds against the poor Jew who would not do as he wished and so he built a gallows for him If the person opposing the will of another be so far below him as to be on a level with chattels and be actually held and used as an article of property pride scorn lust of power rage and revenge explode together upon the hapless victim The idea of property having a will and that too in opposition to the will of its owner and counteracting it is a stimulant of terrible power to the most relentless human passions and from the nature of slavery and the constitution of the human mind this fierce stimulant must with various degrees of strength act upon slaveholders almost without ceasing The slave however abject and crushed is an intelligent being he has a will and that will cannot be annihilated it will show itself if for a moment it is smothered like pent up fires when vent is found it flames the fiercer Make intelligence property and its manager will have his match he is met at every turn by an opposing will not in the form of downright rebellion and defiance but yet visibly an ever opposing will He sees it in the dissatisfied look and reluctant air and unwilling movement the constrained strokes of labor the drawling tones the slow hearing the feigned stupidity the sham pains and sickness the short memory and he feels it every hour in innumerable forms frustrating his designs by a ceaseless though perhaps invisible countermining This unceasing opposition to the will of its 'owner ' on the part of his rational 'property ' is to the slaveholder as the hot iron to the nerve He raves under it and storms gnashes and smites but the more he smites the hotter it gets and the more it burns him Further this opposition of the slave's will to his owner's not only excites him to severity that he may gratify his rage but makes it necessary for him to use violence in breaking down this resistance thus subjecting the slave to additional tortures There is another inducement to cruel inflictions upon the slave and a necessity for it which does not exist in the case of brutes Offenders must be made an example to others to strike them with terror If a slave runs away and is caught his master flogs him with terrible severity not merely to gratify his resentment and to keep him from running away again but as a warning to others So in every case of disobedience neglect stubbornness unfaithfulness indolence insolence theft feigned sickness when his directions are forgotten or slighted or supposed to be or his wishes crossed or his property injured or left exposed or his work ill executed the master is tempted to inflict cruelties not merely to wreak his own vengeance upon him and to make the slave more circumspect in future but to sustain his authority over the other slaves to restrain them from like practices and to preserve his own property A multitude of facts illustrating the position that slaveholders treat their slaves worse than they do their cattle will occur to all who are familiar with slavery When cattle break through their owners' inclosures and escape if found they are driven back and fastened in again and even slaveholders would execrate as a wretch the man who should tie them up and bruise and lacerate them for straying away but when slaves that have escaped are caught they are flogged with the most terrible severity When herds of cattle are driven to market they are suffered to go in the easiest way each by himself but when slaves are driven to market they are fastened together with handcuffs galled by iron collars and chains and thus forced to travel on foot hundreds of miles sleeping at night in their chains Sheep and sometimes horned cattle are marked with their owners' initials but this is generally done with paint and of course produces no pain Slaves too are often marked with their owners' initials but the letters are stamped into their flesh with a hot iron Cattle are suffered to graze their pastures without stint but the slaves are restrained in their food to a fixed allowance The slaveholders' horses are notoriously far better fed more moderately worked have fewer hours of labor and longer intervals of rest than their slaves and their valuable horses are far more comfortably housed and lodged and their stables more effectually defended from the weather than the slaves' huts These objectors can really believe the fact that in the city of New York less than a hundred years since thirteen persons were publicly burned to death over a slow fire and that the legislature of the same State took under its paternal care the African slave trade and declared that 'all encouragement should be given to the direct importation of slaves that all smuggling of slaves should be condemned as an eminent discouragement to the fair trader ' They do not call in question the fact that the African slave trade was carried on from the ports of the free States till within thirty years that even members of the Society of Friends were actively engaged in it shortly before the revolutionary war See Life and Travels of John Woolman that as late as no less than fifty nine of the vessels engaged in that trade were sent out from the little State of Rhode Island which had then only about seventy thousand inhabitants that among those most largely engaged in those foul crimes are the men whom the people of Rhode Island delight to honor that the man who dipped most deeply in that trade of blood James de Wolf and amassed a most princely fortune by it was not long since their Senator in Congress and another who was captain of one of his vessels was recently Lieutenant Governor of the State They can believe too all the horrors of the middle passage the chains suffocation maimings stranglings starvation and cold blooded murders atrocities perpetrated on board these slave ships by their own citizens perhaps by their own townsmen and neighbors possibly by their own fathers but O they 'can't believe that the slaveholders can be so hard hearted towards their slaves as to treat them with great cruelty ' They can believe that His Holiness the Pope with his cardinals bishops and priests have tortured broken on the wheel and burned to death thousands of Protestants that eighty thousand of the Anabaptists were slaughtered in Germany that hundreds of thousands of the blameless Waldenses Huguenots and Lollards were torn in pieces by the most titled dignitaries of church and state and that almost every professedly Christian sect has at some period of its history persecuted unto blood those who dissented from their creed They can believe also that in Boston New York Utica Philadelphia Cincinnati Alton and scores of other cities and villages of the free States 'gentlemen of property and standing ' led on by civil officers by members of State legislatures and of Congress by judges and attorneys general by editors of newspapers and by professed ministers of the gospel have organized mobs broken up lawful meetings of peaceable citizens committed assault and battery upon their persons knocked them down with stones led them about with ropes dragged them from their beds at midnight gagged and forced them into vehicles and driven them into unfrequented places and there tormented and disfigured them that they have rifled their houses made bonfires of their furniture in the streets burned to the ground or torn in pieces the halls or churches in which they were assembled attacked them with deadly weapons stabbed some shot others and killed one They can believe all this and further that a majority of the citizens in the places where these outrages have been committed connived at them and by refusing to indict the perpetrators or if they were indicted by combining to secure their acquittal and rejoicing in it have publicly adopted these felonies as their own All these things they can believe without hesitation and that they have even been done by their own acquaintances neighbors relatives perhaps those with whom they interchange courtesies those for whom they vote or to whose salaries they contribute but yet O they can never believe that slaveholders inflict cruelties upon their slaves They can give full credence to the kidnapping imprisonment and deliberate murder of WILLIAM MORGAN and that by men of high standing in society they can believe that this deed was aided and abetted and the murderers screened from justice by a large number of influential persons who were virtually accomplices either before or after the fact and that this combination was so effectual as successfully to defy and triumph over the combined powers of the government yet that those who constantly rob men of their time liberty and wages and all their rights should rob them of bits of flesh and occasionally of a tooth make their backs bleed and put fetters on their legs is too monstrous to be credited Further these same persons who 'can't believe' that slaveholders are so iron hearted as to ill treat their slaves believe that the very elite of these slaveholders those most highly esteemed and honored among them are continually daring each other to mortal conflict and in the presence of mutual friends taking deadly aim at each other's hearts with settled purpose to kill if possible That among the most distinguished Governors of slave States among their most celebrated judges senators and representatives in Congress there is hardly one who has not either killed or tried to kill or aided and abetted his friends in trying to kill one or more individuals That pistols dirks bowie knives or other instruments of death are generally carried throughout the slave States and that deadly affrays with them in the streets of their cities and villages are matters of daily occurrence that the sons of slaveholders in southern colleges bully threaten and fire upon their teachers and their teachers upon them that during the last summer in the most celebrated seat of science and literature in the South the University of Virginia the professors were attacked by more than seventy armed students and in the words of a Virginia paper were obliged 'to conceal themselves from their fury ' also that almost all the riots and violence that occur in northern colleges are produced by the turbulence and lawless passions of southern students That such are the furious passions of slaveholders no considerations of personal respect none for the proprieties of life none for the honor of our national legislature none for the character of our country abroad can restrain the slaveholding members of Congress from the most disgraceful personal encounters on the floor of our nation's legislature smiting their fists in each other's faces throttling and even kicking and trying to gouge each other that during the session of the Congress just closed no less than six slaveholders taking fire at words spoken in debate have either rushed at each other's throats or kicked or struck or attempted to knock each other down and that in all these instances they would doubtless have killed each other if their friends had not separated them Further they know full well these were not insignificant vulgar blackguards elected because they were the head bullies and bottle holders in a boxing ring or because their constituents went drunk to the ballot box but they were some of the most conspicuous members of the House one of them a former Speaker Our newspapers are full of these and similar daily occurrences among slaveholders copied verbatim from their own accounts of them in their own papers and all this we fully credit no man is simpleton enough to cry out 'O I can't believe that slaveholders do such things ' and yet when we turn to the treatment which these men mete out to their slaves and show that they are in the habitual practice of striking kicking knocking down and shooting them as well as each other the look of blank incredulity that comes over northern dough faces is a study for a painter and then the sentimental outcry with eyes and hands uplifted 'Oh indeed I can't believe the slaveholders are so cruel to their slaves ' Most amiable and touching charity Arbitrary power is to the mind what alcohol is to the body it intoxicates Man loves power It is perhaps the strongest human passion and the more absolute the power the stronger the desire for it and the more it is desired the more its exercise is enjoyed this enjoyment is to human nature a fearful temptation generally an over match for it Hence it is true with hardly an exception that arbitrary power is abused in proportion as it is desired The fact that a person intensely desires power over others without restraint shows the absolute necessity of restraint What woman would marry a man who made it a condition that he should have the power to divorce her whenever he pleased Oh he might never wish to exercise it but the power he would have No woman not stark mad would trust her happiness in such hands Would a father apprentice his son to a master who insisted that his power over the lad should be absolute The master might perhaps never wish to commit a battery upon the boy but if he should he insists upon having full swing He who would leave his son in the clutches of such a wretch would be bled and blistered for a lunatic as soon as his friends could get their hands upon him The possession of power even when greatly restrained is such a fiery stimulant that its lodgment in human hands is always perilous Give men the handling of immense sums of money and all the eyes of Argus and the hands of Briareus can hardly prevent embezzlement That American slaveholders possess a power over their slaves which is virtually absolute none will deny The following extracts from the laws of slave States are proofs sufficient 'The slave is ENTIRELY subject to the WILL of his master Louisiana Civil Code Art 'Slaves shall be deemed sold taken reputed and adjudged in law to be chattels personal in the hands of their owners and possessors and their executors administrators and assigns TO ALL INTENTS CONSTRUCTIONS AND PURPOSES WHATSOEVER ' Laws of South Carolina Brev Dig Prince's Digest c That they desire this absolute power is shown from the fact of their holding and exercising it and making laws to confirm and enlarge it That the desire to possess this power every tittle of it is intense is proved by the fact that slaveholders cling to it with such obstinate tenacity as well as by all their doings and sayings their threats cursings and gnashings against all who denounce the exercise of such power as usurpation and outrage and counsel its immediate abrogation From the nature of the case from the laws of mind such power so intensely desired griped with such a death clutch and with such fierce spurnings of all curtailment or restraint cannot but be abused Privations and inflictions must be its natural habitual products with ever and anon terror torture and despair let loose to do their worst upon their helpless victims Slaveholders organize themselves into a tribunal to adjudicate upon their own conduct and give us in their decisions their estimate of their own character informing us with characteristic modesty that they have a high opinion of themselves that in their own judgment they are very mild kind and merciful gentlemen In these conceptions of their own merits and of the eminent propriety of their bearing towards their slaves slaveholders remind us of the Spaniard who always took off his hat whenever he spoke of himself and of the Governor of Schiraz who from a sense of justice to his own character added to his other titles those of 'Flower of Courtesy ' 'Nutmeg of Consolation ' and 'Rose of Delight ' When men speak of the treatment of others as being either good or bad their declarations are not generally to be taken as testimony to matters of fact so much as expressions of their own feelings towards those persons or classes who are the subjects of such treatment If those persons are their fellow citizens if they are in the same class of society with themselves of the same language creed and color similar in their habits pursuits and sympathies they will keenly feel any wrong done to them and denounce it as base outrageous treatment but let the same wrongs be done to persons of a condition in all respects the reverse persons whom they habitually despise and regard only in the light of mere conveniences to be used for their pleasure and the idea that such treatment is barbarous will be laughed at as ridiculous When we hear slaveholders say that their slaves are well treated we have only to remember that they are not speaking of persons but of property not of men and women but of chattels and things not of friends and associates but of vassals and victims not of those whom they respect and honor but of those whom they scorn and trample on not of those with whom they sympathize and co operate and interchange courtesies but of those whom they regard with contempt and aversion and disdainfully set with the dogs of their flock Reader keep this fact in your mind and you will have a clue to the slaveholder's definition of 'good treatment ' CERTIFICATES OF CHARACTER

SEPARATION OF ELIZA AND HER LAST CHILD CHAPIN RESCUES SOLOMON FROM HANGING THE STAKING OUT AND FLOGGING OF THE GIRL PATSEY SCENE IN THE COTTON FIELD AND SOLOMON'S DELIVERY ARRIVAL HOME AND FIRST MEETING WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN xv EDITOR'S PREFACE When the editor commenced the preparation of the following narrative he did not suppose it would reach the size of this volume In order however to present all the facts which have been communicated to him it has seemed necessary to extend it to its present length Many of the statements contained in the following s are corroborated by abundant evidence others rest entirely upon Solomon's assertion That he has adhered strictly to the truth the editor at least who has had an opportunity of detecting any contradiction or discrepancy in his statements is well satisfied He has invariably repeated the same story without deviating in the slightest particular and has also carefully perused the manuscript dictating an alteration wherever the most trivial inaccuracy has appealed It was Solomon's fortune during his captivity to be owned by several masters The treatment he received while at the Pine Woods shows that among slaveholders there are men of humanity as well of cruelty Some of them are spoken of with emotions of gratitude others in a spirit of bitterness It is xvi believed that the following account of his experience on Bayou Boeuf presents a correct picture of Slavery in all its lights and shadows as it now exists in that locality Unbiased as he conceives by any prepossessions or prejudices the only object of the editor has been to give a faithful history of Solomon Northup's life as he received it from his lips In the accomplishment of that object he trusts he has succeeded notwithstanding the numerous faults of style and of expression it may be found to contain DAVID WILSON WHITEHALL N Y May NARRATIVE OF SOLOMON NORTHUP I INTRODUCTORY ANCESTRY THE NORTHUP FAMILY BIRTH AND PARENTAGE MINTUS NORTHUP MARRIAGE WITH ANNE HAMPTON GOOD RESOLUTIONS CHAMPLAIN CANAL RAFTING EXCURSION TO CANADA FARMING THE VIOLIN COOKING REMOVAL TO SARATOGA PARKER AND PERRY SLAVES AND SLAVERY THE CHILDREN THE BEGINNING OF SORROW Having been born a freeman and for more than thirty years enjoyed the blessings of liberty in a free State and having at the end of that time been kidnapped and sold into Slavery where I remained until happily rescued in the month of January after a bondage of twelve years it has been suggested that an account of my life and fortunes would not be uninteresting to the public Since my return to liberty I have not failed to perceive the increasing interest throughout the Northern States in regard to the subject of Slavery Works of fiction professing to portray its features in their more pleasing as well as more repugnant aspects have been circulated to an extent unprecedented and as I understand have created a fruitful topic of comment and discussion I can speak of Slavery only so far as it came under my own observation only so far as I have known and experienced it in my own person My object is to give a candid and truthful statement of facts to repeat the story of my life without exaggeration leaving it for others to determine whether even the s of fiction present a picture of more cruel wrong or a severer bondage As far back as I have been able to ascertain my ancestors on the paternal side were slaves in Rhode Island They belonged to a family by the name of Northup one of whom removing to the State of New York settled at Hoosic in Rensselaer county He brought with him Mintus Northup my father On the death of this gentleman which must have occurred some fifty years ago my father became free having been emancipated by a direction in his will Henry B Northup Esq of Sandy Hill a distinguished counselor at law and the man to whom under Providence I am indebted for my present liberty and my return to the society of my wife and children is a relative of the family in which my forefathers were thus held to service and from which they took the name I bear To this fact may be attributed the persevering interest he has taken in my behalf Sometime after my father's liberation he removed to the town of Minerva Essex county N Y where I was born in the month of July How long he remained in the latter place I have not the means of definitely ascertaining From thence he removed to Granville Washington county near a place known as Slyborough where for some years he labored on the farm of Clark Northup also a relative of his old master from thence he removed to the Alden farm at Moss Street a short distance north of the village of Sandy Hill and from thence to the farm now owned by Russel Pratt situated on the road leading from Fort Edward to Argyle where he continued to reside until his death which took place on the d day of November He left a widow and two children myself and Joseph an elder brother The latter is still living in the county of Oswego near the city of that name my mother died during the period of my captivity Though born a slave and laboring under the disadvantages to which my unfortunate race is subjected my father was a man respected for his industry and integrity as many now living who well remember him are ready to testify His whole life was passed in the peaceful pursuits of agriculture never seeking employment in those more menial positions which seem to be especially allotted to the children of Africa Besides giving us an education surpassing that ordinarily bestowed upon children in our condition he acquired by his diligence and economy a sufficient property qualification to entitle him to the right of suffrage He was accustomed to speak to us of his early life and although at all times cherishing the warmest emotions of kindness and even of affection towards the family in whose house he had been a bondsman he nevertheless comprehended the system of Slavery and dwelt with sorrow on the degradation of his race He endeavored to imbue our minds with sentiments of morality and to teach us to place our trust and confidence in Him who regards the humblest as well as the highest of his creatures How often since that time has the recollection of his paternal counsels occurred to me while lying in a slave hut in the distant and sickly regions of Louisiana smarting with the undeserved wounds which an inhuman master had inflicted and longing only for the grave which had covered him to shield me also from the lash of the oppressor In the church yard at Sandy Hill an humble stone marks the spot where he reposes after having worthily performed the duties appertaining to the lowly sphere wherein God had appointed him to walk Up to this period I had been principally engaged with my father in the labors of the farm The leisure hours allowed me were generally either employed over my books or playing on the violin an amusement which was the ruling passion of my youth It has also been the source of consolation since affording pleasure to the simple beings with whom my lot was cast and beguiling my own thoughts for many hours from the painful contemplation of my fate On Christmas day I was married to Anne Hampton a colored girl then living in the vicinity of our residence The ceremony was performed at Fort Edward by Timothy Eddy Esq a magistrate of that town and still a prominent citizen of the place She had resided a long time at Sandy Hill with Mr Baird proprietor of the Eagle Tavern and also in the family of Rev Alexander Proudfit of Salem This gentleman for many years had presided over the Presbyterian society at the latter place and was widely distinguished for his learning and piety Anne still holds in grateful remembrance the exceeding kindness and the excellent counsels of that good man She is not able to determine the exact line of her descent but the blood of three races mingles in her veins It is difficult to tell whether the red white or black predominates The union of them all however in her origin has given her a singular but pleasing expression such as is rarely to be seen Though somewhat resembling yet she cannot properly be styled a quadroon a class to which I have omitted to mention my mother belonged I had just now passed the period of my minority having reached the age of twenty one years in the month of July previous Deprived of the advice and assistance of my father with a wife dependent upon me for support I resolved to enter upon a life of industry and notwithstanding the obstacle of color and the consciousness of my lowly state indulged in pleasant dreams of a good time coming when the possession of some humble habitation with a few surrounding acres should reward my labors and bring me the means of happiness and comfort From the time of my marriage to this day the love I have borne my wife has been sincere and unabated and only those who have felt the glowing tenderness a father cherishes for his offspring can appreciate my affection for the beloved children which have since been born to us This much I deem appropriate and necessary to day in order that those who read these s may comprehend the poignancy of those sufferings I have been doomed to bear Immediately upon our marriage we commenced house keeping in the old yellow building then standing at the southern extremity of Fort Edward village and which has since been transformed into a modern mansion and lately occupied by Captain Lathrop It is known as the Fort House In this building the courts were sometime held after the organization of the county It was also occupied by Burgoyne in being situated near the old Fort on the left bank of the Hudson During the winter I was employed with others repairing the Champlain Canal on that section over which William Van Nortwick was superintendent David McEachron had the immediate charge of the men in whose company I labored By the time the canal opened in the spring I was enabled from the savings of my wages to purchase a pair of horses and other things necessarily required in the business of navigation Having hired several efficient hands to assist me I entered into contracts for the transportation of large rafts of timber from Lake Champlain to Troy Dyer Beckwith and a Mr Bartemy of Whitehall accompanied me on several trips During the season I became perfectly familiar with the art and mysteries of rafting a knowledge which afterwards enabled me to render profitable service to a worthy master and to astonish the simple witted lumbermen on the banks of the Bayou Boeuf In one of my voyages down Lake Champlain I was induced to make a visit to Canada Repairing to Montreal I visited the cathedral and other places of interest in that city from whence I continued my excursion to Kingston and other towns obtaining a knowledge of localities which was also of service to me afterwards as will appear towards the close of this narrative Having completed my contracts on the canal satisfactorily to myself and to my employer and not wishing to remain idle now that the navigation of the canal was again suspended I entered into another contract with Medad Gunn to cut a large quantity of wood In this business I was engaged during the winter of With the return of spring Anne and myself conceived the project of taking a farm in the neighborhood I had been accustomed from earliest youth to agricultural labors and it was an occupation congenial to my tastes I accordingly entered into arrangements for a part of the old Alden farm on which my father formerly resided With one cow one swine a yoke of fine oxen I had lately purchased of Lewis Brown in Hartford and other personal property and effects we proceeded to our new home in Kingsbury That year I planted twenty five acres of corn sowed large fields of oats and commenced farming upon as large a scale as my utmost means would permit Anne was diligent about the house affairs while I toiled laboriously in the field On this place we continued to reside until In the winter season I had numerous calls to play on the violin Wherever the young people assembled to dance I was almost invariably there Throughout the surrounding villages my fiddle was notorious Anne also during her long residence at the Eagle Tavern had become somewhat famous as a cook During court weeks and on public occasions she was employed at high wages in the kitchen at Sherrill's Coffee House We always returned home from the performance of these services with money in our pockets so that with fiddling cooking and farming we soon found ourselves in the possession of abundance and in fact leading a happy and prosperous life Well indeed would it have been for us had we remained on the farm at Kingsbury but the time came when the next step was to be taken towards the cruel destiny that awaited me In March we removed to Saratoga Springs We occupied a house belonging to Daniel O'Brien on the north side of Washington street At that time Isaac Taylor kept a large boarding house known as Washington Hall at the north end of Broadway He employed me to drive a hack in which capacity I worked for him two years After this time I was generally employed through the visiting season as also was Anne in the United States Hotel and other public houses of the place In winter seasons I relied upon my violin though during the construction of the Troy and Saratoga railroad I performed many hard days' labor upon it I was in the habit at Saratoga of purchasing articles necessary for my family at the stores of Mr Cephas Parker and Mr William Perry gentlemen towards whom for many acts of kindness I entertained feelings of strong regard It was for this reason that twelve years afterwards I caused to be directed to them the letter which is hereinafter inserted and which was the means in the hands of Mr Northup of my fortunate deliverance While living at the United States Hotel I frequently met with slaves who had accompanied their masters from the South They were always well dressed and well provided for leading apparently an easy life with but few of its ordinary troubles to perplex them Many times they entered into conversation with me on the subject of Slavery Almost uniformly I found they cherished a secret desire for liberty Some of them expressed the most ardent anxiety to escape and consulted me on the best method of effecting it The fear of punishment however which they knew was certain to attend their re capture and return in all cases proved sufficient to deter them from the experiment Having all my life breathed the free air of the North and conscious that I possessed the same feelings and affections that find a place in the white man's breast conscious moreover of an intelligence equal to that of some men at least with a fairer skin I was too ignorant perhaps too independent to conceive how any one could be content to live in the abject condition of a slave I could not comprehend the justice of that law or that religion which upholds or recognizes the principle of Slavery and never once I am proud to say did I fail to counsel any one who came to me to watch his opportunity and strike for freedom I continued to reside at Saratoga until the spring of The flattering anticipations which seven years before had seduced us from the quiet farm house on the east side of the Hudson had not been realized Though always in comfortable circumstances we had not prospered The society and associations at that world renowned watering place were not calculated to preserve the simple habits of industry and economy to which I had been accustomed but on the contrary to substitute others in their stead tending to shiftlessness and extravagance At this time we were the parents of three children Elizabeth Margaret and Alonzo Elizabeth the eldest was in her tenth year Margaret was two years younger and little Alonzo had just passed his fifth birth day They filled our house with gladness Their young voices were music in our ears Many an airy castle did their mother and myself build for the little innocents When not at labor I was always walking with them clad in their best attire through the streets and groves of Saratoga Their presence was my delight and I clasped them to my bosom with as warm and tender love as if their clouded skins had been as white as snow Thus far the history of my life presents nothing whatever unusual nothing but the common hopes and loves and labors of an obscure colored man making his humble progress in the world But now I had reached a turning point in my existence reached the threshold of unutterable wrong and sorrow and despair Now had I approached within the shadow of the cloud into the thick darkness whereof I was soon to disappear thenceforward to be hidden from the eyes of all my kindred and shut out from the sweet light of liberty for many a weary year II THE TWO STRANGERS THE CIRCUS COMPANY DEPARTURE FROM SARATOGA VENTRILOQUISM AND LEGERDEMAIN JOURNEY TO NEW YORK FREE PAPERS BROWN AND HAMILTON THE HASTE TO REACH THE CIRCUS ARRIVAL IN WASHINGTON FUNERAL OF HARRISON THE SUDDEN SICKNESS THE TORMENT OF THIRST THE RECEDING LIGHT INSENSIBILITY CHAINS AND DARKNESS ONE morning towards the latter part of the month of March having at that time no particular business to engage my attention I was walking about the village of Saratoga Springs thinking to myself where I might obtain some present employment until the busy season should arrive Anne as was her usual custom had gone over to Sandy Hill a distance of some twenty miles to take charge of the Culinary department at Sherrill's Coffee House during the session of the court Elizabeth I think had accompanied her Margaret and Alonzo were with their aunt at Saratoga On the corner of Congress street and Broadway near the tavern then and for aught I know to the contrary still kept by Mr Moon I was met by two gentlemen of respectable appearance both of whom were entirely unknown to me I have the impression that they were introduced to me by some one of my acquaintances but who I have in vain endeavored to recall with the remark that I was an expert player on the violin At any rate they immediately entered into conversation on that subject making numerous inquiries touching my proficiency in that respect My responses being to all appearances satisfactory they proposed to engage my services for a short period stating at the same time I was just such a person as their business required Their names as they afterwards gave them to me were Merrill Brown and Abram Hamilton though whether these were their true appellations I have strong reasons to doubt The former was a man apparently forty years of age somewhat short and thick set with a countenance indicating shrewdness and intelligence He wore a black frock coat and black hat and said he resided either at Rochester or at Syracuse The latter was a young man of fair complexion and light eyes and I should judge had not passed the age of twenty five He was tall and slender dressed in a snuff colored coat with glossy hat and vest of elegant pattern His whole apparel was in the extreme of fashion His appearance was somewhat effeminate but prepossessing and there was about him an easy air that showed he had mingled with the world They were connected as they informed me with a circus company then in the city of Washington that they were on their way thither to rejoin it having left it for a short time to make an excursion northward for the purpose of seeing the country and were paying their expenses by an occasional exhibition They also remarked that they had found much difficulty in procuring music for their entertainments and that if I would accompany them as far as New York they would give me one dollar for each day's services and three dollars in addition for every night I played at their performances besides sufficient to pay the expenses of my return from New York to Saratoga I at once accepted the tempting offer both for the reward it promised and from a desire to visit the metropolis They were anxious to leave immediately Thinking my absence would be brief I did not deem it necessary to write to Anne whither I had gone in fact supposing that my return perhaps would be as soon as hers So taking a change of linen and my violin I was ready to depart The carriage was brought round a covered one drawn by a pair of noble bays altogether forming an elegant establishment Their baggage consisting of three large trunks was fastened on the rack and mounting to the driver's seat while they took their places in the rear I drove away from Saratoga on the road to Albany elated with my new position and happy as I had ever been on any day in all my life We passed through Ballston and striking the ridge road as it is called if my memory correctly serves me followed it direct to Albany We reached that city before dark and stopped at a hotel southward from the Museum This night I had an opportunity of witnessing one of their performances the only one during the whole period I was with them Hamilton was stationed at the door I formed the orchestra while Brown provided the entertainment It consisted in throwing balls dancing on the rope frying pancakes in a hat causing invisible pigs to squeal and other like feats of ventriloquism and legerdemain The audience was extraordinarily sparse and not of the selectest character at that and Hamilton's report of the proceeds but a beggarly account of empty boxes Early next morning we renewed our journey The burden of their conversation now was the expression of an anxiety to reach the circus without delay They hurried forward without again stopping to exhibit and in due course of time we reached New York taking lodgings at a house on the west side of the city in a street running from Broadway to the river I supposed my journey was at an end and expected in a day or two at least to return to my friends and family at Saratoga Brown and Hamilton however began to importune me to continue with them to Washington They alleged that immediately on their arrival now that the summer season was approaching the circus would set out for the north They promised me a situation and high wages if I would accompany them Largely did they expatiate on the advantages that would result to me and such were the flattering representations they made that I finally concluded to accept the offer The next morning they suggested that inasmuch as we were about entering a slave State it would be well before leaving New York to procure free papers The idea struck me as a prudent one though I think it would scarcely have occurred to me had they not proposed it We proceeded at once to what I understood to be the Custom House They made oath to certain facts showing I was a free man A paper was drawn up and handed us with the direction to take it to the clerk's office We did so and the clerk having added something to it for which he was paid six shillings we returned again to the Custom House Some further formalities were gone through with before it was completed when paying the officer two dollars I placed the papers in my pocket and started with my two friends to our hotel I thought at the time I must confess that the papers were scarcely worth the cost of obtaining them the apprehension of danger to my personal safety never having suggested itself to me in the remotest manner The clerk to whom we were directed I remember made a memorandum in a large book which I presume is in the office yet A reference to the entries during the latter part of March or first of April I have no doubt will satisfy the incredulous at least so far as this particular transaction is concerned With the evidence of freedom in my possession the next day after our arrival in New York we crossed the ferry to Jersey City and took the road to Philadelphia Here we remained one night continuing our journey towards Baltimore early in the morning In due time we arrived in the latter city and stopped at a hotel near the railroad depot either kept by a Mr Rathbone or known as the Rathbone House All the way from New York their anxiety to reach the circus seemed to grow more and more intense We left the carriage at Baltimore and entering the cars proceeded to Washington at which place we arrived just at nightfall the evening previous to the funeral of General Harrison and stopped at Gadsby's Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue After supper they called me to their apartments and paid me forty three dollars a sum greater than my wages amounted to Which act of generosity was in consequence they said of their not having exhibited as often as they had given me to anticipate during our trip from Saratoga They moreover informed me that it had been the intention of the circus company to leave Washington the next morning but that on account of the funeral they had concluded to remain another day They were then as they had been from the time of our first meeting extremely kind No opportunity was omitted of addressing me in the language of approbation while on the other hand I was certainly much prepossessed in their favor I gave them my confidence without reserve and would freely have trusted them to almost any extent Their constant conversation and manner towards me their foresight in suggesting the idea of free papers and a hundred other little acts unnecessary to be repeated all indicated that they were friends indeed sincerely solicitous for my welfare I know not but they were I know not but they were innocent of the great wickedness of which I now believe them guilty Whether they were accessory to my misfortunes subtle and inhuman monsters in the shape of men designedly luring me away from home and family and liberty for the sake of gold those these read these s will have the same means of determining as myself If they were innocent my sudden disappearance must have been unaccountable indeed but revolving in my mind all the attending circumstances I never yet could indulge towards them so charitable a supposition After receiving the money from them of which they appeared to have an abundance they advised me not to go into the streets that night inasmuch as I was unacquainted with the customs of the city Promising to remember their advice I left them together and soon after was shown by a colored servant to a sleeping room in the back part of the hotel on the ground floor I laid down to rest thinking of home and wife and children and the long distance that stretched between us until I fell asleep But no good angel of pity came to my bedside bidding me to fly no voice of mercy forewarned me in my dreams of the trials that were just at hand The next day there was a great ant in Washington The roar of cannon and the tolling of bells filled the air while many houses were shrouded with crape and the streets were black with people As the day advanced the procession made its appearance coming slowly through the Avenue carriage after carriage in long succession while thousands upon thousands followed on foot all moving to the sound of melancholy music They were bearing the dead body of Harrison to the grave From early in the morning I was constantly in the company of Hamilton and Brown They were the only persons I knew in Washington We stood together as the funeral pomp passed by I remember distinctly how the window glass would break and rattle to the ground after each report of the cannon they were firing in the burial ground We went to the Capitol and walked a long time about the grounds In the afternoon they strolled towards the President's House all the time keeping me near to them and pointing out various places of interest As yet I had seen nothing of the circus In fact I had thought of it but little if at all amidst the excitement of the day My friends several times during the afternoon entered drinking saloons and called for liquor They were by no means in the habit however so far as I knew them of indulging to excess On these occasions after serving themselves they would pour out a glass and hand it to me I did not become intoxicated as may be inferred from what subsequently occurred Towards evening and soon after partaking of one of these potations I began to experience most unpleasant sensations I felt extremely ill My head commenced aching a dull heavy pain inexpressibly disagreeable At the supper table I was without appetite the sight and flavor of food was nauseous About dark the same servant conducted me to the room I had occupied the previous night Brown and Hamilton advised me to retire commiserating me kindly and expressing hopes that I would be better in the morning Divesting myself of coat and boots merely I threw myself upon the bed It was impossible to sleep The pain in my head continued to increase until it became almost unbearable In a short time I became thirsty My lips were parched I could think of nothing but water of lakes and flowing rivers of brooks where I had stooped to drink and of the dripping bucket rising with its cool and overflowing nectar from the bottom of the well Towards midnight as near as I could judge I arose unable longer to bear such intensity of thirst I was a stranger in the house and knew nothing of its apartments There was no one up as I could observe Groping about at random I knew not where I found the way at last to a kitchen in the basement Two or three colored servants were moving through it one of whom a woman gave me two glasses of water It afforded momentary relief but by the time I had reached my room again the same burning desire of drink the same tormenting thirst had again returned It was even more torturing than before as was also the wild pain in my head if such a thing could be I was in sore distress in most excruciating agony I seemed to stand on the brink of madness The memory of that night of horrible suffering will follow me to the grave In the course of an hour or more after my return from the kitchen I was conscious of some one entering my room There seemed to be several a mingling of various voices but how many or who they were I cannot tell Whether Brown and Hamilton were among them is a mere matter of conjecture I only remember with any degree of distinctness that I was told it was necessary to go to a physician and procure medicine and that pulling on my boots without coat or hat I followed them through a long passage way or alley into the open street It ran out at right angles from Pennsylvania Avenue On the opposite side there was a light burning in a window My impression is there were then three persons with me but it is altogether indefinite and vague and like the memory of a painful dream Going towards the light which I imagined proceeded from a physician's office and which seemed to recede as I advanced is the last glimmering recollection I can now recall From that moment I was insensible How long I remained in that condition whether only that night or many days and nights I do not know but when consciousness returned I found myself alone in utter darkness and in chains The pain in my head had subsided in a measure but I was very faint and weak I was sitting upon a low bench made of rough boards and without coat or hat I was hand cuffed Around my ankles also were a pair of heavy fetters One end of a chain was fastened to a large ring in the floor the other to the fetters on my ankles I tried in vain to stand upon my feet Waking from such a painful trance it was some time before I could collect my thoughts Where was I What was the meaning of these chains Where were Brown and Hamilton What had I done to deserve imprisonment in such a dungeon I could not comprehend There was a blank of some indefinite period preceding my awakening in that lonely place the events of which the utmost stretch of memory was unable to recall I listened intently for some sign or sound of life but nothing broke the oppressive silence save the clinking of my chains whenever I chanced to move I spoke aloud but the sound of my voice startled me I felt of my pockets so far as the fetters would allow far enough indeed to ascertain that I had not only been robbed of liberty but that my money and free papers were also gone Then did the idea begin to break upon my mind at first dim and confused that I had been kidnapped But that I thought was incredible There must have been some misapprehension some unfortunate mistake It could not be that a free citizen of New York who had wronged no man nor violated any law should be dealt with thus inhumanly The more I contemplated my situation however the more I became confirmed in my suspicions It was a desolate thought indeed I felt there was no trust or mercy in unfeeling man and commending myself to the God of the oppressed bowed my head upon my fettered hands and wept most bitterly III PAINFUL MEDITATIONS JAMES H BURCH WILLIAMS' SLAVE PEN IN WASHINGTON THE LACKEY RADRURN ASSERT MY FREEDOM THE ANGER OF THE TRADER THE PADDLE AND CAT O' NINETAILS THE WHIPPING NEW ACQUAINTANCES RAY WILLIAMS AND RANDALL ARRIVAL OF LITTLE EMILY AND HER MOTHER IN THE PEN MATERNAL SORROWS THE STORY OF ELIZA SOME three hours elapsed during which time I remained seated on the low bench absorbed in painful meditations At length I heard the crowing of a cock and soon a distant rumbling sound as of carriages hurrying through the streets came to my ears and I knew that it was day No ray of light however penetrated my prison Finally I heard footsteps immediately overhead as of some one walking to and fro It occurred to me then that I must be in an underground apartment and the damp mouldy odors of the place confirmed the supposition The noise above continued for at least an hour when at last I heard footsteps approaching from without A key rattled in the lock a strong door swung back upon its hinges admitting a flood of light and two men entered and stood before me One of them was a large powerful man forty years of age perhaps with dark chestnut colored hair slightly interspersed with gray His face was full his complexion flush his features grossly coarse expressive of nothing but cruelty and cunning He was about five feet ten inches high of full habit and without prejudice I must be allowed to say was a man whose whole appearance was sinister and repugnant His name was James H Burch as I learned afterwards a well known slave dealer in Washington and then or lately connected in business as a partner with Theophilus Freeman of New Orleans The person who accompanied him was a simple lackey named Ebenezer Radburn who acted merely in the capacity of turnkey Both of these men still live in Washington or did at the time of my return through that city from slavery in January last The light admitted through the open door enabled me to observe the room in which I was confined It was about twelve feet square the walls of solid masonry The floor was of heavy plank There was one small window crossed with great iron bars with an outside shutter securely fastened An iron bound door led into an adjoining cell or vault wholly destitute of windows or any means of admitting light The furniture of the room in which I was consisted of the wooden bench on which I sat an old fashioned dirty box stove and besides these in either cell there was neither bed nor blanket nor any other thing whatever The door through which Burch and Radburn entered led through a small passage up a flight of steps into a yard surrounded by a brick wall ten or twelve feet high immediately in rear of a building of the same width as itself The yard extended rearward from the house about thirty feet In one part of the wall there was a strongly ironed door opening into a narrow covered passage leading along one side of the house into the street The doom of the colored man upon whom the door leading out of that narrow passage closed was sealed The top of the wall supported one end of a roof which ascended inwards forming a kind of open shed Underneath the roof there was a crazy loft all round where slaves if so disposed might sleep at night or in inclement weather seek shelter from the storm It was like a farmer's barnyard in most respects save it was so constructed that the outside world could never see the human cattle that were herded there The building to which the yard was attached was two stories high fronting on one of the public streets of Washington Its outside presented only the appearance of a quiet private residence A stranger looking at it would never have dreamed of its execrable uses Strange as it may seem within plain sight of this same house looking down from its commanding height upon it was the Capitol The voices of patriotic representatives boasting of freedom and equality and the rattling of the poor slave's chains almost commingled A slave pen within the very shadow of the Capitol Such is a correct description as it was in of Williams' slave pen in Washington in one of the cellars of which I found myself so unaccountably confined Well my boy how do you feel now said Burch as he entered through the open door I replied that I was sick and inquired the cause of my imprisonment He answered that I was his slave that he had bought me and that he was about to send me to New Orleans I asserted aloud and boldly that I was a freeman a resident of Saratoga where I had a wife and children who were also free and that my name was Northup I complained bitterly of the strange treatment I had received and threatened upon my liberation to have satisfaction for the wrong He denied that I was free and with an emphatic oath declared that I came from Georgia Again and again I asserted I was no man's slave and insisted upon his taking off my chains at once He endeavored to hush me as if he feared my voice would be overheard But I would not be silent and denounced the authors of my imprisonment whoever they might be as unmitigated villains Finding he could not quiet me he flew into a towering passion With blasphemous oaths he called me a black liar a runaway from Georgia and every other profane and vulgar epithet that the most indecent fancy could conceive During this time Radburn was standing silently by His business was to oversee this human or rather inhuman stable receiving slaves feeding and whipping them at the rate of two shillings a head per day Turning to him Burch ordered the paddle and cat o' ninetails to be brought in He disappeared and in a few moments returned with these instruments of torture The paddle as it is termed in slave beating parlance or at least the one with which I first became acquainted and of which I now speak was a piece of hard wood board eighteen or twenty inches long moulded to the shape of an old fashioned pudding stick or ordinary oar The flattened portion which was about the size in circumference of two open hands was bored with a small auger in numerous places The cat was a large rope of many strands the strands unraveled and a knot tied at the extremity of each As soon as these formidable whips appeared I was seized by both of them and roughly divested of my clothing My feet as has been stated were fastened to the floor Drawing me over the bench face downwards Radburn placed his heavy foot upon the fetters between my wrists holding them painfully to the floor With the paddle Burch commenced beating me Blow after blow was inflicted upon my naked body When his unrelenting arm grew tired he stopped and asked if I still insisted I was a free man I did insist upon it and then the blows were renewed faster and more energetically if possible than before When again tired he would repeat the same question and receiving the same answer continue his cruel labor All this time the incarnate devil was uttering most fiendish oaths At length the paddle broke leaving the useless handle in his hand Still I would not yield All his brutal blows could not force from my lips the foul lie that I was a slave Casting madly on the floor the handle of the broken paddle he seized the rope This was far more painful than the other I struggled with all my power but it was in vain I prayed for mercy but my prayer was only answered with imprecations and with stripes I thought I must die beneath the lashes of the accursed brute Even now the flesh crawls upon my bones as I recall the scene I was all on fire My sufferings I can compare to nothing else than the burning agonies of hell At last I became silent to his repeated questions I would make no reply In fact I was becoming almost unable to speak Still he plied the lash without stint upon my poor body until it seemed that the lacerated flesh was stripped from my bones at every stroke A man with a particle of mercy in his soul would not have beaten even a dog so cruelly At length Radburn said that it was useless to whip me any more that I would be sore enough Thereupon Burch desisted saying with an admonitory shake of his fist in my face and hissing the words through his firm set teeth that if ever I dared to utter again that I was entitled to my freedom that I had been kidnapped or any thing whatever of the kind the castigation I had just received was nothing in comparison with what would follow He swore that he would either conquer or kill me With these consolatory words the fetters were taken from my wrists my feet still remaining fastened to the ring the shutter of the little barred window which had been opened was again closed and going out locking the great door behind them I was left in darkness as before In an hour perhaps two my heart leaped to my throat as the key rattled in the door again I who had been so lonely and who had longed so ardently to see some one I cared not who now shuddered at the thought of man's approach A human face was fearful to me especially a white one Radburn entered bringing with him on a tin plate a piece of shriveled fried pork a slice of bread and a cup of water He asked me how I felt and remarked that I had received a pretty severe flogging He remonstrated with me against the propriety of asserting my freedom In rather a patronizing and confidential manner he gave it to me as his advice that the less I said on that subject the better it would be for me The man evidently endeavored to appear kind whether touched at the sight of my sad condition or with the view of silencing on my part any further expression of my rights it is not necessary now to conjecture He unlocked the festers from my ankles opened the shutters of the little window and departed leaving me again alone By this time I had become stiff and sore my body was covered with blisters and it was with great pain and difficulty that I could move From the window I could observe nothing but the roof resting on the adjacent wall At night I laid down upon the damp hard floor without any pillow or covering whatever Punctually twice a day Radburn came in with his pork and bread and water I had but little appetite though I was tormented with continual thirst My wounds would not permit me to remain but a few minutes in any one position so sitting or standing or moving slowly round I passed the days and nights I was heart sick and discouraged Thoughts of my family of my wife and children continually occupied my mind When sleep overpowered me I dreamed of them dreamed I was again in Saratoga that I could see their faces and hear their voices calling me Awakening from the pleasant phantasms of sleep to the bitter realities around me I could but groan and weep Still my spirit was not broken I indulged the anticipation of escape and that speedily It was impossible I reasoned that men could be so unjust as to detain me as a slave when the truth of my case was known Burch ascertaining I was no runaway from Georgia would certainly let me go Though suspicions of Brown and Hamilton were not unfrequent I could not reconcile myself to the idea that they were instrumental to my imprisonment Surely they would seek me out they would deliver me from thraldom Alas I had not then learned the measure of man's inhumanity to man nor to what limitless extent of wickedness he will go for the love of gain In the course of several days the outer door was thrown open allowing me the liberty of the yard There I found three slaves one of them a lad of ten years the others young men of about twenty and twenty five I was not long in forming an acquaintance and learning their names and the particulars of their history The eldest was a colored man named Clemens Ray He had lived in Washington had driven a hack and worked in a livery stable there for a long time He was very intelligent and fully comprehended his situation The thought of going south overwhelmed him with grief Burch had purchased him a few days before and had placed him there until such time as he was ready to send him to the New Orleans market From him I learned for the first time that I was in William's Slave Pen a place I had never heard of previously He described to me the uses for which it was designed I repeated to him the particulars of my unhappy story but he could only give me the consolation of his sympathy He also advised me to be silent henceforth on the subject of my freedom for knowing the character of Burch he assured me that it would only be attended with renewed whip ping The next eldest was named John Williams He was raised in Virginia not far from Washington Burch had taken him in payment of a debt and he constantly entertained the hope that his master would redeem him a hope that was subsequently realized The lad was a sprightly child that answered to the name of Randall Most of the time he was playing about the yard but occasionally would cry calling for his mother and wondering when she would come His mother's absence seemed to be the great and only grief in his little heart He was too young to realize his condition and when the memory of his mother was not in his mind he amused us with his pleasant pranks At night Ray Williams and the boy slept in the loft of the shed while I was locked in the cell Finally we were each provided with blankets such as are used upon horses the only bedding I was allowed to have for twelve years afterwards Ray and Williams asked me many questions about New York how colored people were treated there how they could have homes and families of their own with none to disturb and oppress them and Ray especially sighed continually for freedom Such conversations however were not in the hearing of Burch or the keeper Radburn Aspirations such as these would have brought down the lash upon our backs It is necessary in this narrative in order to present a full and truthful statement of all the principal events in the history of my life and to portray the institution of Slavery as I have seen and known it to speak of well known places and of many persons who are yet living I am and always was an entire stranger in Washington and its vicinity aside from Burch and Radburn knowing no man there except as I have heard of them through my enslaved companions What I am about to say if false can be easily contradicted I remained in Williams slave pen about two weeks The night previous to my departure a woman was brought in weeping bitterly and leading by the hand a little child They were Randall's mother and half sister On meeting them he was overjoyed clinging to her dress kissing the child and exhibiting every demonstration of delight The mother also clasped him in her arms embraced him tenderly and gazed at him fondly through her tears calling him by many an endearing name Emily the child was seven or eight years old of light complexion and with a face of admirable beauty Her hair fell in curls around her neck while the style and richness of her dress and the neatness of her whole appearance indicated she had been brought up in the midst of wealth She was a sweet child indeed The woman also was arrayed in silk with rings upon her fingers and golden ornaments suspended from her ears Her air and manners the correctness and propriety of her language all showed evidently that she had sometime stood above the common level of a slave She seemed to be amazed at finding herself in such a place as that It was plainly a sudden and unexpected turn of fortune that had brought her there Filling the air with her complaining she was hustled with the children and myself into the cell Language can convey but an inadequate impression of the lamentations to which she gave incessant utterance Throwing herself upon the floor and encircling the children in her arms she poured forth such touching words as only maternal love and kindness can suggest They nestled closely to her as if there only was there any safety or protection At last they slept their heads resting upon her lap While they slumbered she smoothed the hair back from their little foreheads and talked to them all night long She called them her darlings her sweet babes poor innocent things that knew not the misery they were destined to endure Soon they would have no mother to comfort them they would be taken from her What would become of them Oh she could not live away from her little Emmy and her dear boy They had always been good children and had such loving ways It would break her heart God knew she said if they were taken from her and yet she knew they meant to sell them and may be they would be separated and could never see each other any more It was enough to melt heart of stone to listen to the pitiful expressions of that desolate and distracted mother Her name was Eliza and this was the story of her life as she afterwards related it She was the slave of a rich man living in the neighborhood of Washington She was born I think she said on his plantation Years before he had fallen into dissipated habits and quarreled with his wife In fact soon after the birth of Randall they separated Leaving his wife and daughter in the house they had always occupied he erected a new one nearby on the estate Into this house he brought Eliza and on condition of her living with him she and her children were to be emancipated She resided with him there nine years with servants to attend upon her and provided with every comfort and luxury of life Emily was his child Finally her young mistress who had always remained with her mother at the homestead married a Mr Jacob Brooks At length for some cause as I gathered from her relation beyond Berry's control a division of his property was made She and her children fell to the share of Mr Brooks During the nine years she had lived with Berry in consequence of the position she was compelled to occupy she and Emily had become the object of Mrs Berry and her daughter's hatred and dislike Berry himself she represented as a man of naturally a kind heart who always promised her that she should have her freedom and who she had no doubt would arrant it to her then if it were only in his power As soon as they thus came into the possession and control of the daughter it became very manifest they would not live long together The sight of Eliza seemed to be odious to Mrs Brooks neither could she bear to look upon the child half sister and beautiful as she was The day she was led into the pen Brooks had brought her from the estate into the city under pretence that the time had come when her free papers were to be executed in fulfillment of her master's promise Elated at the prospect of immediate liberty she decked herself and little Emmy in their best apparel and accompanied him with a joyful heart On their arrival in the city instead of being baptized into the family of freemen she was delivered to the trader Burch The paper that was executed was a bill of sale The hope of years was blasted in a moment From the hight of most exulting happiness to the utmost depths of wretchedness she had that day descended No wonder that she wept and filled the pen with wailings and expressions of heart rending woe Eliza is now dead Far up the Red River where it pours its waters sluggishly through the unhealthy low lands of Louisiana she rests in the grave at last the only resting place of the poor slave How all her fears were realized how she mourned day and night and never would be comforted how as she predicted her heart did indeed break with the burden of maternal sorrow will be seen as the narrative proceeds IV ELIZA'S SORROWS PREPARATION TO EMBARK DRIVEN THROUGH THE STREET'S OF WASHINGTON HALL COLUMBIA THE TOMB OF WASHINGTON CLEM RAY THE BREAKFAST ON THE STEAMER THE HAPPY BIRDS AQUIA CREEK FREDERICKSBURG ARRIVAL IN RICHMOND GOODIN AND HIS SLAVE PEN ROBERT OF CINCINNATI DAVID AND HIS WIFE MARY AND LETHE CLEM'S RETURN HIS SUBSEQUENT ESCAPE TO CANADA THE BRIG ORLEANS JAMES H BURCH AT intervals during the first night of Eliza's incarceration in the pen she complained bitterly of Jacob Brook's her young mistress' husband She declared that had she been aware of the deception he intended to practice upon her he never would have brought her there alive They had chosen the opportunity of getting her away when Master Berry was absent from the plantation He had always been kind to her She wished that she could see him but she knew that even he was unable now to rescue her Then would she commence weeping again kissing the sleeping children talking first to one then to the other as they lay in their unconscious slumbers with their heads upon her lap So wore the long night away and when the morning dawned and night had come again still she kept mourning on and would not be consoled About midnight following the cell door opened and Burch and Radburn entered with lanterns in their hands Burch with an oath ordered us to roll up our blankets without delay and get ready to go on board tile boat He swore we would be left unless we hurried fast He aroused the children from their slumbers with a rough shake and said they were d d sleepy it appeared Going out into the yard he called Clem Ray ordering him to leave the loft and come into the cell and bring his blanket with him When Clem appeared he placed us side by side and fastened us together with hand cuffs my left hand to his right John Williams had been taken out a day or two before his master having redeemed him greatly to his delight Clem and I were ordered to march Eliza and the children following We were conducted into the yard from thence into the covered passage and up a flight of steps through a side door into the upper room where I had heard the walking to and fro Its furniture was a stove a few old chairs and a long table covered with papers It was a white washed room without any carpet on the floor and seemed a sort of office By one of the windows I remember hung a rusty sword which attracted my attention Burch's trunk was there In obedience to his orders I took hold of one of its handles with my unfettered hand while he taking hold of the other we proceeded out of the front door into the street in the same order as we had left the cell It was a dark night All was quiet I could see lights or the reflection of them over towards Pennsylvania Avenue but there was no one not even a straggler to be seen I was almost resolved to attempt to break away Had I not been hand cuffed the attempt would certainly have been made whatever consequence might have followed Radburn was in the rear carrying a large stick and hurrying up the children as fast as the little ones could walk So we passed hand cuffed and in silence through the streets of Washington through the Capital of a nation whose theory of government we are told rests on the foundation of man's inalienable right to life LIBERTY and the pursuit of happiness Hail Columbia happy land indeed Reaching the steamboat we were quickly hustled into the hold among barrels and boxes of freight A colored servant brought a light the bell rung and soon the vessel started down the Potomac carrying us we knew not where The bell tolled as we passed the tomb of Washington Burch no doubt with uncovered head bowed reverently before the sacred ashes of the man who devoted his illustrious life to the liberty of his country None of us slept that night but Randall and little Emmy For the first time Clem Ray was wholly overcome To him the idea of going south was terrible in the extreme He was leaving the friends and associations of his youth every thing that was dear and precious to his heart in all probability never to return He and Eliza mingled their tears together bemoaning their cruel fate For my own part difficult as it was I endeavored to keep up my spirits I resolved in my mind a hundred plans of escape and fully determined to make the attempt the first desperate chance that offered I had by this time become satisfied however that my true policy was to say nothing further on the subject of my having been born a freeman It would but expose me to mal treatment and diminish the chances of liberation After sunrise in the morning we were called up on deck to breakfast Burch took our hand cuffs off and we sat down to table He asked Eliza if she would take a dram She declined thanking him politely During the meal we were all silent not a word passed between us A mulatto woman who served at table seemed to take an interest in our behalf told us to cheer up and not to be so cast down Breakfast over the hand cuffs were restored and Burch ordered us out on the stern deck We sat down together on some boxes still saying nothing in Burch's presence Occasionally a passenger would walk out to where we were look at us for a while then silently return It was a very pleasant morning The fields along the river were covered with verdure far in advance of what I had been accustomed to see at that season of the year The sun shone out warmly the birds were singing in the trees The happy birds I envied them I wished for wings like them that I might cleave the air to where my birdlings waited vainly for their father's coming in the cooler region of the North In the forenoon the steamer reached Aquia Creek There the passengers took stages Burch and his five slaves occupying one exclusively He laughed with the children and at one stopping place went so far as to purchase them a piece of gingerbread He told me to hold up my head and look smart That I might perhaps get a good master if I behaved myself I made him no reply His face was hateful to me and I could not bear to look upon it I sat in the corner cherishing in my heart the hope not yet extinct of some day meeting the tyrant on the soil of my native State At Fredericksburgh we were transferred from the stage coach to a car and before dark arrived in Richmond the chief city of Virginia At this city we were taken from the cars and driven through the street to a slave pen between the railroad depot and the river kept by a Mr Goodin This pen is similar to Williams' in Washington except it is somewhat larger and besides there were two small houses standing at opposite corners within the yard These houses are susually found within slave yards being used as rooms for the examination of human chattels by purchasers before concluding a bargain Unsoundness in a slave as well as in a horse detracts materially from his value If no warranty is given a close examination is a matter of particular importance to the negro jockey We were met at the door of Goodin's yard by that gentleman himself a short fat man with a round plump face black hair and whiskers and a complexion almost as dark as some of his own negroes He had a hard stern look and was perhaps about fifty years of age Burch and he met with great cordiality They were evidently old friends Shaking each other warmly by the hand Burch remarked he had brought some company inquired at what time the brig would leave and was answered that it would probably leave the next day at such an hour Goodin then turned to me took hold of my arm turned me partly round looked at me sharply with the air of one who considered himself a good judge of property and as if estimating in his own mind about how much I was worth Well boy where did you come from Forgetting myself for a moment I answered From New York New York H l what have you been doing up there was his astonished interrogatory Observing Burch at this moment looking at me with an angry expression that conveyed a meaning it was not difficult to understand I immediately said O I have only been up that way a piece in a manner intended to imply that although I might have been as far as New York yet I wished it distinctly understood that I did not belong to that free State nor to any other Goodin then turned to Clem and then to Eliza and the children examining them severally and asking various questions He was pleased with Emily as was every one who saw the child's sweet countenance She was not as tidy as when I first beheld her her hair was now somewhat disheveled but through its unkempt and soft profusion there still beamed a little face of most surpassing loveliness Altogether we were a fair lot a devilish good lot he said enforcing that opinion with more than one emphatic adjective not found in the Christian vocabulary Thereupon we passed into the yard Quite a number of slaves as many as thirty I should say were moving about or sitting on benches under the shed They were all cleanly dressed the men with hats the women with handkerchiefs tied about their heads Burch and Goodin after separating from us walked up the steps at the back part of the main building and sat down upon the door sill They entered into conversation but the subject of it I could not hear Presently Burch came down into the yard unfettered me and led me into one of the small houses You told that man you came from New York said he I replied I told him I had been up as far as New York to be sure but did not tell him I belonged there nor that I was a freeman I meant no harm at all Master Burch I would not have said it had I thought He looked at me a moment as if he was ready to devour me then turning round went out In a few minutes he returned If ever I hear you say a word about New York or about your freedom I will be the death of you I will kill you you may rely on that he ejaculated fiercely I doubt not he understood then better than I did the danger and the penalty of selling a free man into slavery He felt the necessity of closing my mouth against the crime he knew he was committing Of course my life would not have weighed a feather in any emergency requiring such a sacrifice Undoubtedly he meant precisely what he said Under the shed on one side of the yard there was constructed a rough table while overhead were sleeping lofts the same as in the pen at Washington After partaking at this table of our supper of pork and bread I was hand cuffed to a large yellow man quite stout and fleshy with a countenance expressive of the utmost melancholy He was a man of intelligence and information Chained together it was not long before we became acquainted with each other's history His name was Robert Like myself he had been born free and had a wife and two children in Cincinnati He said he had come south with two men who had hired him in the city of his residence Without free papers he had been seized at Fredericksburgh placed in confinement and beaten until he had learned as I had the necessity and the policy of silence He had been in Goodin's pen about three weeks To this man I became much attached We could sympathize with and understand each other It was with tears and a heavy heart not many days subsequently that I saw him die and looked for the last time upon his lifeless form Robert and myself with Clem Eliza and her children slept that night upon our blankets in one of the small houses in the yard There were four others all from the same plantation who had been sold and were now on their way south who also occupied it with us David and his wife Caroline both mulattos were exceedingly affected They dreaded the thought of being put into the cane and cotton fields but their greatest source of anxiety was the apprehension of being separated Mary a tall lithe girl of a most jetty black was listless and apparently indifferent Like many of the class she scarcely knew there was such a word as freedom Brought up in the ignorance of a brute she possessed but little more than a brute's intelligence She was one of those and there are very many who fear nothing but their master's lash and know no further duty than to obey his voice The other was Lethe She was of an entirely different character She had long straight hair and bore more the appearance of an Indian than a negro woman She had sharp and spiteful eyes and continually gave utterance to the language of hatred and revenge Her husband had been sold She knew not where she was An exchange of masters she was sure could not be for the worse She cared not whither they might carry her Pointing to the scars upon her face the desperate creature wished that she might see the day when she could wipe them off in some man's blood While we were thus learning the history of each other's wretchedness Eliza was seated in a corner by herself singing hymns and praying for her children Wearied from the loss of so much sleep I could no longer bear up against the advances of that sweet restorer and laying down by the side of Robert on the floor soon forgot my troubles and slept until the dawn of day In the morning having swept the yard and washed ourselves under Goodin's superintendence we were ordered to roll up our blankets and make ready for the continuance of our journey Clem Ray was informed that he would go no further Burch for some cause having concluded to carry him back to Washington He was much rejoiced Shaking hands we parted in the slave pen at Richmond and I have not seen him since But much to my surprise since my return I learned that he had escaped from bondage and on his way to the free soil of Canada lodged one night at the house of my brother in law in Saratoga informing my family of the place and the condition in which he left me In the afternoon we were drawn up two abreast Robert and myself in advance and in this order driven by Burch and Goodin from the yard through the streets of Richmond to the brig Orleans She was a vessel of respectable size full rigged and freighted principally with tobacco We were all on board by five o'clock Burch brought us each a tin cup and a spoon There were forty of us in the brig being all except Clem that were in the pen With a small pocket knife that had not been taken from me I began cutting the initials of my name upon the tin cup The others immediately flocked round me requesting me to mark theirs in a similar manner In time I gratified them all of which they did not appear to be forgetful We were all stowed away in the hold at night and the hatch barred down We laid on boxes or where ever there was room enough to stretch our blankets on the floor Burch accompanied us no farther than Richmond returning from that point to the capital with Clem Not until the lapse of almost twelve years to wit in January last in the Washington police office did I set my eyes upon his face again James H Burch was a slave trader buying men women and children at low prices and selling them at an advance He was a speculator in human flesh a disreputable calling and so considered at the South For the present he disappears from the scenes recorded in this narrative but he will appear again before its close not in the character of a man whipping tyrant but as an arrested cringing criminal in a court of law that failed to do him justice V ARRIVAL AT NORFOLK FREDERICK AND MARIA ARTHUR THE FREEMAN APPOINTED STEWARD JIM CUFFEE AND JENNY THE STORM BAHAMA BANKS THE CALM THE CONSPIRACY THE LONG BOAT THE SMALL POX DEATH OF ROBERT MANNING THE SAILOR THE MEETING IN THE FORECASTLE THE LETTER ARRIVAL AT NEW ORLEANS ARTHUR'S RESCUE THEOPHILUS FREEMAN THE CONSIGNEE PLATT FIRST NIGHT IN THE NEW ORLEANS SLAVE PEN AFTER we were all on board the brig Orleans proceeded down James River Passing into Chesapeake Bay we arrived next day opposite the city of Norfolk While lying at anchor a lighter approached us from the town bringing four more slaves Frederick a boy of eighteen had been born a slave as also had Henry who was some years older They had both been house servants in the city Maria was a rather genteel looting colored girl with a faultless form but ignorant and extremely vain The idea of going to New Orleans was pleasing to her She entertained an extravagantly high opinion of her own attractions Assuming a haughty mien she declared to her companions that immediately on our arrival in New Orleans she had no doubt some wealthy single gentleman of good taste would purchase her at once But the most prominent of the four was as a man named Arthur As the lighter approached he struggled stoutly with his keepers It was with main force that he was dragged aboard the brig He protested in a loud voice against the treatment he was receiving and demanded to be released His face was swollen and covered with wounds and bruises and indeed one side of it was a complete raw sore He was forced with all haste down the hatchway into the hold I caught an outline of his story as he was borne struggling along of which he afterwards gave me a more full relation and it was as follows He had long resided in the city of Norfolk and was a free man He had a family living there and was a mason by trade Having been unusually detained he was returning late one night to his house in the suburbs of the city when he was attacked by a gang of persons in an unfrequented street He fought until his strength failed him Overpowered at last he was gagged and bound with ropes and beaten until he became insensible For several days they secreted him in the slave pen at Norfolk a very common establishment it appears in the cities of the South The night before he had been taken out and put on board the lighter which pushing out from shore had awaited our arrival For some time he continued his protestations and was altogether irreconcilable At length however he became silent He sank into a gloomy and thoughtful mood and appeared to be counseling with himself There was in the man's determined face something that suggested the thought of desperation After leaving Norfolk the hand cuffs were taken off and during the day we were allowed to remain on deck The captain selected Robert as his waiter and I was appointed to superintend the cooking department and the distribution of food and water I had three assistants Jim Cuffee and Jenny Jenny's business was to prepare the coffee which consisted of corn meal scorched in a kettle boiled and sweetened with molasses Jim and Cuffee baked the hoe cake and boiled the bacon Standing by a table formed of a wide board resting on the heads of the barrels I cut and handed to each a slice of meat and a dodger of the bread and from Jenny's kettle also dipped out for each a cup of the coffee The use of plates was dispensed with and their sable fingers took the place of knives and forks Jim and Cuffee were very demure and attentive to business somewhat inflated with their situation as second cooks and without doubt feeling that there was a great responsibility resting on them I was called steward a name given me by the captain The slaves were fed twice a day at ten and five o'clock always receiving the same kind and quantity of fare and in the same manner as above described At night we were driven into the hold and securely fastened down Scarcely were we out of sight of land before we were overtaken by a violent storm The brig rolled and plunged until we feared she would go down Some were sea sick others on their knees praying while some were fast holding to each other paralyzed with fear The sea sickness rendered the place of our confinement loathsome and disgusting It would have been a happy thing for most of us it would have saved the agony of many hundred lashes and miserable deaths at last had the compassionate sea snatched us that day from the clutches of remorseless men The thought of Randall and little Emmy sinking down among the monsters of the deep is a more pleasant contemplation than to think of them as they are now perhaps dragging out lives of unrequited toil When in sight of the Bahama Banks at a place called Old Point Compass or the Hole in the Wall we were becalmed three days There was scarcely a breath of air The waters of the gulf presented a singularly white appearance like lime water In the order of events I come now to the relation of an occurrence which I never call to mind but with sensations of regret I thank God who has since permitted me to escape from the thralldom of slavery that through his merciful interposition I was prevented from imbruing my hands in the blood of his creatures Let not those who have never been placed in like circumstances judge me harshly Until they have been chained and beaten until they find themselves in the situation I was borne away from home and family towards a land of bondage let them refrain from saying what they would not do for liberty How far I should have been justified in the sight of God and man it is unnecessary now to speculate upon It is enough to say that I am able to congratulate myself upon the harmless termination of an affair which threatened for a time to be attended with serious results Towards evening on the first day of the calm Arthur and myself were in the bow of the vessel seated on the windlass We were conversing together of the probable destiny that awaited us and mourning together over our misfortunes Arthur said and I agreed with him that death was far less terrible than the living prospect that was before us For a long time we talked of our children our past lives and of the probabilities of escape Obtaining possession of the brig was suggested by one of us We discussed the possibility of our being able in such an event to make our way to the harbor of New York I knew little of the compass but the idea of risking the experiment was eagerly entertained The chances for and against us in an encounter with the crew was canvassed Who could be relied upon and who could not the proper time and manner of the attack were all talked over and over again From the moment the plot suggested itself I began to hope I revolved it constantly in my mind As difficulty after difficulty arose some ready conceit was at hand demonstrating how it could be overcome While others slept Arthur and I were maturing our plans At length with much caution Robert was gradually made acquainted with our intentions He approved of them at once and entered into the conspiracy with a zealous spirit There was not another slave we dared to trust Brought up in fear and ignorance as they are it can scarcely be conceived how servilely they will cringe before a white man's look It was not safe to deposit so bold a secret with any of them and finally we three resolved to take upon ourselves alone the fearful responsibility of the attempt At night as has been said we were driven into the hold and the hatch barred down How to reach the deck was the first difficulty that presented itself On the bow of the brig however I had observed the small boat lying bottom upwards It occurred to me that by secreting ourselves underneath it we would not be missed from the crowd as they were hurried down into the hold at night I was selected to make the experiment in order to satisfy ourselves of its feasibility The next evening accordingly after supper watching my opportunity I hastily concealed myself beneath it Lying close upon the deck I could see what was going on around me while wholly unperceived myself In the morning as they came up I slipped from my hiding place without being observed The result was entirely satisfactory The captain and mate slept in the cabin of the former From Robert who had frequent occasion in his capacity of waiter to make observations in that quarter we ascertained the exact position of their respective berths He further informed us that there were always two pistols and a cutlass lying on the table The crew's cook slept in the cook galley on deck a sort of vehicle on wheels that could be moved about as convenience required while the sailors numbering only six either slept in the forecastle or in hammocks swung among the rigging Finally our arrangements were all completed Arthur and I were to steal silently to the captain's cabin seize the pistols and cutlass and as quickly as possible despatch him and the mate Robert with a club was to stand by the door leading from the deck down into the cabin and in case of necessity beat back the sailors until we could hurry to his assistance We were to proceed then as circumstances might require Should the attack be so sudden and successful as to prevent resistance the hatch was to remain barred down otherwise the slaves were to be called up and in the crowd d and hurry and confusion of the time we resolved to regain our liberty or lose our lives I was then to assume the unaccustomed place of pilot and steering northward we trusted that some lucky wind might bear us to the soil of freedom The mate's name was Biddee the captain's I cannot now recall though I rarely ever forget a name once heard The captain was a small genteel man erect and prompt with a proud bearing and looked the personification of courage If he is still living and these s should chance to meet his eye he will learn a fact connected with the voyage of the brig from Richmond to New Orleans in not entered on his log book We were all prepared and impatiently waiting an opportunity of putting our designs into execution when they were frustrated by a sad and unforeseen event Robert was taken ill It was soon announced that he had the small pox He continued to grow worse and four days previous to our arrival in New Orleans he died One of the sailors sewed him in his blanket with a large stone from the ballast at his feet and then laying him on a hatchway and elevating it with tackles above the railing the inanimate body of poor Robert was consigned to the white waters of the gulf We were all panic stricken by the appearance of the small pox The captain ordered lime to be scattered through the hold and other prudent precautions to be taken The death of Robert however and the presence of the malady oppressed me sadly and I gazed out over the great waste of waters with a spirit that was indeed disconsolate An evening or two after Robert's burial I was leaning on the hatchway near the forecastle full of desponding thoughts when a sailor in a kind voice asked me why I was so down hearted The tone and manner of the man assured me and I answered because I was a freeman and had been kidnapped He remarked that it was enough to make any one down hearted and continued to interrogate me until he learned the particulars of my whole history He was evidently much interested in my behalf and in the blunt speech of a sailor swore he would aid me all he could if it split his timbers I requested him to furnish me pen ink and paper in order that I might write to some of my friends He promised to obtain them but how I could use them undiscovered was a difficulty If I could only get into the forecastle while his watch was off and the other sailors asleep the thing could be accomplished The small boat instantly occurred to me He thought we were not far from the Balize at the mouth of the Mississippi and it was necessary that the letter be written soon or the opportunity would be lost Accordingly by arrangement I managed the next night to secret myself again under the long boat His watch was off at twelve I saw him pass into the forecastle and in about an hour followed him He was nodding over a table half asleep on which a sickly light was flickering and on which also was a pen and sheet of paper As I entered he aroused beckoned me to a seat beside him and pointed to the paper I directed the letter to Henry B Northup of Sandy Hill stating that I had been kidnapped was then on board the brig Orleans bound for New Orleans that it was then impossible for me to conjecture my ultimate destination and requesting he would take measures to rescue me The letter was sealed and directed and Manning having read it promised to deposit it in the New Orleans post office I hastened back to my place under the long boat and in the morning as the slaves came up and were walking round crept out unnoticed and mingled with them My good friend whose name was John Manning was an Englishman by birth and a noble hearted generous sailor as ever walked a deck He had lived in Boston was a tall well built man about twenty four years old with a face somewhat pock marked but full of benevolent expression Nothing to vary the monotony of our daily life occurred until we reached New Orleans On coming to the levee and before the vessel was made fast I saw Manning leap on shore and hurry away into the city As he started off he looked back over his shoulder significantly giving me to understand the object of his errand Presently he returned and passing close by me hunched me with his elbow with a peculiar wink as much as to say it is all right The letter as I have since learned reached Sandy Hill Mr Northup visited Albany and laid it before Governor Seward but inasmuch as it gave no definite information as to my probable locality it was not at that time deemed advisable to institute measures for my liberation It was concluded to delay trusting that a knowledge of where I was might eventually be obtained A happy and touching scene was witnessed immediately upon our reaching the levee Just as Manning left the brig on his way to the post office two men came up and called aloud for Arthur The latter as he recognized them was almost crazy with delight He could hardly be restrained from leaping over the brig's side and when they met soon after he grasped them by the hand and clung to them a long long time They were men from Norfolk who had come on to New Orleans to rescue him His kidnappers they informed him had been arrested and were then confined in the Norfolk prison They conversed a few moments with the captain and then departed with the rejoicing Arthur But in all the crowd that thronged the wharf there was no one who knew or cared for me Not one No familiar voice greeted my ears nor was there a single face that I had ever seen Soon Arthur would rejoin his family and have the satisfaction of seeing his wrongs avenged my family alas should I ever see them more There was a feeling of utter desolation in my heart filling it with a despairing and regretful sense that I had not gone down with Robert to the bottom of the sea Very soon traders and consignees came on board One a tall thin faced man with light complexion and a little bent made his appearance with a paper in his hand Burch's gang consisting of myself Eliza and her children Harry Lethe and some others who had joined us at Richmond were consigned to him This gentleman was Mr Theophilus Freeman Reading from his paper he called Platt No one answered The name was called again and again but still there was no reply Then Lethe was called then Eliza then Harry until the list was finished each one stepping forward as his or her name was called Captain where's Platt demanded Theophilus Freeman The captain was unable to inform him no one being on board answering to that name Who shipped that nigger he again inquired of the captain pointing to me Burch replied the captain Your name is Platt you answer my description Why don't you come forward he demanded of me in an angry tone I informed him that was not my name that I had never been called by it but that I had no objection to it as I knew of Well I will learn you your name said he and so you won't forget it either by he added Mr Theophilus Freeman by the way was not a whit behind his partner Burch in the matter of blasphemy On the vessel I had gone by the name of Steward and this was the first time I had ever been designated as Platt the name forwarded by Burch to his consignee From the vessel I observed the chain gang at work on the levee We passed near them as we were driven to Freeman's slave pen This pen is very similar to Goodin's in Richmond except the yard was enclosed by plank standing upright with ends sharpened instead of brick walls Including us there were now at least fifty in this pen Depositing our blankets in one of the small buildings in the yard and having been called up and fed we were allowed to saunter about the enclosure until night when we wrapped our blankets round us and laid down under the shed or in the loft or in the open yard just as each one preferred It was but a short time I closed my eyes that night Thought was busy in my brain Could it be possible that I was thousands of miles from home that I had been driven through the streets like a dumb beast that I had been chained and beaten without mercy that I was even then herded with a drove of slaves a slave myself Were the events of the last few weeks realities indeed or was I passing only through the dismal phases of a long protracted dream It was no illusion My cup of sorrow was full to overflowing Then I lifted up my hands to God and in the still watches of the night surrounded by the sleeping forms of my companions begged for mercy on the poor forsaken captive To the Almighty Father of us all the freeman and the slave I poured forth the supplications of a broken spirit imploring strength from on high to bear up against the burden of my troubles until the morning light aroused the slumberers ushering in another day of bondage VI FREEMAN'S INDUSTRY CLEANLINESS AND CLOTHES EXERCISING IN THE SHOW ROOM THE DANCE BOB THE FIDDLER ARRIVAL OF CUSTOMERS SLAVES EXAMINED THE OLD GENTLEMAN OF NEW ORLEANS SALE OF DAVID CAROLINE AND LETHE PARTING OF RANDALL AND ELIZA SMALL POX THE HOSPITAL RECOVERY AND RETURN TO FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN THE PURCHASER OF ELIZA HARRY AND PLATT ELIZA'S AGONY ON PARTING FROM LITTLE EMILY The very amiable pious hearted Mr Theophilus Freeman partner or consignee of James H Burch and keeper of the slave pen in New Orleans was out among his animals early in the morning With an occasional kick of the older men and women and many a sharp crack of the whip about the ears of the younger slaves it was not long before they were all astir and wide awake Mr Theophilus Freeman bustled about in a very industrious manner getting his property ready for the sales room intending no doubt to do that day a rousing business In the first place we were required to wash thoroughly and those with beards to shave We were then furnished with a new suit each cheap but clean The men had hat coat shirt pants and shoes the women frocks of calico and handkerchiefs to bind about their heads We were now conducted into a large room in the front part of the building to which the yard was attached in order to be properly trained before the admission of customers The men were arranged on one side of the room the women on the other The tallest was placed at the head of the row then the next tallest and so on in the order of their respective heights Emily was at the foot of the line of women Freeman charged us to remember our places exhorted us to appear smart and lively sometimes threatening and again holding out various inducements During the day he exercised us in the art of looking smart and of moving to our places with exact precision After being fed in the afternoon we were again paraded and made to dance Bob a colored boy who had some time belonged to Freeman played on the violin Standing near him I made bold to inquire if he could play the Virginia Reel He answered he could not and asked me if I could play Replying in the affirmative he handed me the violin I struck up a tune and finished it Freeman ordered me to continue playing and seemed well pleased telling Bob that I far excelled him a remark that seemed to grieve my musical companion very much Next day many customers called to examine Freeman's new lot The latter gentleman was very loquacious dwelling at much length upon our several good points and qualities He would make us hold up our heads walk briskly back and forth while customers would feel of our hands and arms and bodies turn us about ask us what we could do make us open our mouths and show our teeth precisely as a jockey examines a horse which he is about to barter for or purchase Sometimes a man or woman was taken back to the small house in the yard stripped and inspected more minutely Scars upon a slave's back were considered evidence of a rebellious or unruly spirit and hurt his sale One old gentleman who said he wanted a coachman appeared to take a fancy to me From his conversation with Burch I learned he was a resident in the city I very much desired that he would buy me because I conceived it would not be difficult to make my escape from New Orleans on some northern vessel Freeman asked him fifteen hundred dollars for me The old gentleman insisted it was too much as times were very hard Freeman however declared that I was sound and healthy of a good constitution and intelligent He made it a point to enlarge upon my musical attainments The old gentleman argued quite adroitly that there was nothing extraordinary about the nigger and finally to my regret went out saying he would call again During the day however a number of sales were made David and Caroline were purchased together by a Natchez planter They left us grinning broadly and in the most happy state of mind caused by the fact of their not being separated Lethe was sold to a planter of Baton Rouge her eyes flashing with anger as she was led away The same man also purchased Randall The little fellow was made to jump and run across the floor and perform many other feats exhibiting his activity and condition All the time the trade was going on Eliza was crying aloud and wringing her hands She besought the man not to buy him unless he also bought her self and Emily She promised in that case to be the most faithful slave that ever lived The man answered that he could not afford it and then Eliza burst into a paroxysm of grief weeping plaintively Freeman turned round to her savagely with his whip in his uplifted hand ordering her to stop her noise or he would flog her He would not have such work such snivelling and unless she ceased that minute he would take her to the yard and give her a hundred lashes Yes he would take the nonsense out of her pretty quick if he didn't might he be d d Eliza shrunk before him and tried to wipe away her tears but it was all in vain She wanted to be with her children she said the little time she had to live All the frowns and threats of Freeman could not wholly silence the afflicted mother She kept on begging and beseeching them most piteously not to separate the three Over and over again she told them how she loved her boy A great many times she repeated her former promises how very faithful and obedient she would be how hard she would labor day and night to the last moment of her life if he would only buy them all together But it was of no avail the man could not afford it The bargain was agreed upon and Randall must go alone Then Eliza ran to him embraced him passionately kissed him again and again told him to remember her all the while her tears falling in the boy's face like rain Freeman damned her calling her a blubbering bawling wench and ordered her to go to her place and behave herself and be somebody He swore he wouldn't stand such stuff but a little longer He would soon give her something to cry about if she was not mighty careful and that she might depend upon The planter from Baton Rouge with his new purchases was ready to depart Don't cry mama I will be a good boy Don't cry said Randall looking back as they passed out of the door What has become of the lad God knows It was a mournful scene indeed I would have cried myself if I had dared That night nearly all who came in on the brig Orleans were taken ill They complained of violent pain in the head and back Little Emily a thing unusual with her cried constantly In the morning a physician was called in but was unable to determine the nature of our complaint While examining me and asking questions touching my symptoms I gave it as my opinion that it was an attack of smallpox mentioning the fact of Robert's death as the reason of my belief It might be so indeed he thought and he would send for the head physician of the hospital Shortly the head physician came a small light haired man whom they called Dr Carr He pronounced it small pox whereupon there was much alarm throughout the yard Soon after Dr Carr left Eliza Emmy Harry and myself were put into a hack and driven to the hospital a large white marble building standing on the outskirts of the city Harry and I were placed in a room in one of the upper stories I became very sick For three days I was entirely blind While lying in this state one day Bob came in saying to Dr Carr that Freeman had sent him over to inquire how we were getting on Tell him said the doctor that Platt is very bad but that if he survives until nine o'clock he may recover I expected to die Though there was little in the prospect before me worth living for the near approach of death appalled me I thought I could have been resigned to yield up my life in the bosom of my family but to expire in the midst of strangers under such circumstances was a bitter reflection There were a great number in the hospital of both sexes and of all ages In the rear of the building coffins were manufactured When one died the bell tolled a signal to the undertaker to come and bear away the body to the potter's field Many times each day and night the tolling bell sent forth its melancholy voice announcing another death But my time had not yet come The crisis having passed I began to revive and at the end of two weeks and two days returned with Harry to the pen bearing upon my face the effects of the malady which to this day continues to disfigure it Eliza and Emily were also brought back next day in a hack and again were we paraded in the sales room for the inspection and examination of purchasers I still indulged the hope that the old gentleman in search of a coachman would call again as he had promised and purchase me In that event I felt an abiding confidence that I would soon regain my liberty Customer after customer entered but the old gentleman never made his appearance At length one day while we were in the yard Freeman came out and ordered us to our places in the great room A gentleman was waiting for us as we entered and inasmuch as he will be often mentioned in the progress of this narrative a description of his personal appearance and my estimation of his character at first sight may not be out of place He was a man above the ordinary height somewhat bent and stooping forward He was a good looking man and appeared to have reached about the middle age of life There was nothing repulsive in his presence but on the other hand there was something cheerful and attractive in his face and in his tone of voice The finer elements were all kindly mingled in his breast as any one could see He moved about among us asking many questions as to what we could do and what labor we had been accustomed to if we thought we would like to live with him and would be good boys if he would buy us and other interrogatories of like character After some further inspection and conversation touching prices he finally offered Freeman one thousand dollars for me nine hundred for Harry and seven hundred for Eliza Whether the small pox had depreciated our value or from what cause Freeman had concluded to fall five hundred dollars from the price I was before held at I cannot say At any rate after a little shrewd reflection he announced his acceptance of the offer As soon as Eliza heard it she was in an agony again By this time she had become haggard and hollow eyed with sickness and with sorrow It would be a relief if I could consistently pass over in silence the scene that now ensued It recalls memories more mournful and affecting than any language can portray I have seen mothers kissing for the last time the faces of their dead offspring I have seen them looking down into the grave as the earth fell with a dull sound upon their coffins hiding them from their eyes forever but never have I seen such an exhibition of intense unmeasured and unbounded grief as when Eliza was parted from her child She broke from her place in the line of women and rushing down where Emily was standing caught her in her arms The child sensible of some impending danger instinctively fastened her hands around her mother's neck and nestled her little head upon her bosom Freeman sternly ordered her to be quiet but she did not heed him He caught her by the arm and pulled her rudely but she only clung the closer to the child Then with a volley of great oaths he struck her such a heartless blow that she staggered backward and was like to fall Oh how piteously then did she beseech and beg and pray that they might not be separated Why could they not be purchased together Why not let her have one of her dear children Mercy mercy master she cried falling on her knees Please master buy Emily I can never work any if she is taken from me I will die Freeman interfered again but disregarding him she still plead most earnestly telling how Randall had been taken from her how she never him see him again and now it was too bad oh God it was too bad too cruel to take her away from Emily her pride her only darling that could not live it was so young without its mother Finally after much more of supplication the purchaser of Eliza stepped forward evidently affected and said to Freeman he would buy Emily and asked him what her price was What is her price Buy her was the responsive interrogatory of Theophilus Freeman And instantly answering his own inquiry he added I won't sell her She's not for sale The man remarked he was not in need of one so young that it would be of no profit to him but since the mother was so fond of her rather than see them separated he would pay a reasonable price But to this humane proposal Freeman was entirely deaf He would not sell her then on any account whatever There were heaps and piles of money to be made of her he said when she was a few years older There were men enough in New Orleans who would give five thousand dollars for such an extra handsome fancy piece as Emily would be rather than not get her No no he would not sell her then She was a beauty a picture a doll one of the regular bloods none of your thick lipped bullet headed cotton picking niggers if she was might he be d d When Eliza heard Freeman's determination not to part with Emily she became absolutely frantic I will not go without her They shall not take her from me she fairly shrieked her shrieks commingling with the loud and angry voice of Freeman commanding her to be silent Meantime Harry and myself had been to the yard and returned with our blankets and were at the front door ready to leave Our purchaser stood near us gazing at Eliza with an expression indicative of regret at having bought her at the expense of so much sorrow We waited some time when finally Freeman out of patience tore Emily from her mother by main force the two clinging to each other with all their might Don't leave me mama don't leave me screamed the child as its mother was pushed harshly forward Don't leave me come back mama she still cried stretching forth her little arms imploringly But she cried in vain Out of the door and into the street we were quickly hurried Still we could hear her calling to her mother Come back don't leave me come back mama until her infant voice grew faint and still more faint and gradually died away as distance intervened and finally was wholly lost Eliza never after saw or heard of Emily or Randall Day nor night however were they ever absent from her memory In the cotton field in the cabin always and everywhere she was talking of them often to them as if they were actually present Only when absorbed in that illusion or asleep did she ever have a moment's comfort afterwards She was no common slave as has been said To a large share of natural intelligence which she possessed was added a general knowledge and information on most subjects She had enjoyed opportunities such as are afforded to very few of her oppressed class She had been lifted up into the regions of a higher life Freedom freedom for herself and for her offspring for many years had been her cloud by day her pillar of fire by night In her pilgrimage through the wilderness of bondage with eyes fixed upon that hope inspiring beacon she had at length ascended to the top of Pisgah and beheld the land of promise In an unexpected moment she was utterly overwhelmed with disappointment and despair The glorious vision of liberty faded from her sight as they led her away into captivity Now she weepeth sore in the night and tears are on her cheeks all her friends have dealt treacherously with her they have become her enemies VII THE STEAMBOAT RODOLPH DEPARTURE FROM NEW ORLEANS WILLIAM FORD ARRIVAL AT ALEXANDRIA ON RED RIVER RESOLUTIONS THE GREAT PINE WOODS WILD CATTLE MARTIN'S SUMMER RESIDENCE THE TEXAS ROAD ARRIVAL AT MASTER FORD'S ROSE MISTRESS FORD SALLY AND HER CHILDREN JOHN THE COOK WALTER SAM AND ANTONY THE MILLS ON INDIAN CREEK SABBATH DAYS SAM'S CONVERSION THE PROFIT OF KINDNESS RAFTING ADAM TAYDEM THE LITTLE WHITE MAN CASCALLA AND HIS TRIBE THE INDIAN BALL JOHN TIBEATS THE STORM APPROACHING ON leaving the New Orleans slave pen Harry and I followed our new master through the streets while Eliza crying and turning back was forced along by Freeman and his minions until we found ourselves on board the steamboat Rodolph then lying at the levee In the course of half an hour we were moving briskly up the Mississippi bound for some point on Red River There were quite a number of slaves on board beside ourselves just purchased in the New Orleans market I remember a Mr Kelsow who was said to be a well known and extensive planter had in charge a gang of women Our master's name was William Ford He resided then in the Great Pine Woods in the parish of Avoyelles situated on the right bank of Red River in the heart of Louisiana He is now a Baptist preacher Throughout the whole parish of Avoyelles and especially along both shores of Bayou Boeuf where he is more intimately known he is accounted by his fellow citizens as a worthy minister of God In many northern minds perhaps the idea of a man holding his brother man in servitude and the traffic in human flesh may seem altogether incompatible with their conceptions of a moral or religious life From descriptions of such men as Burch and Freeman and others hereinafter mentioned they are led to despise and execrate the whole class of slaveholders indiscriminately But I was sometime his slave and had an opportunity of learning well his character and disposition and it is but simple justice to him when I say in my opinion there never was a more kind noble candid Christian man than William Ford The influences and associations that had always surrounded him blinded him to the inherent wrong at the bottom of the system of Slavery He never doubted the moral right of one man holding another in subjection Looking through the same medium with his fathers before him he saw things in the same light Brought up under other circumstances and other influences his notions would undoubtedly have been different Nevertheless he was a model master walking uprightly according to the light of his understanding and fortunate was the slave who came to his possession Were all men such as he Slavery would be deprived of more than half its bitterness We were two days and three nights on board the steamboat Rodolph during which time nothing of particular interest occurred I was now known as Platt the name given me by Burch and by which I was designated through the whole period of my servitude Eliza was sold by the name of Dradey She was so distinguished in the conveyance to Ford now on record in the recorder's office in New Orleans On our passage I was constantly reflecting on my situation and consulting with myself on the best course to pursue in order to effect my ultimate escape Sometimes not only then but afterwards I was almost on the point of disclosing fully to Ford the facts of my history I am inclined now to the opinion it would have resulted in my benefit This course was often considered but through fear of its miscarriage never put into execution until eventually my transfer and his pecuniary embarrassments rendered it evidently unsafe Afterwards under other masters unlike William Ford I knew well enough the slightest knowledge of my real character would consign me at once to the remoter depths of Slavery I was too costly a chattel to be lost and was well aware that I would be taken farther on into some by place over the Texan border perhaps and sold that I would be disposed of as the thief disposes of his stolen horse if my right to freedom was even whispered So I resolved to lock the secret closely in my heart never to utter one word or syllable as to who or what I was trusting in Providence and my own shrewdness for deliverance At length we left the steamboat Rodolph at a place called Alexandria several hundred miles from New Orleans It is a small town on the southern shore of Red River Having remained there over night we entered the morning train of cars and were soon at Bayou Lamourie a still smaller place distant eighteen miles from Alexandria At that time it was the termination of the railroad Ford's plantation was situated on the Texas road twelve miles from Lamourie in the Great Pine Woods This distance it was announced to us must be traveled on foot there being public conveyances no farther Accordingly we all set out in the company of Ford It was an excessively hot day Harry Eliza and myself were yet weak and the bottoms of our feet w were very tender from the effects of the small pox We proceeded slowly Ford telling us to take our time and sit down and rest whenever we desired a privilege that was taken advantage of quite frequently After leaving Lamourie and crossing two plantations one belonging to Mr Carnell the other to a Mr Flint we reached the Pine Woods a wilderness that stretches to the Sabine River The whole country about Red River is low and marshy The Pine Woods as they are called is comparatively upland with frequent small intervals however running through them This upland is covered with numerous trees the white oak the chincopin resembling chestnut but principally the yellow pine They are of great size running up sixty feet and perfectly straight The woods were full of cattle very shy and wild dashing away in herds with a loud snuff at our approach Some of them were marked or branded the rest appeared to be in their wild and untamed state They are much smaller than northern breeds and the peculiarity about them that most attracted my attention was their horns They stand out from the sides of the head precisely straight like two iron spikes At noon we reached a cleared piece of ground containing three or four acres Upon it was a small unpainted wooden house a corn crib or as we would say a barn and a log kitchen standing about a rod from the house It was the summer residence of Mr Martin Rich planters having large establishments on Bayou Boeuf are accustomed to spend the warmer season in these woods Here they find clear water and delightful shades In fact these retreats are to the planters of that section of the country what Newport and Saratoga are to the wealthier inhabitants of northern cities We were sent around into the kitchen and supplied with sweet potatoes corn bread and bacon while Master Ford dined with Martin in the house There were several slaves about the premises Martin came out and took a look at us asking Ford the price of each if we were green hands and so forth and making inquiries in relation to the slave market generally After a long rest we set forth again following the Texas road which had the appearance of being very rarely traveled For five miles we passed through continuous woods without observing a single habitation At length just as the sun was sinking in the west we entered another opening containing some twelve or fifteen acres In this opening stood a house much larger than Mr Martin's It was two stories high with a piazza in front In the rear of it was also a log kitchen poultry house corncribs and several negro cabins Near the house was a peach orchard and gardens of orange and pomegranate trees The space was entirely surrounded by woods and covered with a carpet of rich rank verdure It was a quiet lonely pleasant place literally a green spot in the wilderness It was the residence of my master William Ford As we approached a yellow girl her name was Rose was standing on the piazza Going to the door she called her mistress who presently came running out to meet her lord She kissed him and laughingly demanded if he had bought those niggers Ford said he had and told us to go round to Sally's cabin and rest ourselves Turning the corner of the house we discovered Sally washing her two baby children near her rolling on the grass They jumped up and toddled towards us looked at us a moment like a brace of rabbits then ran back to their mother as if afraid of us Sally conducted us into the cabin told us to lay down our bundles and be seated for she was sure that we were tired Just then John the cook a boy some sixteen years of age and blacker than any crow came running in looked steadily in our faces then turning round without saying as much as how d'ye do ran back to the kitchen laughing loudly as if our coming was a great joke indeed Much wearied with our walk as soon as it was dark Harry and I wrapped our blankets round us and laid down upon the cabin floor My thoughts as usual wandered back to my wife and children The consciousness of my real situation the hopelessness of any effort to escape through the wide forests of Avoyelles pressed heavily upon me yet my heart was at home in Saratoga I was awakened early in the morning by the voice of Master Ford calling Rose She hastened into the house to dress the children Sally to the field to milk the cows while John was busy in the kitchen preparing breakfast In the meantime Harry and I were strolling about the yard looking at our new quarters Just after breakfast a colored man driving three yoke of oxen attached to a wagon load of lumber drove into the opening He was a slave of Ford's named Walton the husband of Rose By the way Rose was a native of Washington and had been brought from thence five years before She had never seen Eliza but she had heard of Berry and they knew the same streets and the same people either personally or by reputation They became fast friends immediately and talked a great deal together of old times and of friends they had left behind Ford was at that time a wealthy man Besides his seat in the Pine Woods he owned a large lumbering establishment on Indian Creek four miles distant and also in his wife's right an extensive plantation and many slaves on Bayou Boeuf Walton had come with his load of lumber from the mills on Indian Creek Ford directed us to return with him saying he would follow us as soon as possible Before leaving Mistress Ford called me into the storeroom and handed me as it is there termed a tin bucket of molasses for Harry and myself Eliza was still ringing her hands and deploring the loss of her children Ford tried as much as possible to console her told her she need not work very hard that she might remain with Rose and assist the madam in the house affairs Riding with Walton in the wagon Harry and I became quite well acquainted with him long before reaching Indian Creek He was a born thrall of Ford's and spoke kindly and affectionately of him as a child would speak of his own father In answer to his inquiries from whence I came I told him from Washington Of that city he had heard much from his wife Rose and all the way plied me with many extravagant and absurd questions On reaching the mills at Indian Creek we found two more of Ford's slaves Sam and Antony Sam also was a Washingtonian having been brought out in the same gang with Rose He had worked on a farm near Georgetown Antony was a blacksmith from Kentucky who had been in his present master's service about ten years Sam knew Burch and when informed that he was the trader who had sent me on from Washington it was remarkable how well we agreed upon the subject of his superlative rascality He had forwarded Sam also On Ford's arrival at the mill we were employed in piling lumber and chopping logs which occupation we continued during the remainder of the summer We usually spent our Sabbaths at the opening on which days our master would gather all his slaves about him and read and expound the Scriptures He sought to inculcate in our minds feelings of kindness towards each other of dependence upon God setting forth the rewards promised unto those who lead an upright and prayerful life Seated in the doorway of his house surrounded by his man servants and his maid servants who looded earnestly into the good man's face he spoke of the loving kindness of the Creator and of the life that is to come Often did the voice of prayer ascend from his lips to heaven the only sound that broke the solitude of the place In the course of the summer Sam became deeply convicted his mind dwelling intensely on the subject of religion His mistress gave him a Bible which he carried with him to his work Whatever leisure time was allowed him he spent in perusing it though it was only with great difficulty that he could master any part of it I often read to him a favor which he well repaid me by many expressions of gratitude Sam's piety was frequently observed by white men who came to the mill and the remark it most generally provoked was that a man like Ford who allowed his slaves to have Bibles was not fit to own a nigger He however lost nothing by his kindness It is a fact I have more than once observed that those who treated their slaves most leniently were rewarded by the greatest amount of labor I know it from my own experience It was a source of pleasure to surprise Master Ford with a greater day's work than was required while under subsequent masters there was no prompter to extra effort but the overseer's lash It was the desire of Ford's approving voice that suggested to me an idea that resulted to his profit The lumber we were manufacturing was contracted to be delivered at Lamourie It had hitherto been transported by land and was an important item of expense Indian Creek upon which the mills were situated was a narrow but deep stream emptying into Bayou Boeuf In some places it was not more than twelve feet wide and much obstructed with trunks of trees Bayou Boeuf was connected with Bayou Lamourie I ascertained the distance from the mills to the point on the latter bayou where our lumber was to be delivered was but a few miles less by land than by water Provided the creek could be made navigable for rafts it occurred to me that the expense of transportation would be materially diminished Adam Taydem a little white man who had been a soldier in Florida and had strolled into that distant region was foreman and superintendent of the mills He scouted the idea but Ford when I laid it before him received it favorably and permitted me to try the experiment Having removed the obstructions I made up a narrow raft consisting of twelve cribs At this business I think I was quite skillful not having forgotten my experience years before on the Champlain canal I labored hard being extremely anxious to succeed both from a desire to please my master and to show Adam Taydem that my scheme was not such a visionary one as he incessantly pronounced it One hand could manage three cribs I took charge of the forward three and commenced poling down the creek In due time we entered the first bayou and finally reached our destination in a shorter period of time than I had anticipated The arrival of the raft at Lamourie created a sensation while Mr Ford loaded me with commendation On all sides I heard Ford's Platt pronounced the smartest nigger in the Pine Woods in fact I was the Fulton of Indian Creek I was not insensible to the praise bestowed upon me and enjoyed especially my triumph over Taydem whose half malicious ridicule had stung my pride From this time the entire control of bringing the lumber to Lamourie was placed in my hands until the contract was fulfilled Indian Creek in its whole length flows through a magnificent forest There dwells on its shore a tribe of Indians a remnant of the Chickasaws or Chickopees if I remember rightly They live in simple huts ten or twelve feet square constructed of pine poles and covered with bark They subsist principally on the flesh of the deer the coon and opossum all of which are plenty in these woods Sometimes they exchange venison for a little corn and whisky with the planters on the bayous Their usual dress is buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic colors buttoned from belt to chin They wear brass rings on their wrists and in their ears and noses The dress of the squaws is very similar They are fond of dogs and horses owning many of the latter of a small tough breed and are skillful riders Their bridles girths and saddles were made of raw skins of animals their stirrups of a certain kind of wood Mounted astride their ponies men and women I have seen them dash out into the woods at the utmost of their speed following narrow winding paths and dodging trees in a manner that eclipsed the most miraculous feats of civilized equestrianism Circling away in various directions the forest echoing and re echoing with their whoops they would presently return at the same dashing headlong speed with which they started Their village was on Indian Creek known as Indian Castle but their range extended to the Sabine River Occasionally a tribe from Texas would come over on a visit and then there was indeed a carnival in the Great Pine Woods Chief of the tribe was Cascalla second in rank John Baltese his son in law with both of whom as with many others of the tribe I became acquainted during my frequent voyages down the creek with rafts Sam and myself would often visit them when the day's task w as done They were obedient to the chief the word of Cascalla was their law They were a rude but harmless people and enjoyed their wild mode of life They had little fancy for the open country the cleared lands on the shores of the bayous but preferred to hide themselves within the shadows of the forest They worshiped the Great Spirit loved whisky and were happy On one occasion I was present at a dance when a roving herd from Texas had encamped in their village The entire carcass of a deer was roasting before a large fire which threw its light a long distance among the trees under which they were assembled When they had formed in a ring men and squaws alternately a sort of Indian fiddle set up an indescribable tune It was a continuous melancholy kind of wavy sound with the slightest possible variation At the first note if indeed there was more than one note in the whole tune they circled around trotting after each other and giving utterance to a guttural sing song noise equally as nondescript as the music of the fiddle At the end of the third circuit they would stop suddenly whoop as if their lungs would crack then break from the ring forming in couples man and squaw each jumping backwards as far as possible from the other then forwards which graceful feat having been twice or thrice accomplished they would form in a ring and go trotting round again The best dancer appeared to be considered the one who could whoop the loudest jump the farthest and utter the most excruciating noise At intervals one or more would leave the dancing circle and going to the fire cut from the roasting carcass a slice of venison In a hole shaped like a mortar cut in the trunk of a fallen tree they pounded corn with a wooden pestle and of the meal made cake Alternately they danced and ate Thus were the visitors from Texas entertained by the dusky sons and daughters of the Chicopees and such is a description as I saw it of an Indian ball in the Pine Woods of Avoyelles In the autumn I left the mills and was employed at the opening One day the mistress was urging Ford to procure a loom in order that Sally might commence weaving cloth for the winter garments of the slaves He could not imagine where one was to be found when I suggested that the easiest way to get one would be to make it informing him at the same time that I was a sort of Jack at all trades and would attempt it with his permission It was granted very readily and I was allowed to go to a neighboring planter's to inspect one before commencing the undertaking At length it was finished and pronounced by Sally to be perfect She could easily weave her task of fourteen yards milk the cows and have leisure time besides each day It worked so well I was continued in the employment of making looms which were taken down to the plantation on the bayou At this time one John M Tibeats a capenter came to the opening to do some work on master's house I was directed to quit the looms and assist him For two weeks I was in his company planing and matching boards for ceiling a plastered room being a rare thing in the parish of Avoyelles John M Tibeats was the opposite of Ford in all respects He was a small crabbed quick tempered spiteful man He had no fixed residence that I ever heard of but passed from one plantation to another wherever he could find employment He was without standing in the community not esteemed by white men nor even respected by slaves He was ignorant withal and of a revengeful disposition He left the parish long before I did and I know not whether he is at present alive or dead Certain it is it was a most unlucky day for me that brought us together During my residence with Master Ford I had seen only the bright side of slavery His was no heavy hand crushing us to the earth He pointed upwards and with benign and cheering words addressed us as his fellow mortals accountable like himself to the Maker of us all I think of him with affection and had my family been with me could have borne his gentle servitude without murmuring all my days But clouds were gathering in the horizon forerunners of a pitiless storm that was soon to break over me I was doomed to endure such bitter trials as the poor slave only knows and to lead no more the comparatively happy life which I had led in the Great Pine Woods VIII FORD'S EMBARRASSMENTS THE SALE TO TIBEATS THE CHATTEL MORTGAGE

LAWSON AND THE BROWN MULE MESSAGE TO THE PINE WOODS William Ford unfortunately became embarrassed in his pecuniary affairs A heavy judgement was rendered against him in consequence of his having become security for his brother Franklin Ford residing on Red River above Alexandria and who had failed to meet his liabilities He was also indebted to John M Tibeats to a considerable amount in consideration of his services in building the mills on Indian Creek and also a weaving house corn mill and other erections on the plantation at Bayou Boeuf not yet completed It was therefore necessary in order to meet these demands to dispose of eighteen slaves myself among the number Seventeen of them including Sam and Harry were purchased by Peter Compton a planter also residing on Red River I was sold to Tibeats in consequence undoubtedly of my slight skill as a carpenter This was in the winter of The deed of myself from Freeman to Ford as I ascertained from the public records in New Orleans on my return was dated June d At the time of my sale to Tibeats the price agreed to be given for me being more than the debt Ford took a chattel mortgage of four hundred dollars I am indebted for my life as will hereafter be seen to that mortgage I bade farewell to my good friends at the opening and departed with my new master Tibeats We went down to the plantation on Bayou Boeuf distant twenty seven miles from the Pine Woods to complete the unfinished contract Bayou Boeuf is a sluggish winding stream one of those stagnant bodies of water common in that region setting back from Red River It stretches from a point not far from Alexandra in a south easterly direction and following its tortuous course is more than fifty miles in length Large cotton and sugar plantations line each shore extending back to the borders of interminable swamps It is alive with aligators rendering it unsafe for swine or unthinking slave children to stroll along its banks Upon a bend in this bayou a short distance from Cheneyville was situated the plantation of Madam Ford her brother Peter Tanner a great landholder living on the opposite side On my arrival at Bayou Boeuf I had the pleasure of meeting Eliza whom I had not seen for several months She had not pleased Mrs Ford being more occupied in brooding over her sorrows than in attending to her business and had in consequence been sent down to work in the field on the plantation She had grown feeble and emaciated and was still mourning for her children She asked me if I had forgotten them and a great many times inquired if I still remembered how handsome little Emily was how much Randall loved her and wondered if they were living still and where the darlings could then be She had sunk beneath the weight of an excessive grief Her drooping form and hollow cheeks too plainly indicated that she had well nigh reached the end of her weary road Ford's overseer on this plantation and who had the exclusive charge of it was a Mr Chapin a kindly disposed man and a native of Pennsylvania In common with others he held Tibeats in light estimation which fact in connection with the four hundred dollar mortgage was fortunate for me I was now compelled to labor very hard From earliest dawn until late at night I was not allowed to be a moment idle Notwithstanding which Tibeats was never satisfied He was continually cursing and complaining He never spoke to me a kind word I was his faithful slave and earned him large wages every day and yet I went to my cabin nightly loaded with abuse and stinging epithets We had completed the corn mill the kitchen an so forth and were at work upon the weaving house when I was guilty of an act in that State punishable with death It was my first fight with Tibeats The weaving house we were erecting stood in the orchard a few rods from the residence of Chapin or the great house as it was called One night having worked until it was too dark to see I was ordered by Tibeats to rise very early in the morning procure a keg of nails from Chapin and commence putting on the clapboards I retired to the cabin extremely tired and having cooked a supper of bacon and corn cake and conversed a while with Eliza who occupied the same cabin as also did Lawson and his wife Mary and a slave named Bristol laid down upon the ground floor little dreaming of the sufferings that awaited me on the morrow Before daylight I was on the piazza of the great house awaiting the appearance of overseer Chapin To have aroused him from his slumbers and stated my errand would have been an unpardonable boldness At length he came out Taking off my hat I informed him Master Tibeats had directed me to call upon him for a keg of nails Going into the store room he rolled it out at the same time saying if Tibeats preferred a different size he would endeavor to furnish them but that I might use those until further directed Then mounting his horse which stood saddled and bridled at the door he rode away into the field whither the slaves had preceded him while I took the keg on my shoulder and proceeding to the weaving house broke in the head and commenced nailing on the clapboards As the day began to open Tibeats came out of the house to where I was hard at work He seemed to be that morning even more morose and disagreeable than usual He was my master entitled by law to my flesh and blood and to exercise over me such tyrannical control as his mean nature prompted but there was no law that could prevent my looking upon him with intense contempt I despised both his disposition and his intellect I had just come round to the keg for a further supply of nails as he reached the weaving house I thought I told you to commence putting on weather boards this morning he remarked Yes master and I am about it I replied Where he demanded On the other side was my answer He walked round to the other side examined my work for a while muttering to himself in a fault finding tone Didn't I tell you last night to get a keg of nails of Chapin he broke forth again Yes master and so I did and overseer said he would get another size for you if you wanted them when he came back from the field Tibeats walked to the keg looked a moment at the contents then kicked it violently Coming towards me in a great passion he exclaimed G d d n you I thought you knowed something I made answer I tried to do as you told me master I didn't mean anything wrong Overseer said But he interrupted me with such a flood of curses that I was unable to finish the sentence At length he ran towards the house and going to the piazza took down one of the overseer's whips The whip had a short wooden stock braided over with leather and was loaded at the butt The lash was three feet long or thereabouts and made of raw hide strands At first I was somewhat frightened and my impulse was to run There was no one about except Rachel the cook and Chapin's wife and neither of them were to be seen The rest were in the field I knew he intended to whip me and it was the first time any one had attempted it since my arrival at Avoyelles I felt moreover that I had been faithful that I was guilty of no wrong whatever and deserved commendation rather than punishment My fear changed to anger and before he reached me I had made up my mind fully not to be whipped let the result be life or death Winding the lash around his hand and taking hold of the small end of the stock he walked up to me and with a malignant look ordered me to strip Master Tibeats said I looking him boldly in the face I will not I was about to say something further in justification but with concentrated vengeance he sprang upon me seizing me by the throat with one hand raising the whip with the other in the act of striking Before the blow descended however I had caught him by the collar of the coat and drawn him closely to me Reaching down I seized him by the ankle and pushing him back with the other hand he fell over on the ground Putting one arm around his leg and holding it to my breast so that his head and shoulders only touched the ground I placed my foot upon his neck He was completely in my power My blood was up It seemed to course through my veins like fire In the frenzy of my madness I snatched the whip from his hand He struggled with all his power swore that I should not live to see another day and that he would tear out my heart But his struggles and his threats were alike in vain I cannot tell how many times I struck him Blow after blow fell fast and heavy upon his wriggling form At length he screamed cried murder and at last the blasphemous tyrant called on God for mercy But he who had never shown mercy did not receive it The stiff stock of the whip warped round his cringing body until my right arm ached Until this time I had been too busy to look about me Desisting for a moment I saw Mrs Chapin looking from the window and Rachel standing in the kitchen door Their attitudes expressed the utmost excitement and alarm His screams had been heard in the field Chapin was coming as fast as he could ride I struck him a blow or two more then pushed him from me with such a well directed kick that he went rolling over on the ground Rising to his feet and brushing the dirt from his hair he stood looking at me pale with rage We gazed at each other in silence Not a word was uttered until Chapin galloped up to us What is the matter he cried out Master Tibeats wants to whip me for using the nails you gave me I replied What is the matter with the nails he inquired turning to Tibeats Tibeats answered to the effect that they were too large paying little heed however to Chapin's question but still keeping his snakish eyes fastened maliciously on me I am overseer here Chapin began I told Platt to take them and use them and if they were not of the proper size I would get others on returning from the field It is not his fault Besides I shall furnish such nails as I please I hope you will understand that Mr Tibeats Tibeats made no reply but grinding his teeth and shaking his fist swore he would have satisfaction and that it was not half over yet Thereupon he walked away followed by the overseer and entered the house the latter talking to him all the while in a suppressed tone and with earnest gestures I remained where I was doubting whether it was better to fly or abide the result whatever it might be Presently Tibeats came out of the house and saddling his horse the only property he possessed besides myself departed on the road to Chenyville When he was gone Chapin came out visibly excited telling me not to stir not to attempt to leave the plantation on any account whatever He then went to the kitchen and calling Rachel out conversed with her some time Coming back he again charged me with great earnestness not to run saying my master was a rascal that he had left on no good errand and that there might be trouble before night But at all events he insisted upon it I must not stir As I stood there feelings of unutterable agony overwhelmed me I was conscious that I had subjected myself to unimaginable punishment The reaction that followed my extreme ebullition of anger produced the most painful sensations of regret An unfriended helpless slave what could I do what could I say to justify in the remotest manner the heinous act I had committed of resenting a white man's contumely and abuse I tried to pray I tried to beseech my Heavenly Father to sustain me in my sore extremity but emotion choked my utterance and I could only bow my head upon my hands and weep For at least an hour I remained in this situation finding relief only in tears when looking up I beheld Tibeats accompanied by two horsemen coming down the bayou They rode into the yard jumped from their horses and approached me with large whips one of them also carrying a coil of rope Cross your hands commanded Tibeats with the addition of such a shuddering expression of blasphemy as is not decorous to repeat You need not bind me Master Tibeats I am ready to go with you anywhere said I One of his companions then stepped forward swearing if I made the least resistance he would break my head he would tear me limb from limb he would cut my black throat and giving wide scope to other similar expressions Perceiving any importunity altogether vain I crossed my hands submitting humbly to whatever disposition they might please to make of me Thereupon Tibeats tied my wrists drawing the rope around them with his utmost strength Then he bound my ankles in the same manner In the meantime the other two had slipped a cord within my elbows running it across my back and tying it firmly It was utterly impossible to move hand or foot With a remaining piece of rope Tibeats made an awkward noose and placed it about my neck Now then inquired one of Tibeats' companions where shall we hang the nigger One proposed such a limb extending from the body of a peach tree near the spot where we were standing His comrade objected to it alleging it would break and proposed another Finally they fixed upon the latter During this conversation and all the time they were binding me I uttered not a word Overseer Chapin during the progress of the scene was walking hastily back and forth on the piazza Rachel was crying by the kitchen door and Mrs Chapin was still looking from the window Hope died within my heart Surely my time had come I should never behold the light of another day never behold the faces of my children the sweet anticipation I had cherished with such fondness I should that hour struggle through the fearful agonies of death None would mourn for me none revenge me Soon my form would be mouldering in that distant soil or perhaps be cast to the slimy reptiles that filled the stagnant waters of the bayou Tears flowed down my cheeks but they only afforded a subject of insulting comment for my executioners At length as they were dragging me towards the tree Chapin who had momentarily disappeared from the piazza came out of the house and walked towards us He had a pistol in each hand and as near as I can now recall to mind spoke in a firm determined manner as follows Gentlemen I have a few words to say You had better listen to them Whoever moves that slave another foot from where he stands is a dead man In the first place he does not deserve this treatment It is a shame to murder him in this manner I never knew a more faithful boy than Platt You Tibeats are in the fault yourself You are pretty much of a scoundrel and I know it and you richly deserve the flogging you have received In the next place I have been overseer on this plantation seven years and in the absence of William Ford am master here My duty is to protect his interests and that duty I shall perform You are not responsible you are a worthless fellow Ford holds a mortgage on Platt of four hundred dollars If you hang him he loses his debt Until that is canceled you have no right to take his life You have no right to take it any way There is a law for the slave as well as for the white man You are no better than a murderer As for you addressing Cook and Ramsay a couple of overseers from neighboring plantations as for you begone If you have any regard for your own safety I say begone Cook and Ramsay without a further word mounted their horses and rode away Tibeats in a few minutes evidently in fear and overawed by the decided tone of Chapin sneaked off like a coward as he was and mounting his horse followed his companions I remained standing where I was still bound with the rope around my neck As soon as they were gone Chapin called Rachel ordering her to run to the field and tell Lawson to hurry to the house without delay and bring the brown mule with him an animal much prized for its unusual fleetness Presently the boy appeared Lawson said Chapin you must go to the Pine Woods Tell your master Ford to come here at once that he must not delay a single moment Tell him they are trying to murder Platt Now hurry boy Be at the Pine Woods by noon if you kill the mule Chapin stepped into the house and wrote a pass When he returned Lawson was at the door mounted on his mule Receiving the pass he plied the whip right smartly to the beast dashed out of the yard and turning up the bayou on a hard gallop in less time than it has taken me to describe the scene was out of sight IX THE HOT SUN YET BOUND THE CORDS SINK INTO MY FLESH CHAPIN'S UNEASINESS SPECULATION RACHEL AND HER CUP OF WATER SUFFERING INCREASES THE HAPPINESS OF SLAVERY ARRIVAL OF FORD HE CUTS THE CORDS WHICH BIND ME AND TAKES THE ROPE FROM MY NECK MISERY THE GATHERING OF THE SLAVES IN ELIZA'S CABIN THEIR KINDNESS RACHEL REPEATS THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY LAWSON ENTERTAINS HIS COMPANIONS WITH AN ACCOUNT OF HIS RIDE CHAPIN'S APPREHENSIONS OF TIBEATS HIRED TO PETER TANNER PETER EXPOUNDS THE SCRIPTURES DESCRIPTION OF THE STOCKS As the sun approached the meridian that day it became insufferably warm Its hot rays scorched the ground The earth almost blistered the foot that stood upon it I was without coat or hat standing bareheaded exposed to its burning blaze Great drops of perspiration rolled down my face drenching the scanty apparel wherewith I was clothed Over the fence a very little way off the peach trees cast their cool delicious shadows on the grass I would gladly have given a long year of service to have been enabled to exchange the heated oven as it were wherein I stood for a seat beneath their branches But I was yet bound the rope still dangling from my neck and standing in the same tracks where Tibeats and his comrades left me I could not move an inch so firmly had I been bound To have been enabled to lean against the weaving house would have been a luxury indeed But it was far beyond my reach though distant less than twenty feet I wanted to lie down but knew I could not rise again The ground was so parched and boiling hot I was aware it would but add to the discomfort of my situation If I could have only moved my position however slightly it would have been relief unspeakable But the hot rays of a southern sun beating all the long summer day on my bare head produced not half the suffering I experienced from my aching limbs My wrists and ankles and the cords of my legs and arms began to swell burying the rope that bound them into the swollen flesh All day Chapin walked back and forth upon the stoop but not once approached me He appeared to be in a state of great uneasiness looking first towards me and then up the road as if expecting some arrival every moment He did not go to the field as was his custom It was evident from his manner that he supposed Tibeats would return with more and better armed assistance perhaps to renew the quarrel and it was equally evident he had prepared his mind to defend my life at whatever hazard Why he did not relieve me why he suffered me to remain in agony the whole weary day I never knew It was not for want of sympathy I am certain Perhaps he wished Ford to see the rope about my neck and the brutal manner in which I had been bound perhaps his interference with another's property in which he had no legal interest might have been a trespass which would have subjected him to the penalty of the law Why Tibeats was all day absent was another mystery I never could divine He knew well enough that Chapin would not harm him unless he persisted in his design against me Lawson told me afterwards that as he passed the plantation of John David Cheney he saw the three and that they turned and looked after him as he flew by I think his supposition was that Lawson had been sent out by Overseer Chapin to arouse the neighboring planters and to call on them to come to his assistance He therefore undoubtedly acted on the principle that discretion is the better part of valor and kept away But whatever motive may have governed the cowardly and malignant tyrant it is of no importance There I still stood in the noon tide sun groaning with pain From long before daylight I had not eaten a morsel I was growing faint from pain and thirst and hunger Once only in the very hottest portion of the day Rachel half fearful she was acting contrary to the overseer's wishes ventured to me and held a cup of water to my lips The humble creature never knew nor could she comprehend if she had heard them the blessings I invoked upon her for that balmy draught She could only say Oh Platt how I do pity you and then hastened back to her labors in the kitchen Never did the sun move so slowly through the heavens never did it shower down such fervent and fiery rays as it did that day At least so it appeared to me What my meditations were the innumerable thoughts that thronged through my distracted brain I will not attempt to give expression to Suffice it to say during the whole long day I came not to the conclusion even once that the southern slave fed clothed whipped and protected by his master is happier than the free colored citizen of the North To that conclusion I have never since arrived There are many however even in the Northern States benevolent and well disposed men who will pronounce my opinion erroneous and gravely proceed to substantiate the assertion with an argument Alas they have never drank as I have from the bitter cup of slavery Just at sunset my heart leaped with unbounded joy as Ford came riding into the yard his horse covered with foam Chapin met him at the door and after conversing a short time he walked directly to me Poor Platt you are in a bad state was the only expression that escaped his lips Thank God said I thank God Master Ford that you have come at last Drawing a knife from his pocket he indignantly cut the cord from my wrists arms and ankles and slipped the noose from my neck I attempted to walk but staggered like a drunken man and fell partially to the ground Ford returned immediately to the house leaving me alone again As he reached the piazza Tibeats and his two friends rode up A long dialogue followed I could hear the sound of their voices the mild tones of Ford mingling with the angry accents of Tibeats but was unable to distinguish what was said Finally the three departed again apparently not well pleased I endeavored to raise the hammer thinking to show Ford how willing I was to work by proceeding with my labors on the weaving house but it fell from my nerveless hand At dark I crawled into the cabin and laid down I was in great misery all sore and swollen the slightest movement producing excruciating suffering Soon the hands came in from the field Rachel when she went after Lawson had told them what had happened Eliza and Mary broiled me a piece of bacon but my appetite was gone Then they scorched some corn meal and made coffee It was all that I could take Eliza consoled me and was very kind It was not long before the cabin was full of slaves They gathered round me asking many questions about the difficulty with Tibeats in the morning and the particulars of all the occurrences of the day Then Rachel came in and in her simple language repeated it over again dwelling emphatically on the kick that sent Tibeats rolling over on the ground whereupon there was a general titter throughout the crowd Then she described how Chapin walked out with his pistols and rescued me and how Master Ford cut the ropes with his knife just as if he was mad By this time Lawson had returned He had to regale them with an account of his trip to the Pine Woods how the brown mule bore him faster than a streak o' lightnin how he astonished everybody as he flew along how Master Ford started right away how he said Platt was a good nigger and they shouldn't kill him concluding with pretty strong intimations that there was not another human being in the wide world who could have created such a universal sensation on the road or performed such a marvelous John Gilpin feat as he had done that day on the brown mule The kind creatures loaded me with the expression of their sympathy saying Tibeats was a hard cruel man and hoping Massa Ford would get me back again In this manner they passed the time discussing chatting talking over end over again the exciting affair until suddenly Chapin presented himself at the cabin door and called me Platt said he you will sleep on the floor in the great house to night bring your blanket with you I arose as quickly as I was able took my blanket in my hand and followed him On the way he informed me that he should not wonder if Tibeats was back again before morning that he intended to kill me and that he did not mean he should do it without witnesses Had he stabbed me to the heart in the presence of a hundred slaves not one of them by the laws of Louisiana could have given evidence against him I laid down on the floor in the great house the first and the last time such a sumptuous resting place was granted me during my twelve years of bondage and tried to sleep Near midnight the dog began to bark Chapin arose looked from the window but could discover nothing At length the dog was quiet As he returned to his room he said I believe Platt that scoundrel is skulking about the premises somewhere If the dog barks again and I am sleeping wake me I promised to do so After the lapse of an hour or more the dog re commenced his clamor running towards the gate then back again all the while barking furiously Chapin was out of bed without waiting to be called On this occasion he stepped forth upon the piazza and remained standing there a considerable length of time Nothing however was to be seen and the dog returned to his kennel We were not disturbed again during the night The excessive pain that I suffered and the dread of some impending danger prevented any rest whatever Whether or not Tibeats did actually return to the plantation that night seeking an opportunity to wreak his vengeance upon me is a secret known only to himself perhaps I thought then however and have the strong impression still that he was there At all events he had the disposition of an assassin cowering before a brave man's words but ready to strike his helpless or unsuspecting victim in the back as I had reason afterwards to know At daylight in the morning I arose sore and weary having rested little Nevertheless after partaking breakfast which Mary and Eliza had prepared for me in the cabin I proceeded to the weaving house and commenced the labors of another day It was Chapin's practice as it is the practice of overseers generally immediately on arising to bestride his horse always saddled and bridled and ready for him the particular business of some slave and ride into the field This morning on the contrary he came to the weaving house asking if I had seen anything of Tibeats yet Replying in the negative he remarked there was something not right about the fellow there was bad blood in him that I must keep a sharp watch of him or he would do me wrong some day when I least expected it While he was yet speaking Tibeats rode in hitched his horse and entered the house I had little fear of him while Ford and Chapin were at hand but they could not be near me always Oh how heavily the weight of slavery pressed upon me then I must toil day after day endure abuse and taunts and scoffs sleep on the hard ground live on the coarsest fare and not only this but live the slave of a blood seeking wretch of whom I must stand henceforth in continued fear and dread Why had I not died in my young years before God had given me children to love and live for What unhappiness and suffering and sorrow it would have prevented I sighed for liberty but the bondman's chain was round me and could not be shaken off I could only gaze wistfully towards the North and think of the thousands of miles that stretched between me and the soil of freedom over which a black freeman may not pass Tibeats in the course of half an hour walked over to the weaving house looked at me sharply then returned without saying anything Most of the forenoon he sat on the piazza reading a newspaper and conversing with Ford After dinner the latter left for the Pine Woods and it was indeed with regret that I beheld him depart from the plantation Once more during the day Tibeats came to me gave me some order and returned During the week the weaving house was completed Tibeats in the meantime making no allusion whatever to the difficulty when I was informed he had hired me to Peter Tanner to work under another carpenter by the name of Myers This announcement was received with gratification as any place was desirable that would relieve me of his hateful presence Peter Tanner as the reader has already been informed lived on the opposite shore and was the brother of Mistress Ford He is one of the most extensive planters on Bayou Boeuf and owns a large number of slaves Over I went to Tanner's joyfully enough He had heard of my late difficulties in fact I ascertained the flogging of Tibeats was soon blazoned far and wide This affair together with my rafting experiment had rendered me somewhat notorious More than once I heard it said that Platt Ford now Platt Tibeats a slave's name changes with his change of master was a devil of a nigger But I was destined to make a still further noise as will presently be seen throughout the little world of Bayou Boeuf Peter Tanner endeavored to impress upon me the idea that he was quite severe though I could perceive there was a vein of good humor in the old fellow after all You're the nigger he said to me on my arrival You're the nigger that flogged your master eh You're the nigger that kicks and holds carpenter Tibeats by the leg and wallops him are ye I'd like to see you hold me by the leg I should You're a 'portant character you're a great nigger very remarkable nigger ain't ye I'd lash you I'd take the tantrums out of ye Jest take hold of my leg if you please None of your pranks here my boy remember that Now go to work you kickin' rascal concluded Peter Tanner unable to suppress a half comical grin at his own wit and sarcasm After listening to this salutation I was taken charge of by Myers and labored under his direction for a month to his and my own satisfaction Like William Ford his brother in law Tanner was in the habit of reading the Bible to his slaves on the Sabbath but in a somewhat different spirit He was an impressive commentator on the New Testament The first Sunday after my coming to the plantation he called them together and began to read the twelfth of Luke When he came to the th verse he looked deliberately around him and continued And that servant which knew his lord's will here he paused looking around more deliberately than before and again proceeded which knew his lord's will and prepared not himself here was another pause prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes D'ye hear that demanded Peter emphatically Stripes he repeated slowly and distinctly taking off his spectacles preparatory to making a few remarks That nigger that don't take care that don't obey his lord that's his master d'ye see that 'ere nigger shall be beaten with many stripes Now 'many' signifies a great many forty a hundred a hundred and fifty lashes That's Scripter and so Peter continued to elucidate the subject for a great length of time much to the edification of his sable audience At the conclusion of the exercises calling up three of his slaves Warner Will and Major or he cried out to me Here Platt you held Tibeats by the legs now I'll see if you can hold these rascals in the same way till I get back from meetin' Thereupon he ordered them to the stocks a common thing on plantations in the Red River country The stocks are formed of two planks the lower one made fast at the ends to two short posts driven firmly into the ground At regular distances half circles are cut in the upper edge The other plank is fastened to one of the posts by a hinge so that it can be opened or shut down in the same manner as the blade of a pocket knife is shut or opened In the lower edge of the upper plank corresponding half circles are also cut so that when they close a row of holes is formed large enough to admit a negro's leg above the ankle but not large enough to enable him to draw out his foot The other end of the upper plank opposite the hinge is fastened to its post by lock and key The slave is made to sit upon the ground when the uppermost prank is elevated his legs just above the ankles placed in the sub half circles and shutting it down again and locking it he is held secure and fast Very often the neck instead of the ankle is enclosed In this manner they are held during the operation of whipping Warner Will and Major according to Tanner's account of them were melon stealing Sabbath breaking niggers and not approving of such wickedness he felt it his duty to put them in the stocks Handing me the key himself Myers Mistress Tanner and the children entered the carriage and drove away to church at Cheneyville When they were gone the boys begged me to let them out I felt sorry to see them sitting on the hot ground and remembered my own sufferings in the sun Upon their promise to return to the stocks at any moment they were required to do so I consented to release them Grateful for the lenity shown them and in order in some measure to repay it they could do no less of course than pilot me to the melon patch Shortly before Tanner's return they were in the stocks again Finally he drove up and looking at the boys said with a chuckle Aha ye havn't been strolling about much to day any way I'll teach you what's what I'll tire ye of eating water melons on the Lord's day ye Sabbath breaking niggers Peter Tanner prided himself upon his strict religious observances he was a deacon in the church But I have now reached a point in the progress of my narrative when it becomes necessary to turn away from these light descriptions to the more grave and weighty matter of the second battle with Master Tibeats and the flight through the great Pacoudrie Swamp X RETURN TO TIBEATS IMPOSSIBILITY OF PLEASING HIM HE ATTACKS ME WITH A HATCHET THE STRUGGLE OVER THE BROAD AXE THE TEMPTATION TO MURDER HIM ESCAPE ACROSS THE PLANTATION OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FENCE TIBEATS APPROACHES FOLLOWED BY THE HOUNDS THEY TAKE MY TRACK THEIR LOUD YELLS THEY ALMOST OVERTAKE ME I REACH THE WATER THE POUNDS CONFUSED MOCCASIN SNAKE ALLIGATORS NIGHT IN THE GREAT PACOUDRIE SWAMP THE SOUNDS OF LIFE NORTH WEST COURSE EMERGE INTO THE PINE WOODS THE SLAVE AND HIS YOUNG MASTER ARRIVAL AT FORD'S FOOD AND REST AT the end of a month my services being no longer required at Tanner's I was sent over the bayou again to my master whom I found engaged in building the cotton press This was situated at some distance from the great house in a rather retired place I commenced working once more in company with Tibeats being entirely alone with him most part of the time I remembered the words of Chapin his precautions his advice to beware lest in some unsuspecting moment he might injure me They were always in my mind so that I lived in a most uneasy state of apprehension and fear One eye was on my work the other on my master I determined to give him no cause of offence to work still more diligently if possible than I had done to bear whatever abuse he might heap upon me save bodily injury humbly and patiently hoping thereby to soften in some degree his manner towards me until the blessed time might come when I should be delivered from his clutches The third morning after my return Chapin left the plantation for Cheneyville to be absent until night Tibeats on that morning was attacked with one of those periodical fits of spleen and ill humor to which he was frequently subject rendering him still more disagreeable and venomous than usual It was about nine o'clock in the forenoon when I was busily employed with the jack plane on one of the sweeps Tibeats was standing by the work bench fitting a handle into the chisel with which he had been engaged previously in cutting the thread of the screw You are not planing that down enough said he It is just even with the line I replied You're a d d liar he exclaimed passionately Oh well master I said mildly I will plane it down more if you say so at the same time proceeding to do as I supposed he desired Before one shaving had been removed however he cried out saying I had now planed it too deep it was too small I had spoiled the sweep entirely Then followed curses and imprecations I had endeavored to do exactly as he directed but nothing would satisfy the unreasonable man In silence and in dread I stood by the sweep holding the jack plane in my hand not knowing what to do and not daring to be idle His anger grew more and more violent until finally with an oath such a bitter frightful oath as only Tibeats could utter he seized a hatchet from the work bench and darted towards me swearing he would cut my head open It was a moment of life or death The sharp bright blade of the hatchet glittered in the sun In another instant it would be buried in my brain and yet in that instant so quick will a man's thoughts come to him in such a fearful strait I reasoned with myself If I stood still my doom was certain if I fled ten chances to one the hatchet flying from his hand with a too deadly and unerring aim would strike me in the back There was but one course to take Springing towards him with all my power and meeting him full half way before he could bring down the blow with one hand I caught his uplifted arm with the other seized him by the throat We stood looking each other in the eyes In his I could see murder I felt as if I had a serpent by the neck watching the slightest relaxation of my gripe to coil itself round my body crushing and stinging it to death I thought to scream aloud trusting that some ear might catch the sound but Chapin was away the hands were in the field there was no living soul in sight or hearing The good genius which thus far through life has saved me from the hands of violence at that moment suggested a lucky thought With a vigorous and sudden kick that brought him on one knee with a groan I released my hold upon his throat snatched the hatchet and cast it beyond reach Frantic with rage maddened beyond control he seized a white oak stick five feet long perhaps and as large in circumference as his hand could grasp which was lying on the ground Again he rushed towards me and again I met him seized him about the waist and being the stronger of the two bore him to the earth While in that position I obtained possession of the stick and rising cast it from me also He likewise arose and ran for the broad axe on the work bench Fortunately there was a heavy plank lying upon its broad blade in such a manner that he could not extricate it before I had sprung upon his back Pressing him down closely and heavily on the plank so that the axe was held more firmly to its place I endeavored but in vain to break his grasp upon the handle In that position we remained some minutes There have been hours in my unhappy life many of them when the contemplation of death as the end of earthly sorrow of the grave as a resting place for the tired and worn out body has been pleasant to dwell upon But such contemplations vanish in the hour of peril No man in his full strength can stand undismayed in the presence of the king of terrors Life is dear to every living thing the worm that crawls upon the ground will struggle for it At that moment it was dear to me enslaved and treated as I was Not able to unloose his hand once more I seized him by the throat and this time with a vice like gripe that soon relaxed his hold He became pliant and unstrung His face that had been white with passion was now black from suffocation Those small serpent eyes that spat such venom were now full of horror two great white orbs starting from their sockets There was a lurking devil in my heart that prompted me to kill the human blood hound on the spot to retain the gripe on his accursed throat till the breath of life was gone I dared not murder him and I dared not let him live If I killed him my life must pay the forfeit if he lived my life only would satisfy his vengeance A voice within whispered me to fly To be a wanderer among the swamps a fugitive and a vagabond on the face of the earth was preferable to the life that I was leading My resolution was soon formed and swinging him from the work bench to the ground I leaped a fence near by and hurried across the plantation passing the slaves at work in the cotton field At the end of a quarter of a mile I reached the wood pasture and it was a short time indeed that I had been running it Climbing on to a high fence I could see the cotton press the great house and the space between It was a conspicuous position from whence the whole plantation was in view I saw Tibeats cross the field towards the house and enter it then he came out carrying his saddle and presently mounted his horse and galloped away I was desolate but thankful Thankful that my life was spared desolate and discouraged with the prospect before me What would become of me Who would befriend me Whither should I fly Oh God Thou who gavest me life and implanted in my bosom the love of life who filled it with emotions such as other men thy creatures have do not forsake me Have pity on the poor slave let me not perish If thou cost not protect me I am lost lost Such supplications silently and unuttered ascended from my inmost heart to Heaven But there was no answering voice no sweet low tone coming down from on high whispering to my soul It is I be not afraid I was the forsaken of God it seemed the despised and hated of men In about three fourths of an hour several of the slaves shouted and made signs for me to run Presently looking up the bayou I saw Tibeats and two others on horse back coming at a fast gait followed by a troop of dogs There were as many as eight or ten Distant as I was I knew them They belonged on the adjoining plantation The dogs used on Bayou Boeuf for hunting slaves are a kind of blood hound but a far more savage breed than is found in the Northern States They will attack a negro at their master's bidding and cling to him as the common bull dog will cling to a four footed animal Frequently their loud bay is heard in the swamps and then there is speculation as to what point the runaway will be overhauled the same as a New York hunter stops to listen to the hounds coursing along the hillsides and suggests to his companion that the fox will be taken at such a place I never knew a slave escaping with his life from Bayou Bouef One reason is they are not allowed to learn the art of swimming and are incapable of crossing the most inconsiderable stream In their flight they can go in no direction but a little way without coming to a bayou when the inevitable alternative is presented of being drowned or overtaken by the dogs In youth I had practiced in the clear streams that flow through my native district until I had become an expert swimmer and felt at home in the watery element I stood upon the fence until the dogs had reached the cotton press In an instant more their long savage yells announced they were on my track Leaping down from my position I ran towards the swamp Fear gave me strength and I exerted it to the utmost Every few moments I could hear the yelpings of the dogs They were gaining upon me Every howl was nearer and nearer Each moment I expected they would spring upon my back expected to feel their long teeth sinking into my flesh There were so many of them I knew they would tear me to pieces that they would worry me at once to death I gasped for breath gasped forth a half uttered choking prayer to the Almighty to save me to give me strength to reach some wide deep bayou where I could throw them off the track or sink into its waters Presently I reached a thick palmetto bottom As I fled through them they made a loud rustling noise not loud enough however to drown the voices of the dogs Continuing my course due south as nearly as I can judge I came at length to water just over shoe The hounds at that moment could not have been five rods behind me I could hear them crashing and plunging through the palmettoes their loud eager yells making the whole swamp clamorous with the sound Hope revived a little as I reached the water If it were only deeper they might loose the scent and thus disconcerted afford me the opportunity of evading them Luckily it grew deeper the farther I proceeded now over my ankles now half way to my knees now sinking a moment to my waist and then emerging presently into more shallow places The dogs had not gained upon me since I struck the water Evidently they were confused Now their savage intonations grew more and more distant assuring me that I was leaving them Finally I stopped to listen but the long howl came booming on the air again telling me I was not yet safe From bog to bog where I had stepped they could still keep upon the track though impeded by the water At length to my great joy I came to a wide bayou and plunging in had soon stemmed its sluggish current to the other side There certainly the dogs would be confounded the current carrying down the stream all traces of that slight mysterious scent which enables the quick smelling hound to follow in the track of the fugitive After crossing this bayou the water became so deep I could not run I was now in what I afterwards learned was the Great Pacoudrie Swamp It was filled with immense trees the sycamore the gum the cotton wood and cypress and extends I am informed to the shore of the Calcasieu river For thirty or forty miles it is without inhabitants save wild beasts the bear the wild cat the tiger and great slimy reptiles that are crawling through it everywhere Long before I reached the bayou in fact from the time I struck the water until I emerged from the swamp on my return these reptiles surrounded me I saw hundreds of moccasin snakes Every log and bog every trunk of a fallen tree over which I was compelled to step or climb was alive with them They crawled away at my approach but sometimes in my haste I almost placed my hand or foot upon them They are poisonous serpents their bite more fatal than the rattlesnake's Besides I had lost one shoe the sole having come entirely off leaving the upper only dangling to my ankle I saw also many alligators great and small lying in the water or on pieces of floodwood The noise I made usually startled them when they moved off and plunged into the deepest places Sometimes however I would come directly upon a monster before observing it In such cases I would start back run a short way round and in that manner shun them Straight forward they will run a short distance rapidly but do not possess the power of turning In a crooked race there is no difficulty in evading them About two o'clock in the afternoon I heard the last of the hounds Probably they did not cross the bayou Wet and weary but relieved from the sense of instant peril I continued on more cautious and afraid however of the snakes and alligators than I had been in the earlier portion of my flight Now before stepping into a muddy pool I would strike the water with a stick If the waters moved I would go around it if not would venture through At length the sun went down and gradually night's trailing mantle shrouded the great swamp in darkness Still I staggered on fearing every instant I should feel the dreadful sting of the moccasin or be crushed within the jaws of some disturbed alligator The dread of them now almost equaled the fear of the pursuing hounds The moon arose after a time its mild light creeping through the overspreading branches loaded with long pendent moss I kept traveling forwards until after midnight hoping all the while that I would soon emerge into some less desolate and dangerous region But the water grew deeper and the walking more difficult than ever I perceived it would be impossible to proceed much farther and knew not moreover what hands I might fall into should I succeed in reaching a human habitation Not provided with a pass any white man would be at liberty to arrest me and place me in prison until such time as my master should prove property pay charges and take me away I was an estray and if so unfortunate as to meet a law abiding citizen of Louisiana he would deem it his duty to his neighbor perhaps to put me forthwith in the pound Really it was difficult to determine which I had most reason to fear dogs alligators or men After midnight however I came to a halt Imagination cannot picture the dreariness of the scene The swamp was resonant with the quacking of innumerable ducks Since the foundation of the earth in all probability a human footstep had never before so far penetrated the recesses of the swamp It was not silent now silent to a degree that rendered it oppressive as it was when the sun was shining in the heavens My midnight intrusion had awakened the feathered tribes which seemed to throng the morass in hundreds of thousands and their garrulous throats poured forth such multitudinous sounds there was such a fluttering of wings such sullen plunges in the water all around me that I was affrighted and appalled All the fowls of the air and all the creeping things of the earth appeared to have assembled together in that particular place for the purpose of filling it with clamor and confusion Not by human dwellings not in crowded cities alone are the sights and sounds of life The wildest places of the earth are full of them Even in the heart of that dismal swamp God had provided a refuge and a dwelling place for millions of living things The moon had now risen above the trees when I resolved upon a new project Thus far I had endeavored to travel as nearly south as possible Turning about I proceeded in a north west direction my object being to strike the Pine Woods in the vicinity of Master Ford's Once within the shadow of his protection I felt I would be comparatively safe My clothes were in tatters my hands face and body covered with scratches received from the sharp knots of fallen trees and in climbing over piles of brush and floodwood My bare foot was full of thorns I was besmeared with muck and mud and the green slime that had collected on the surface of the dead water in which I had been immersed to the neck many times during the day and night Hour after hour and tiresome indeed had they become I continued to plod along on my north west course The water began to grow less deep and the ground more firm under my feet At last I reached the Pacoudrie the same wide bayou I had swam while outward bound I swam it again and shortly after thought I heard a cock crow but the sound was faint and it might have been a mockery of the ear The water receded from my advancing footsteps now I had left the bogs behind me now now I was on dry land that gradually ascended to the plain and I knew I was somewhere in the Great Pine Woods Just at day break I came to an opening a sort of small plantation but one I had never seen before In the edge of the woods I came upon two men a slave and his young master engaged in catching wild hogs The white man I knew would demand my pass and not able to give him one would take me into possession I was too wearied to run again and too desperate to be taken and therefore adopted a ruse that proved entirely successful Assuming a fierce expression I walked directly towards him looking him steadily in the face As I approached he moved backwards with an air of alarm It was plain he was much affrighted that he looked upon me as some infernal goblin just arisen from the bowels of the swamp Where does William Ford live I demanded in no gentle tone He lives seven miles from here was the reply Which is the way to his place I again demanded trying to look more fiercely than ever Do you see those pine trees yonder he asked pointing to two a mile distant that rose far above their fellows like a couple of tall sentinels overlooking the broad expanse of forest I see them was the answer At the feet of those pine trees he continued runs the Texas road Turn to the left and it will lead you to William Ford's Without further parley I hastened forward happy as he was no doubt to place the widest possible distance between us Striking the Texas road I turned to the left hand as directed and soon passed a great fire where a pile of logs were burning I went to it thinking I would dry my clothes but the gray light of the morning was fast breaking away some passing white man might observe me besides the heat overpowered me with the desire of sleep so lingering no longer I continued my travels and finally about eight o'clock reached the house of Master Ford The slaves were all absent from the quarters at their work Stepping on to the piazza I knocked at the door which was soon opened by Mistress Ford My appearance was so changed I was in such a wobegone and forlorn condition she did not know me Inquiring if Master Ford was at home that good man made his appearance before the question could be answered I told him of my flight and all the particulars connected with it He listened attentively and when I had concluded spoke to me kindly and sympathetically and taking me to the kitchen called John and ordered him to prepare me food I had tasted nothing since daylight the previous morning When John had set the meal before me the madam came out with a bowl of milk and many little delicious dainties such as rarely please the palate of a slave I was hungry and I was weary but neither food nor rest afforded half the pleasure as did the blessed voices speaking kindness and consolation It was the oil and the wine which the Good Samaritan in the Great Pine Woods was ready to pour into the wounded spirit of the slave who came to him stripped of his raiment and half dead They left me in the cabin that I might rest Blessed be sleep It visiteth all alike descending as the dews of heaven on the bond and free Soon it nestled to my bosom driving away the troubles that oppressed it and bearing me to that shadowy region where I saw again the faces and listened to the voices of my children who alas for aught I knew in my waking hours had fallen into the arms of that other sleep from which they never would arouse XI THE MISTRESS' GARDEN THE CRIMSON AND GOLDEN FRUIT ORANGE

sleep sometime in the afternoon I awoke refreshed but very sore and stiff Sally came in and talked with me while John cooked me some dinner Sally was in great trouble as well as myself one of her children being ill and she feared it could not survive Dinner over after walking about the quarters for a while visiting Sally's cabin and looking at the sick child I strolled into the madam's garden Though it was a season of the year when the voices of the birds are silent and the trees are stripped of their summer glories in more frigid climes yet the whole variety of roses were then blooming there and the long luxuriant vines creeping over the frames The crimson and golden fruit hung half hidden amidst the younger and older blossoms of the peach the orange the plum and the pomegranate for in that region of almost perpetual warmth the leaves are falling and the buds bursting into bloom the whole year long I indulged the most grateful feelings towards Master and Mistress Ford and wishing in some manner to repay their kindness commenced trimming the vines and afterwards weeding out the grass from among the orange and pomegranate trees The latter grows eight or ten feet high and its fruit though larger is similar in appearance to the jelly flower It has the luscious flavor of the strawberry Oranges peaches plums and most other fruits are indigenous to the rich warm soil of Avoyelles but the apple the most common of them all in colder latitudes is rarely to be seen Mistress Ford came out presently saying it was praise worthy in me but I was not in a condition to labor and might rest myself at the quarters until master should go down to Bayou Boeuf which would not be that day and it might not be the next I said to her to be sure I felt bad and was stiff and that my foot pained me the stubs and thorns having so torn it but thought such exercise would not hurt me and that it was a great pleasure to work for so good a mistress Thereupon she returned to the great house and for three days I was diligent in the garden cleaning the walks weeding the flower beds and pulling up the rank grass beneath the jessamine vines which the gentle and generous hand of my protectress had taught to clamber along the walls The fourth morning having become recruited and refreshed Master Ford ordered me to make ready to accompany him to the bayou There was but one saddle horse at the opening all the others with the mules having been sent down to the plantation I said I could walk and bidding Sally and John good bye left the opening trotting along by the horse's side That little paradise in the Great Pine Woods was the oasis in the desert towards which my heart turned lovingly during many years of bondage I went forth from it now with regret and sorrow not so overwhelming however as if it had then been given me to know that I should never return to it again Master Ford urged me to take his place occasionally on the horse to rest me but I said no I was not tired and it was better for me to walk than him He said many kind and cheering things to me on the way riding slowly in order that I might keep pace with him The goodness of God was manifest he declared in my miraculous escape from the swamp As Daniel came forth unharmed from the den of lions and as Jonah had been preserved in the whale's belly even so had I been delivered from evil by the Almighty He interrogated me in regard to the various fears and emotions I had experienced during the day and night and if I had felt at any time a desire to pray I felt forsaken of the whole world I answered him and was praying mentally all the while At such times said he the heart of man turns instinctively towards his Maker In prosperity and when there is nothing to injure or make him afraid he remembers Him not and is ready to defy Him but place him in the midst of dangers cut him off from human aid let the grave open before him then it is in the time of his tribulation that the scoffer and unbelieving man turns to God for help feeling there is no other hope or refuge or safety save in his protecting arm So did that benignant man speak to me of this life and of the life hereafter of the goodness and power of God and of the vanity of earthly things as we journeyed along the solitary road towards Bayou Boeuf When within some five miles of the plantation we discovered a horseman at a distance galloping towards us As he came near I saw that it was Tibeats He looked at me a moment but did not address me and turning about rode along side by side with Ford I trotted silently at their horses' heels listing to their conversation Ford informed him of my arrival in the Pine Woods three days before of the sad plight I was in and of the difficulties and dangers I had encountered Well exclaimed Tibeats omitting his usual oaths in the presence of Ford I never saw such running before I'll bet him against a hundred dollars he'll beat any nigger in Louisiana I offered John David Cheney twenty five dollars to catch him dead or alive but he outran his dogs in a fair race Them Cheney dogs ain't much after all Dunwoodie's hounds would have had him down before he touched the palmettoes Somehow the dogs got off the track and we had to give up the hunt We rode the horses as far as we could and then kept on foot till the water was three feet deep The boys said he was drowned sure I allow I wanted a shot at him mightily Ever since I have been riding up and down the bayou but had'nt much hope of catching him thought he was dead sartin Oh he's a cuss to run that nigger is In this way Tibeats ran on describing his search in the swamp the wonderful speed with which I had fled before the hounds and when he had finished Master Ford responded by saying I had always been a willing and faithful boy with him that he was sorry we had such trouble that according to Platt's story he had been inhumanly treated and that he Tibeats was himself in fault Using hatchets and broad axes upon slaves was shameful and should not be allowed he remarked This is no way of dealing with them when first brought into the country It will have a pernicious influence and set them all running away The swamps will be full of them A little kindness would be far more effectual in restraining them and rendering them obedient than the use of such deadly weapons Every planter on the bayou should frown upon such inhumanity It is for the interest of all to do so It is evident enough Mr Tibeats that you and Platt cannot live together You dislike him and would not hesitate to kill him and knowing it he will run from you again through fear of his life Now Tibeats you must sell him or hire him out at least Unless you do so I shall take measures to get him out of your possession In this spirit Ford addressed him the remainder of the distance I opened not my mouth On reaching the plantation they entered the great house while I repaired to Eliza's cabin The slaves were astonished to find me there on returning from the field supposing I was drowned That night again they gathered about the cabin to listen to the story of my adventure They took it for granted I would be whipped and that it would be severe the well known penalty of running away being five hundred lashes Poor fellow said Eliza taking me by the hand it would have been better for you if you had drowned You have a cruel master and he will kill you yet I am afraid Lawson suggested that it might be overseer Chapin would be appointed to inflict the punishment in which case it would not be severe whereupon Mary Rachel Bristol and others hoped it would be Master Ford and then it would be no whipping at all They all pitied me and tried to console me and were sad in view of the castigation that awaited me except Kentucky John There were no bounds to his laughter he filled the cabin with cachinnations holding his sides to prevent an explosion and the cause of his noisy mirth was the idea of my outstripping the hounds Somehow he looked at the subject in a comical light I know'd dey would'nt cotch him when he run cross de plantation O de lor' did'nt Platt pick his feet right up tho' hey When dem dogs got whar he was he was'nt dar haw haw haw O de lor' a' mity and then Kentucky John relapsed into another of his boisterous fits Early the next morning Tibeats left the plantation In the course of the forenoon while sauntering about the gin house a tall good looking man came to me and inquired if I was Tibeats' boy that youthful appellation being applied indiscriminately to slaves even though they may have passed the number of three score years and ten I took off my hat and answered that I was How would you like to work for me he inquired Oh I would like to very much said I inspired with a sudden hope of getting away from Tibeats You worked under Myers at Peter Tanner's didn't you I replied I had adding some complimentary remarks that Myers had made concerning me Well boy said he I have hired you of your master to work for me in the Big Cane Brake thirty eight miles from here down on Red River This man was Mr Eldret who lived below Ford's on the same side of the bayou I accompanied him to his plantation and in the morning started with his slave Sam and a wagon load of provisions drawn by four mules for the Big Cane Eldret and Myers having preceded us on horseback This Sam was a native of Charleston where he had a mother brother and sisters He allowed a common word among both black and white that Tibeats was a mean man and hoped as I most earnestly did also that his master would buy me We proceeded down the south shore of the bayou crossing it at Carey's plantation from thence to Huff Power passing which we came upon the Bayou Rouge road which runs towards Red River After passing through Bayou Rouge Swamp and just at sunset turning from the highway we struck off into the Big Cane Brake We followed an unbeaten track scarcely wide enough to admit the wagon The cane such as are used for fishing rods were as thick as they could stand A person could not be seen through them the distance of a rod The paths of wild beasts run through them in various directions the bear and the American tiger abounding in these brakes and wherever there is a basin of stagnant water it is full of alligators We kept on our lonely course through the Big Cane several miles when we entered a clearing known as Sutton's Field Many years before a man by the name of Sutton had penetrated the wilderness of cane to this solitary place Tradition has it that he fled thither a fugitive not from service but from justice Here he lived alone recluse and hermit of the swamp with his own hands planting the seed and gathering in the harvest One day a band of Indians stole upon his solitude and after a bloody battle overpowered and massacred him For miles the country round in the slaves' quarters and on the piazzas of great houses where white children listen to superstitious tales the story goes that that spot in the heart of the Big Cane is a haunted place For more than a quarter of a century human voices had rarely if ever disturbed the silence of the clearing Rank and noxious weeds had overspread the once cultivated field serpents sunned themselves on the doorway of the crumbling cabin It was indeed a dreary picture of desolation Passing Sutton's Field we followed a new cut road two miles farther which brought us to its termination We had now reached the wild lands of Mr Eldret where he contemplated clearing up an extensive plantation We went to work next morning with our cane knives and cleared a sufficient space to allow the erection of two cabins one for Myers and Eldret the other for Sam myself and the slaves that were to join us We were now in the midst of trees of enormous growth whose wide spreading branches almost shut out the light of the sun while the space between the trunks was an impervious mass of cane with here and there an occasional palmetto The bay and the sycamore the oak and the cypress reach a growth unparalleled in those fertile lowlands bordering the Red River From every tree moreover hang long large masses of moss presenting to the eye unaccustomed to them a striking and singular appearance This moss in large quantities is sent north and there used for manufacturing purposes We cut down oaks split them into rails and with these erected temporary cabins We covered the roofs with the broad palmetto leaf an excellent substitute for shingles as long as they last The greatest annoyance I met with here were small flies gnats and mosquitoes They swarmed the air They penetrated the porches of the ear the nose the eyes the mouth They sucked themselves beneath the skin It was impossible to brush or beat them off It seemed indeed as if they would devour us carry us away piecemeal in their small tormenting mouths A lonelier spot or one more disagreeable than the centre of the Big Cane Brake it would be difficult to conceive yet to me it was a paradise in comparison with any other place in the company of Master Tibeats I labored hard and oft times was weary and fatigued yet I could lie down at night in peace and arise in the morning without fear In the course of a fortnight four black girls came down from Eldret's plantation Charlotte Fanny Cresia and Nelly They were all large and stout Axes were put into their hands and they were sent out with Sam and myself to cut trees They were excellent choppers the largest oak or sycamore standing but a brief season before their heavy and well directed blows At piling logs they were equal to any man There are lumberwomen as well as lumbermen in the forests of the South In fact in the region of the Bayou Boeuf they perform their share of all the labor required on the plantation They plough drag drive team clear wild lands work on the highway and so forth Some planters owning large cotton and sugar plantations have none other than the labor of slave women Such an one is Jim Burns who lives on the north shore of the bayou opposite the plantation of John Fogaman On our arrival in the brake Eldret promised me if I worked well I might go up to visit my friends at Ford's in four weeks On Saturday night of the fifth week I reminded him of his promise when he told me I had done so well that I might go I had set my heart upon it and Eldret's announcement thrilled me with pleasure I was to return in time to commence the labors of the day on Tuesday morning While indulging the pleasant anticipation of so soon meeting my old friends again suddenly the hateful form of Tibeats appeared among us He inquired how Myers and Platt got along together and was told very well and that Platt was going up to Ford's plantation in the morning on a visit Poh poh sneered Tibeats it isn't worth while the nigger will get unsteady He can't go But Eldret insisted I had worked faithfully that he had given me his promise and that under the circumstances I ought not to be disappointed They then it being about dark entered one cabin and I the other I could not give up the idea of going it was a sore disappointment Before morning I resolved if Eldret made no objection to leave at all hazards At daylight I was at his door with my blanket rolled up into a bundle and hanging on a stick over my shoulder waiting for a pass Tibeats came out presently in one of his disagreeable moods washed his face and going to a stump near by sat down upon it apparently busily thinking with himself After standing there a long time impelled by a sudden impulse of impatience I started off Are you going without a pass he cried out to me Yes master I thought I would I answered How do you think you'll get there demanded he Don't know was all the reply I made him You'd be taken and sent to jail where you ought to be before you got half way there he added passing into the cabin as he said it He came out soon with the pass in his hand and calling me a d d nigger that deserved a hundred lashes threw it on the ground I picked it up and hurried away right speedily A slave caught off his master's plantation without a pass may be seized and whipped by any white man whom he meets The one I now received was dated and read as follows Platt has permission to go to Ford's plantation on Bayou Boeuf and return by Tuesday morning JOHN M TIBEATS This is the usual form On the way a great many demanded it read it and passed on Those having the air and appearance of gentlemen whose dress indicated the possession of wealth frequently took no notice of me whatever but a shabby fellow an unmistakable loafer never failed to hail me and to scrutinize and examine me in the most thorough manner Catching runaways is sometimes a money making business If after advertising no owner appears they may be sold to the highest bidder and certain fees are allowed the finder for his services at all events even if reclaimed A mean white therefore a name applied to the species loafer considers it a god send to meet an unknown negro without a pass There are no inns along the highways in that portion of the State where I sojourned I was wholly destitute of money neither did I carry any provisions on my journey from the Big Cane to Bayou Boeuf nevertheless with his pass in his hand a slave need never suffer from hunger or from thirst It is only necessary to present it to the master or overseer of a plantation and state his wants when he will be sent round to the kitchen and provided with food or shelter as the case may require The traveler stops at any house and calls for a meal with as much freedom as if it was a public tavern It is the general custom of the country Whatever their faults may be it is certain the inhabitants along Red River and around the bayous in the interior of Louisiana are not wanting in hospitality I arrived at Ford's plantation towards the close of the afternoon passing the evening in Eliza's cabin with Lawson Rachel and others of my acquaintance When we left Washington Eliza's form was round and plump She stood erect and in her silks and jewels presented a picture of graceful strength and elegance Now she was but a thin shadow of her former self Her face had become ghastly haggard and the once straight and active form was bowed down as if bearing the weight of a hundred years Crouching on her cabin floor and clad in the coarse garments of a slave old Elisha Berry would not have recognized the mother of his child I never saw her afterwards Having become useless in the cotton field she was bartered for a trifle to some man residing in the vicinity of Peter Compton's Grief had gnawed remorselessly at her heart until her strength was gone and for that her last master it is said lashed and abused her most unmercifully But he could not whip back the departed vigor of her youth nor straighten up that bended body to its full height such as it was when her children were around her and the light of freedom was shining on her path I learned the particulars relative to her departure from this world from some of Compton's slaves who had come over Red River to the bayou to assist young Madam Tanner during the busy season She became at length they said utterly helpless for several weeks lying on the ground floor in a dilapidated cabin dependent upon the mercy of her fellowthralls for an occasional drop of water and a morsel of food Her master did not knock her on the head as is sometimes done to put a suffering animal out of misery but left her unprovided for and unprotected to linger through a life of pain and wretchedness to its natural close When the hands returned from the field one night they found her dead During the day the Angel of the Lord who moveth invisibly over all the earth gathering in his harvest of departing souls had silently entered the cabin of the dying woman and taken her from thence She was free at last Next day rolling up my blanket I started on my return to the Big Cane After traveling five miles at a place called Huff Power the ever present Tibeats met me in the road He inquired why I was going back so soon and when informed I was anxious to return by the time I was directed he said I need go no farther than the next plantation as he had that day sold me to Edwin Epps We walked down into the yard where we met the latter gentleman who examined me and asked me the usual questions propounded by purchasers Having been duly delivered over I was ordered to the quarters and at the same time directed to make a hoe and axe handle for myself I was now no longer the property of Tibeats his dog his brute dreading his wrath and cruelty day and night and whoever or whatever my new master might prove to be I could not certainly regret the change So it was good news when the sale was announced and with a sigh of relief I sat down for the first time in my new abode Tibeats soon after disappeared from that section of the country Once afterwards and only once I caught a glimpse of him It was many miles from Bayou Boeuf He was seated in the doorway of a low groggery I was passing in a drove of slaves through St Mary's parish XII PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF EPPS

possession Edwin Epps was fond of the bottle his sprees sometimes extending over the space of two whole weeks Latterly however he had reformed his habits and when I left him was as strict a specimen of temperance as could be found on Bayou Boeuf When in his Cups Master Epps was a roystering blustering noisy fellow whose chief delight was in dancing with his niggers or lashing them about the yard with his long whip just for the pleasure of hearing them screech and scream as the great welts were planted on their backs When sober he was silent reserved and cunning not beating us indiscriminately as in his drunken moments but sending the end of his rawhide to some tender spot of a lagging slave with a sly dexterity peculiar to himself He had been a driver and overseer in his younger years but at this time was in possession of a plantation on Bayou Huff Power two and a half miles from Holmesville eighteen from Marksville and twelve from Cheneyville It belonged to Joseph B Roberts his wife's uncle and was leased by Epps His principal business was raising cotton and inasmuch as some may read this book who have never seen a cotton field a description of the manner of its culture may not be out of place The ground is prepared by throwing up beds or ridges with the plough back furrowing it is called Oxen and mules the latter almost exclusively are used in ploughing The women as frequently as the men perform this labor feeding currying and taking care of their teams and in all respects doing the field and stable work precisely as do the ploughboys of the North The beds or ridges are six feet wide that is from water furrow to water furrow A plough drawn by one mule is then run along the top of the ridge or center of the bed making the drill into which a girl usually drops the seed which she carries in a bag hung round her neck Behind her comes a mule and harrow covering up the seed so that two mules three slaves a plough and harrow are employed in planting a row of cotton This is done in the months of March and April Corn is planted in February When there are no cold rains the cotton usually makes its appearance in a week In the course of eight or ten days afterwards the first hoeing is commenced This is performed in part also by the aid of the plough and mule The plough passes as near as possible to the cotton on both sides throwing the furrow from it Slaves follow with their hoes cutting up the grass and cotton leaving hills two feet and a half apart This is called scraping cotton In two weeks more commences the second hoeing This time the furrow is thrown towards the cotton Only one stalk the largest is now left standing in each hill In another fortnight it is hoed the third time throwing the furrow towards the cotton in the same manner as before and killing all the grass between the rows About the first of July when it is a foot high or thereabouts it is hoed the fourth and last time Now the whole space between the rows is ploughed leaving a deep water furrow in the center During all these hoeings the overseer or driver follows the slaves on horseback with a whip such as has been described The fastest hoer takes the lead row He is usually about a rod in advance of his companions If one of them passes him he is whipped If one falls behind or is a moment idle he is whipped In fact the lash is flying from morning until night the whole day long The hoeing season thus continues from April until July a field having no sooner been finished once than it is commenced again In the latter part of August begins the cotton picking season At this time each slave is presented with a sack A strap is fastened to it which goes over the neck holding the mouth of the sack breast high while the bottom reaches nearly to the ground Each one is also presented with a large basket that will hold about two barrels This is to put the cotton in when the sack is filled The baskets are carried to the field and placed at the beginning of the rows When a new hand one unaccustomed to the business is sent for the first time into the field he is whipped up smartly and made for that day to pick as fast as he can possibly At night it is weighed so that his capability in cotton picking is known He must bring in the same weight each night following If it falls short it is considered evidence that he has been laggard and a greater or less number of lashes is the penalty An ordinary day's work is two hundred pounds A slave who is accustomed to picking is punished if he or she brings in a less quantity than that There is a great difference among them as regards this kind of labor Some of them seem to have a natural knack or quickness which enables them to pick with great celerity and with both hands while others with whatever practice or industry are utterly unable to come up to the ordinary standard Such hands are taken from the cotton field and employed in other business Patsey of whom I shall have more to say was known as the most remarkable cotton picker on Bayou Boeuf She picked with both hands and with such surprising rapidity that five hundred pounds a day was not unusual for her Each one is tasked therefore according to his picking abilities none however to come short of two hundred weight I being unskillful always in that business would have satisfied my master by bringing in the latter quantity while on the other hand Patsey would surely have been beaten if she failed to produce twice as much The cotton grows from five to seven feet high each stalk having a great many branches shooting out in all directions and lapping each other above the water furrow There are few sights more pleasant to the eye than a wide cotton field when it is in the bloom It presents an appearance of purity like an immaculate expanse of light new fallen snow Sometimes the slave picks down one side of a row and back upon the other but more usually there is one on either side gathering all that has blossomed leaving the unopened boils for a succeeding picking When the sack is filled it is emptied into the basket and trodden down It is necessary to be extremely careful the first time going through the field in order not to break the branches off the stalks The cotton will not bloom upon a broken branch Epps never failed to inflict the severest chastisement on the unlucky servant who either carelessly or unavoidably was guilty in the least degree in this respect The hands are required to be in the cotton field as soon as it is light in the morning and with the exception of ten or fifteen minutes which is given them at noon to swallow their allowance of cold bacon they are not permitted to be a moment idle until it is too dark to see and when the moon is full they often times labor till the middle of the night They do not dare to stop even at dinner time nor return to the quarters however late it be until the order to halt is given by the driver The day's work over in the field the baskets are toted or in other words carried to the gin house where the cotton is weighed No matter how fatigued and weary he may be no matter how much he longs for sleep and rest a slave never approaches the gin house with his basket of cotton but with fear If it falls short in weight if he has not performed the full task appointed him he knows that he must suffer And if he has exceeded it by ten or twenty pounds in all probability his master will measure the next day's task accordingly So whether he has too little or too much his approach to the gin house is always with fear and trembling Most frequently they have too little and therefore it is they are not anxious to leave the field After weighing follow the whippings and then the baskets are carried to the cotton house and their contents stored away like hay all hands being sent in to tramp it down If the cotton is not dry instead of taking it to the gin house at once it is laid upon platforms two feet high and some three times as wide covered with boards or plank with narrow walks running between them This done the labor of the day is not yet ended by any means Each one must then attend to his respective chores One feeds the mules another the swine another cuts the wood and so forth besides the packing is all done by candle light Finally at a late hour they reach the quarters sleepy and overcome with the long day's toil Then a fire must be kindled in the cabin the corn ground in the small hand mill and supper and dinner for the next day in the field prepared All that is allowed them is corn and bacon which is given out at the corncrib and smoke house every Sunday morning Each one receives as his weekly allowance three and a half pounds of bacon and corn enough to make a peck of meal That is all no tea coffee sugar and with the exception of a very scanty sprinkling now and then no salt I can say from a ten years' residence with Master Epps that no slave of his is ever likely to suffer from the gout superinduced by excessive high living Master Epps' hogs were fed on shelled corn it was thrown out to his niggers in the ear The former he thought would fatten faster by shelling and soaking it in the water the latter perhaps if treated in the same manner might grow too fat to labor Master Epps was a shrewd calculator and knew how to manage his own animals drunk or sober The corn mill stands in the yard beneath a shelter It is like a common coffee mill the hopper holding about six quarts There was one privilege which Master Epps granted freely to every slave he had They might grind their corn nightly in such small quantities as their daily wants required or they might grind the whole week's allowance at one time on Sundays just as they preferred A very generous man was Master Epps I kept my corn in a small wooden box the meal in a gourd and by the way the gourd is one of the most convenient and necessary utensils on a plantation Besides supplying the place of all kinds of crockery in a slave cabin it is used for carrying water to the fields Another also contains the dinner It dispenses with the necessity of pails dippers basins and such tin and wooden superfluities altogether When the corn is ground and fire is made the bacon is taken down from the nail on which it hangs a slice cut off and thrown upon the coals to broil The majority of slaves have no knife much less a fork They cut their bacon with the axe at the woodpile The corn meal is mixed with a little water placed in the fire and baked When it is done brown the ashes are scraped off and being placed upon a chip which answers for a table the tenant of the slave hut is ready to sit down upon the ground to supper By this time it is usually midnight The same fear of punishment with which they approach the gin house possesses them again on lying down to get a snatch of rest It is the fear of oversleeping in the morning Such an offence would certainly be attended with not less than twenty lashes With a prayer that he may be on his feet and wide awake at the first sound of the horn he sinks to his slumbers nightly The softest couches in the world are not to be found in the log mansion of the slave The one whereon I reclined year after year was a plank twelve inches wide and ten feet long My pillow was a stick of wood The bedding was a coarse blanket and not a rag or shred beside Moss might be used were it not that it directly breeds a swarm of fleas The cabin is constructed of logs without floor or window The latter is altogether unnecessary the crevices between the logs admitting sufficient light In stormy weather the rain drives through them rendering it comfortless and extremely disagreeable The rude door hangs on great wooden hinges In one end is constructed an awkward fire place An hour before day light the horn is blown Then the slaves arouse prepare their breakfast fill a gourd with water in another deposit their dinner of cold bacon and corn cake and hurry to the field again It is an offence invariably followed by a flogging to be found at the quarters after daybreak Then the fears and labors of another day begin and until its close there is no such thing as rest He fears he will be caught lagging through the day he fears to approach the gin house with his basket load of cotton at night he fears when he lies down that he will oversleep himself in the morning Such is a true faithful unexaggerated picture and description of the slave's daily life during the time of cotton picking on the shores of Bayou Boeuf In the month of January generally the fourth and last picking is completed Then commences the harvesting of corn This is considered a secondary crop and receives far less attention than the cotton It is planted as already mentioned in February Corn is grown in that region for the purpose of fattening hogs and feeding slaves very little if any being sent to market It is the white variety the ear of great size and the stalk growing to the height of eight and often times ten feet In August the leaves are stripped off dried in the sun bound in small bundles and stored away as provender for the mules and oxen After this the slaves go through the field turning down the ear for the purpose of keeping the rains from penetrating to the grain It is left in this condition until after cotton picking is over whether earlier or later Then the ears are separated from the stalks and deposited in the corncrib with the husks on otherwise stripped of the husks the weevil would destroy it The stalks are left standing in the field The Carolina or sweet potato is also grown in that region to some extent They are not fed however to hogs or cattle and are considered but of small importance They are preserved by placing them upon the surface of the ground with a slight covering of earth or cornstalks There is not a cellar on Bayou Boeuf The ground is so low it would fill with water Potatoes are worth from two to three bits or shillings a barrel corn except when there is an unusual scarcity can be purchased at the same rate As soon as the cotton and corn crops are secured the stalks are pulled up thrown into piles and burned The ploughs are started at the same time throwing up the beds again preparatory to another planting The soil in the parishes of Rapides and Avoyelles and throughout the whole country so far as my observation extended is of exceeding richness and fertility It is a kind of marl of a brown or reddish color It does not require those invigorating composts necessary to more barren lands and on the same field the same crop is grown for many successive years Ploughing planting picking cotton gathering the corn and pulling and burning stalks occupies the whole of the four seasons of the year Drawing and cutting wood pressing cotton fattening and killing hog's are but incidental labors In the month of September or October the hogs are run out of the swamps by dogs and confined in pens On a cold morning generally about New Year's day they are slaughtered Each carcass is cut into six parts and piled one above the other in salt upon large tables in the smoke house In this condition it remains a fortnight when it is hung up and a fire built and continued more than half the time during the remainder of the year This thorough smoking is necessary to prevent the bacon from becoming infested with worms In so warm a climate it is difficult to preserve it and very many times myself and my companions have received our weekly allowance of three pounds and a half when it was full of these disgusting vermin Although the swamps are overrun with cattle they are never made the source of profit to any considerable extent The planter cuts his mark upon the ear or brands his initials upon the side and turns them into the swamps to roam unrestricted within their almost limitless confines They are the Spanish breed small and spike horned I have known of droves being taken from Bayou Boeuf but it is of very rare occurrence The value of the best cows is about five dollars each Two quarts at one milking would be considered an unusual large quantity They furnish little tallow and that of a soft inferior quality Notwithstanding the great number of cows that throng the swamps the planters are indebted to the North for their cheese and butter which is purchased in the New Orleans market Salted beef is not an article of food either in the great house or in the cabin Master Epps was accustomed to attend shooting matches for the purpose of obtaining what fresh beef he required These sports occurred weekly at the neighboring village of Holmesville Fat beeves are driven thither and shot at a stipulated price being demanded for the privilege The lucky marksman divides the flesh among his fellows and in this manner the attending planters are supplied The great number of tame and untamed cattle which swarm the woods and swamps of Bayou Boeuf most probably suggested that appellation to the French inasmuch as the term translated signifies the creek or river of the wild ox Garden products such as cabbages turnips and the like are cultivated for the use of the master and his family They have greens and vegetables at all times and seasons of the year The grass withereth and the flower fadeth before the desolating winds of autumn in the chill northern latitudes but perpetual verdure overspreads the hot lowlands and flowers bloom in the heart of winter in the region of Bayou Boeuf There are no meadows appropriated to the cultivation of the grasses The leaves of the corn supply a sufficiency of food for the laboring cattle while the rest provide for themselves all the year in the evergrowing pasture There are many other peculiarities of climate habit custom and of the manner of living and laboring at the South but the foregoing it is supposed will give the reader an insight and general idea of life on a cotton plantation in Louisiana The mode of cultivating cane and the process of sugar manufacturing will be mentioned in another place XIII THE CURIOUS AXE HELVE SYMPTOMS OF APPROACHING ILLNESS CONTINUE TO DECLINE THE WHIP INEFFECTUAL CONFINED TO THE CABIN VISIT BY DR WINES ART PARTIAL RECOVERY FAILURE AT COTTON PICKING WHAT MAY BE HEARD ON EPPS' PLANTATION LASHES GRADUATED EPPS IN A WHIPPING MOOD EPPS IN A DANCING MOOD DESCRIPTION OF THE DANCE LOSS OF REST NO EXCUSE EPPS' CHARACTERISTICS JIM BURNS REMOVAL FROM HUFF POWER TO BAYOU BOEUF DESCRIPTION OF UNCLE ABRAM OF WILEY OF AUNT PHEBE OF BOB HENRY AND EDWARD OF PETSEY WITH A GENEALOGICAL ACCOUNT OF EACH SOMETHING OF THEIR PAST HISTORY AND PECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS JEALOUSY AND LUST PATSEY THE VICTIM On my arrival at Master Epps' in obedience to his order the first business upon which I entered was the making of an axe halve The handles in use there are simply a round straight stick I made a crooked one shaped like those to which I had been accustomed at the North When finished and presented to Epps he looked at it with astonishment unable to determine exactly what it was He had never before seen such a handle and when I explained its conveniences he was forcibly struck with the novelty of the idea He kept it in the house a long time and when his friends called was wont to exhibit it as a curiosity It was now the season of hoeing I was first sent into the corn field and afterwards set to scraping cotton In this employment I remained until hoeing time was nearly passed when I began to experience the symptoms of approaching illness I was attacked with chills which were succeeded by a burning fever I became weak and emaciated and frequently so dizzy that it caused me to reel and stagger like a drunken man Nevertheless I was compelled to keep up my row When in health I found little difficulty in keeping pace with my fellow laborers but now it seemed to be an utter impossibility Often I fell behind when the driver's lash was sure to greet my back infusing into my sick and drooping body a little temporary energy I continued to decline until at length the whip became entirely ineffectual The sharpest sting of the rawhide could not arouse me Finally in September when the busy season of cotton picking was at hand I was unable to leave my cabin Up to this time I had received no medicine nor any attention from my master or mistress The old cook visited me occasionally preparing me corn coffee and sometimes boiling a bit of bacon when I had grown too feeble to accomplish it myself When it was said that I would die Master Epps unwilling to bear the loss which the death of an animal worth a thousand dollars would bring upon him concluded to incur the expense of sending to Holmesville for Dr Wines He announced to Epps that it was the effect of the climate and there was a probability of his losing me He directed me to eat no meat and to partake of no more food than was absolutely necessary to sustain life Several weeks elapsed during which time under the scanty diet to which I was subjected I had partially recovered One morning long before I was in a proper condition to labor Epps appeared at the cabin door and presenting me a sack ordered me to the cotton field At this time I had had no experience whatever in cotton picking It was an awkward business indeed While others used both hands snatching the cotton and depositing it in the mouth of the sack with a precision and dexterity that was incomprehensible to me I had to seize the boll with one hand and deliberately draw out the white gushing blossom with the other Depositing the cotton in the sack moreover was a difficulty that demanded the exercise of both hand and eyes I was compelled to pick it from the ground where it would fall nearly as often as from the stalk where it had grown I made havoc also with the branches loaded with the yet unbroken bolls the long cumbersome sack swinging from side to side in a manner not allowable in the cotton field After a most laborious day I arrived at the gin house with my load When the scale determined its weight to be only ninety five pounds not half the quantity required of the poorest picker Epps threatened the severest flogging but in consideration of my being a raw hand concluded to pardon me on that occasion The following day and many days succeeding I returned at night with no better success I was evidently not designed for that kind of labor I had not the gift the dexterous fingers and quick motion of Patsey who could fly along one side of a row of cotton stripping it of its undefiled and fleecy whiteness miraculously fast Practice and whipping were alike unavailing and Epps satisfied of it at last swore I was a disgrace that I was not fit to associate with a cotton picking nigger that I could not pick enough in a day to pay the trouble of weighing it and that I should go into the cotton field no more I was now employed in cutting and hauling wood drawing cotton from the field to the gin house and performed whatever other service was required Suffice to say I was never permitted to be idle It was rarely that a day passed by without one or more whippings This occurred at the time the cotton was weighed The delinquent whose weight had fallen short was taken out stripped made to lie upon the ground face downwards when he received a punishment proportioned to his offence It is the literal unvarnished truth that the crack of the lash and the shrieking of the slaves can be heard from dark till bed time on Epps' plantation any day almost during the entire period of the cotton picking season The number of lashes is graduated according to the nature of the case Twenty five are deemed a mere brush inflicted for instance when a dry leaf or piece of boll is found in the cotton or when a branch is broken in the field fifty is the ordinary penalty following all delinquencies of the next higher grade one hundred is called severe it is the punishment inflicted for the serious offence of standing idle in the field from one hundred and fifty to two hundred is bestowed upon him who quarrels with his cabin mates and five hundred well laid on besides the mangling of the dogs perhaps is certain to consign the poor unpitied runaway to weeks of pain and agony During the two years Epps remained on the plantation at Bayou Huff Power he was in the habit as often as once in a fortnight at least of coming home intoxicated from Holmesville The shooting matches almost invariably concluded with a debauch At such times he was boisterous and half crazy Often he would break the dishes chairs and whatever furniture he could lay his hands on When satisfied with his amusement in the house he would seize the whip and walk forth into the yard Then it behooved the slaves to be watchful and exceeding wary The first one who came within reach felt the smart of his lash Sometimes for hours he would keep them running in all directions dodging around the corners of the cabins Occasionally he would come upon one unawares and if he succeeded in inflicting a fair round blow it was a feat that much delighted him The younger children and the aged who had become inactive suffered then In the midst of the confusion he would slily take his stand behind a cabin waiting with raised whip to dash it into the first black face that peeped cautiously around the corner At other times he would come home in a less brutal humor Then there must be a merry making Then all must move to the measure of a tune Then Master Epps must needs regale his melodious ears with the music of a fiddle Then did he become buoyant elastic gaily tripping the light fantastic toe around the piazza and all thorough the house Tibeats at the time of my sale had informed him I could play on the violin He had received his information from Ford Through the importunities of Mistress Epps her husband had been induced to purchase me one during a visit to New Orleans Frequently I was called into the house to play before the family mistress being passionately fond of music All of us would be assembled in the large room of the great house whenever Epps came home in one of his dancing moods No matter how worn out and tired we were there must be a general dance When properly stationed on the floor I would strike up a tune Dance you d d niggers dance Epps would shout Then there must be no halting or delay no slow or languid movements all must be brisk and lively and alert Up and down heel and toe and away we go was the order of the hour Epps' portly form mingled with those of his dusky slaves moving rapidly through all the mazes of the dance Usually his whip was in his hand ready to fall about the ears of the presumptuous thrall who dared to rest a moment or even stop to catch his breath When he was himself exhausted there would be a brief cessation but it would be very brief With a slash and crack and flourish of the whip he would shout again Dance niggers dance and away they would go once more pell mell while I spurred by an occasional sharp touch of the lash sat in a corner extracting from my violin a marvelous quick stepping tune The mistress often upbraided him declaring she would return to her father's house at Cheneyville nevertheless there were times she could not restrain a burst of laughter on witnessing his uproarious pranks Frequently we were thus detained until almost morning Bent with excessive toil actually suffering for a little refreshing rest and feeling rather as if we could cast ourselves upon the earth and weep many a night in the house of Edwin Epps have his unhappy slaves been made to dance and laugh Notwithstanding these deprivations in order to gratify the whim of an unreasonable master we had to be in the field as soon as it was light and during the day perform the ordinary and accustomed task Such deprivations could not be urged at the scales in extenuation of any lack of weight or in the cornfield for not hoeing with the usual rapidity The whippings were just as severe as if we had gone forth in the morning strengthened and invigorated by a night's repose Indeed after such frantic revels he was always more sour and savage than before punishing for slighter causes and using the whip with increased and more vindictive energy Ten years I toiled for that man without reward Ten years of my incessant labor has contributed to increase the bulk of his possessions Ten years I was compelled to address him with down cast eyes and uncovered head in the attitude and language of a slave I am indebted to him for nothing save undeserved abuse and stripes Beyond the reach of his inhuman thong and standing on the soil of the free State where I was born thanks be to Heaven I can raise my head once more among men I can speak of the wrongs I have suffered and of those who inflicted them with upraised eyes But I have no desire to speak of him or any other one otherwise than truthfully Yet to speak truthfully of Edwin Epps would be to say he is a man in whose heart the quality of kindness or of justice is not found A rough rude energy united with an uncultivated mind and an avaricious spirit are his prominent characteristics He is known as a nigger breaker distinguished for his faculty of subduing the spirit of the slave and priding himself upon his reputation in this respect as a jockey boasts of his skill in managing a refractory horse He looked upon a colored man not as a human being responsible to his Creator for the small talent entrusted to him but as a chattel personal as mere live property no better except in value than his mule or dog When the evidence clear and indisputable was laid before him that I was a free man and as much entitled to my liberty as he when on the day I left he was informed that I had a wife and children as dear to me as his own babes to him he only raved and swore denouncing the law that tore me from him and declaring he would find out the man who had forwarded the letter that disclosed the place of my captivity if there was any virtue or power in money and would take his life He thought of nothing but his loss and cursed me for having been born free He could have stood unmoved and seen the tongues of his poor slaves torn out by the roots he could have seen them burned to ashes over a slow fire or gnawed to death by dogs if it only brought him profit Such a hard cruel unjust man is Edwin Epps There was but one greater savage on Bayou Boeuf than he Jim Burns' plantation was cultivated as already mentioned exclusively by women That barbarian kept their backs so sore and raw that they could not perform the customary labor demanded daily of the slave He boasted of his cruelty and through all the country round was accounted a more thorough going energetic man than even Epps A brute himself Jim Burns had not a particle of mercy for his subject brutes and like a fool whipped and scourged away the very strength upon which depended his amount of gain Epps remained on Huff Power two years when having accumulated a considerable sum of money he expended it in the purchase of the plantation on the east bank of Bayou Boeuf where he still continues to reside He took possession of it in after the holidays were passed He carried thither with him nine slaves all of whom except myself and Susan who has since died remain there yet He made no addition to this force and for eight years the following were my companions in his quarters viz Abram Wiley Phebe Bob Henry Edward and Patsey All these except Edward born since were purchased out of a drove by Epps during the time he was overseer for Archy B Williams whose plantation is situated on the shore of Red River not far from Alexandria Abram was tall standing a full head above any common man He is sixty years of age and was born in Tennessee Twenty years ago he was purchased by a trader carried into South Carolina and sold to James Buford of Williamsburgh county in that State In his youth he was renowned for his great strength but age and unremitting toil have somewhat shattered his powerful frame and enfeebled his mental faculties Wiley is forty eight He was born on the estate of William Tassle and for many years took charge of that gentleman's ferry over the Big Black River in South Carolina Phebe was a slave of Buford Tassle's neighbor and having married Wiley he bought the latter at her instigation Buford was a kind master sheriff of the county and in those days a man of wealth Bob and Henry are Phebe's children by a former husband their father having been abandoned to give place to Wiley That seductive youth had insinuated himself into Phebe's affections and therefore the faithless spouse had gently kicked her first husband out of her cabin door Edward had been born to them on Bayou Huff Power Patsey is twenty three also from Buford's plantation She is in no wise connected with the others but glories in the fact that she is the offspring of a Guinea nigger brought over to Cuba in a slave ship and in the course of trade transferred to Buford who was her mother's owner This as I learned from them is a genealogical account of my master's shaves For years they had been together Often they recalled the memories of other days and sighed to retrace their steps to the old home in Carolina Troubles came upon their master Buford which brought far greater troubles upon them He became involved in debt and unable to bear up against his failing fortunes was compelled to sell these and others of his slaves In a chain gang they had been driven from beyond the Mississippi to the plantation of Archy B Williams Edwin Epps who for a long while had been his driver and overseer was about establishing himself in business on his own account at the time of their arrival and accepted them in payment of his wages Old Abram was a kind hearted being a sort of patriarch among us fond of entertaining his younger brethren with grave and serious discourse He was deeply versed in such philosophy as is taught in the cabin of the slave but the great absorbing hobby of Uncle Abram was General Jackson whom his young master in Tennessee had followed to the wars He loved to wander back in imagination to the place where he was born and to recount the scenes of his youth during those stirring times when the nation was in arms He had been athletic and more keen and powerful than the generality of his race but now his eye had become dim and his natural force abated Very often indeed while discussing the best method of baking the hoe cake or expatiating at large upon the glory of Jackson he would forget where he left his hat or his hoe or his basket and then would the old man be laughed at if Epps was absent and whipped if he was present So was he perplexed continually and sighed to think that he was growing aged and going to decay Philosophy and Jackson and forgetfulness had played the mischief with him and it was evident that all of them combined were fast bringing down the gray hairs of Uncle Abram to the grave Aunt Phebe had been an excellent field hand but latterly was put into the kitchen where she remained except occasionally in a time of uncommon hurry She was a sly old creature and when not in the presence of her mistress or her master was garrulous in the extreme Wiley on the contrary was silent He performed his task without murmur or complaint seldom indulging in the luxury of speech except to utter a wish that he was away from Epps and back once more in South Carolina Bob and Henry had reached the ages of twenty and twenty three and were distinguished for nothing extraordinary or unusual while Edward a lad of thirteen not yet able to maintain his row in the corn or the cotton field was kept in the great house to wait on the little Eppses Patsey was slim and straight She stood erect as the human form is capable of standing There was an air of loftiness in her movement that neither labor nor weariness nor punishment could destroy Truly Patsey was a splendid animal and were it not that bondage had enshrouded her intellect in utter and everlasting darkness would have been chief among ten thousand of her people She could leap the highest fences and a fleet hound it was indeed that could outstrip her in a race No horse could fling her from his back She was a skillful teamster She turned as true a furrow as the best and at splitting rails there were none who could excel her When the order to halt was heard at night she would have her mules at the crib unharnessed fed and curried before uncle Abram had found his hat Not however for all or any of these was she chiefly famous Such lightning like motion was in her fingers as no other fingers ever possessed and therefore it was that in cotton picking time Patsey was queen of the field She had a genial and pleasant temper and was faithful and obedient Naturally she was a joyous creature a laughing light hearted girl rejoicing in the mere sense of existence Yet Patsey wept oftener and suffered more than any of her companions She had been literally excoriated Her back bore the scars of a thousand stripes not because she was backward in her work nor because she was of an unmindful and rebellious spirit but because it had fallen to her lot to be the slave of a licentious master and a jealous mistress She shrank before the lustful eye of the one and was in danger even of her life at the hands of the other and between the two she was indeed accursed In the great house for days together there were high and angry words poutings and estrangement whereof she was the innocent cause Nothing delighted the mistress so much as to see her suffer and more than once when Epps had refused to sell her has she tempted me with bribes to put her secretly to death and bury her body in some lonely place in the margin of the swamp Gladly would Patsey have appeased this unforgiving spirit if it had been in her power but not like Joseph dared she escape from Master Epps leaving her garment in his hand Patsey walked under a cloud If she uttered a word in opposition to her master's will the lash was resorted to at once to bring her to subjection if she was not watchful when about her cabin or when walking in the yard a billet of wood or a broken bottle perhaps hurled from her mistress' hand would smite her unexpectedly in the face The enslaved victim of lust and hate Patsey had no comfort of her life These were my companions and fellow slaves with whom I was accustomed to be driven to the field and with whom it has been my lot to dwell for ten years in the log cabins of Edwin Epps They if living are yet toiling on the banks of Bayou Boeuf never destined to breathe as I now do the blessed air of liberty nor to shake off the heavy shackles that enthrall them until they shall lie down forever in the dust XIV DESTRUCTION OF THE COTTON CROP IN DEMAND FOR LABORERS IN ST MARY'S PARISH SENT THITHER IN A DROVE THE ORDER OF THE

OF THE SLAVE DESCRIPTION OF THE FISH TRAP THE MURDER OF THE MAN FROM NATCHEZ EPPS CHALENGED BY MARSHALL THE INFLUENCE OF SLAVERY THE LOVE OF FREEDOM THE first year of Epps' residence on the bayou the caterpillars almost totally destroyed the cotton crop throughout that region There was little to be done so that the slaves were necessarily idle half the time However there came a rumor to Bayou Boeuf that wages were high and laborers in great demand on the sugar plantations in St Mary's parish This parish is situated on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico about one hundred and forty miles from Avoyelles The Rio Teche a considerable stream flows through St Mary's to the gulf It was determined by the planters on the receipt of this intelligence to make up a drove of slaves to be sent down to Tuckapaw in St Mary's for the purpose of hiring them out in the cane fields Accordingly in the month of September there were one hundred and forty seven collected at Holmesville Abram Bob and myself among the number Of these about one half were women Epps Alonson Pierce Henry Toler and Addison Roberts were the white men selected to accompany and take charge of the drove They had a two horse carriage and two saddle horses for their use A large wagon drawn by four horses and driven by John a boy belonging to Mr Roberts carried the blankets and provisions About o'clock in the afternoon having been fed preparations were made to depart The duty assigned me was to take charge of the blankets and provisions and see that none were lost by the way The carriage proceeded in advance the wagon following behind this the slaves were arranged while the two horsemen brought up the rear and in this order the procession moved out of Holmesville That night we reached a Mr McCrow's plantation a distance of ten or fifteen miles when we were ordered to halt Large fires were built and each one spreading his blanket on the ground laid down upon it The white men lodged in the great house An hour before day we were aroused by the drivers coming among us cracking their whips and ordering us to arise Then the blankets were rolled up and being severally delivered to me and deposited in the wagon the procession set forth again The following night it rained violently We were all drenched our clothes saturated with mud and water Reaching an open shed formerly a gin house we found beneath it such shelter as it afforded There was not room for all of us to lay down There we remained huddled together through the night continuing our march as usual in the morning During the journey we were fed twice a day boiling our bacon and baking our corn cake at the fires in the same manner as in our huts We passed through Lafayetteville Mountsville New Town to Centreville where Bob and Uncle Abram were hired Our number decreased as we advanced nearly every sugar plantation requiring the services of one or more On our route we passed the Grand Coteau or prairie a vast space of level monotonous country without a tree except an occasional one which had been transplanted near some dilapidated dwelling It was once thickly populated and under cultivation but for some cause had been abandoned The business of the scattered inhabitants that now dwell upon it is principally raising cattle Immense herds were feeding upon it as we passed In the centre of the Grand Coteau one feels as if he were on the ocean out of sight of land As far as the eye can see in all directions it is but a ruined and deserted waste I was hired to Judge Turner a distinguished man and extensive planter whose large estate is situated on Bayou Salle within a few miles of the gulf Bayou Salle is a small stream flowing into the bay of Atchafalaya For some days I was employed at Turner's in repairing his sugar house when a cane knife was put into my hand and with thirty or forty others I was sent into the field I found no such difficulty in learning the art of cutting cane that I had in picking cotton It came to me naturally and intuitively and in a short time I was able to keep up with the fastest knife Before the cutting was over however Judge Tanner transferred me from the field to the sugar house to act there in the capacity of driver From the time of the commencement of sugar making to the close the grinding and boiling does not cease day or night The whip was given me with directions to use it upon any one who was caught standing idle If I failed to obey them to the letter there was another one for my own back In addition to this my duty was to call on and off the different gangs at the proper time I had no regular periods of rest and could never snatch but a few moments of sleep at a time It is the custom in Louisiana as I presume it is in other slave States to allow the slave to retain whatever compensation he may obtain for services performed on Sundays In this way only are they able to provide themselves with any luxury or convenience whatever When a slave purchased or kidnapped in the North is transported to a cabin on Bayou Boeuf he is furnished with neither knife nor fork nor dish nor kettle nor any other thing in the shape of crockery or furniture of any nature or description He is furnished with a blanket before he reaches there and wrapping that around him he can either stand up or lie down upon the ground or on a board if his master has no use for it He is at liberty to find a gourd in which to keep his meal or he can eat his corn from the cob just as he pleases To ask the master for a knife or skillet or any small convenience of the kind would be answered with a kick or laughed at as a joke Whatever necessary article of this nature is found in a cabin has been purchased with Sunday money However injurious to the morals it is certainly a blessing to the physical condition of the slave to be permitted to break the Sabbath Otherwise there would be no way to provide himself with any utensils which seem to be indispensable to him who is compelled to be his own cook On cane plantations in sugar time there is no distinction as to the days of the week It is well understood that all hands must labor on the Sabbath and it is equally well understood that those especially who are hired as I was to Judge Turner and others in succeeding years shall receive remuneration for it It is usual also in the most hurrying time of cotton picking to require the same extra service From this source slaves generally are afforded an opportunity of earning sufficient to purchase a knife a kettle tobacco and so forth The females discarding the latter luxury are apt to expend their little revenue in the purchase of gaudy ribbons wherewithal to deck their hair in the merry season of the holidays I remained in St Mary's until the first of January during which time my Sunday money amounted to ten dollars I met with other good fortune for which I was indebted to my violin my constant companion the source of profit and soother of my sorrows during years of servitude There was a grand party of whites assembled at Mr Yarney's in Centreville a hamlet in the vicinity of Turner's plantation I was employed to play for them and so well pleased were the merry makers with my performance that a contribution was taken for my benefit which amounted to seventeen dollars With this sum in possession I was looked upon by my fellows as a millionaire It afforded me great pleasure to look at it to count it over and over again day after day Visions of cabin furniture of water pails of pocket knives new shoes and coats and hats floated through my fancy and up through all rose the triumphant contemplation that I was the wealthiest nigger on Bayou Boeuf Vessels run up the Rio Teche to Centreville While there I was bold enough one day to present myself before the captain of a steamer and beg permission to hide myself among the freight I was emboldened to risk the hazard of such a step from overhearing a conversation in the course of which I ascertained he was a native of tile North I did not relate to him the particulars of my history but only expressed an ardent desire to escape from slavery to a free State He pitied me but said it would be impossible to avoid the vigilant custom house officers in New Orleans and that detection would subject him to punishment and his vessel to confiscation My earnest entreaties evidently excited his sympathies and doubtless he would have yielded to them could he have done so with any kind of safety I was compelled to smother the sudden flame that lighted up my bosom with sweet hopes of liberation and turn my steps once more towards the increasing darkness of despair Immediately after this event the drove assembled at Centreville and several of the owners having arrived and collected the monies due for our services we were driven back to Bayou Boeuf It was on our return while passing through a small village that I caught sight of Tibeats seated in the door of a dirty grocery looking somewhat seedy and out of repair Passion and poor whisky I doubt not have ere this laid him on the shelf During our absence I learned from Aunt Phebe and Patsey that the latter had been getting deeper and deeper into trouble The poor girl was truly an object of pity Old Hogjaw the name by which Epps was called when the slaves were by themselves had beaten her more severely and frequently than ever As surely as he came from Holmesville elated with liquor and it was often in those days he would whip her merely to gratify the mistress would punish her to an extent almost beyond endurance for an offence of which he himself was the sole and irresistible cause In his sober moments he could not always be prevailed upon to indulge his wife's insatiable thirst for vengeance To be rid of Patsey to place her beyond sight or reach by sale or death or in any other manner of late years seemed to be the ruling thought and passion of my mistress Patsey had been a favorite when a child even in the great house She had been petted and admired for her uncommon sprightliness and pleasant disposition She had been fed many a time so Uncle Abram said even on biscuit and milk when the madam in her younger days was wont to call her to the piazza and fondle her as she would a playful kitten But a sad change had come over the spirit of the woman Now only black and angry fiends ministered in the temple of her heart until she could look on Patsey but with concentrated venom Mistress Epps was not naturally such an evil woman after all She was possessed of the devil jealousy it is true but aside from that there was much in her character to admire Her father Mr Roberts resided in Cheneyville an influential and honorable man and as much respected throughout the parish as any other citizen She had been well educated at some institution this side the Mississippi was beautiful accomplished and usually good humored She was kind to all of us but Patsey frequently in the absence of her husband sending out to us some little dainty from her own table In other situations in a different society from that which exists on the shores of Bayou Boeuf she would have been pronounced an elegant and fascinating woman An ill wind it was that blew her into the arms of Epps He respected and loved his wife as much as a coarse nature like his is capable of loving but supreme selfishness always overmastered conjugal affection He loved as well as baser natures can But a mean heart and soul were in that man He was ready to gratify any whim to grant any request she made provided it did not cost too much Patsey was equal to any two of his slaves in the cotton field He could not replace her with the same money she would bring The idea of disposing of her therefore could not be entertained The mistress did not regard her at all in that light The pride of the haughty woman was aroused the blood of the fiery southern boiled at the sight of Patsey and nothing less than trampling out the life of the helpless bondwoman would satisfy her Sometimes the current of her wrath turned upon him whom she had just cause to hate But the storm of angry words would pass over at length and there would be a season of calm again At such times Patsey trembled with fear and cried as if her heart would break for she knew from painful experience that if mistress should work herself to the red hot pitch of rage Epps would quiet her at last with a promise that Patsey should be flogged a promise he was sure to keep Thus did pride and jealousy and vengeance war with avarice and brute passion in the mansion of my master filling it with daily tumult and contention Thus upon the head of Patsey the simpleminded slave in whose heart God had implanted the seeds of virtue the force of all these domestic tempests spent itself at last During the summer succeeding my return from St Mary's parish I conceived a plan of providing myself with food which though simple succeeded beyond expectation It has been followed by many others in my condition up and down the bayou and of such benefit has it become that I am almost persuaded to look upon myself as a benefactor That summer the worms got into the bacon Nothing but ravenous hunger could induce us to swallow it The weekly allowance of meal scarcely sufficed to satisfy us It was customary with us as it is with all in that region where the allowance is exhausted before Saturday night or is in such a state as to render it nauseous and disgusting to hunt in the swamps for coon and opossum This however must be done at night after the day's work is accomplished There are planters whose slaves for months at a time have no other meat than such as is obtained in this manner No objections are made to hunting inasmuch as it dispenses with drafts upon the smoke house and because every marauding coon that is killed is so much saved from the standing corn They are hunted with dogs and clubs slaves not being allowed the use of fire arms The flesh of the coon is palatable but verily there is nothing in all butcherdom so delicious as a roasted 'possum They are a round rather long bodied little animal of a whitish color with nose like a pig and caudal extremity like a rat They burrow among the roots and in the hollows of the gum tree and are clumsy and slow of motion They are deceitful and cunning creatures On receiving the slightest tap of a stick they will roll over on the ground and feign death If the hunter leaves him in pursuit of another without first taking particular pains to break his neck the chances are on his return he is not to be found The little animal has out witted the enemy has played 'possum and is off But after a long and hard day's work the weary slave feels little like going to the swamp for his supper and half the time prefers throwing himself on the cabin floor without it It is for the interest of the master that the servant should not suffer in health from starvation and it is also for his interest that he should not become gross from over feeding In the estimation of the owner a slave is the most serviceable when in rather a lean and lank condition such a condition as the race horse is in when fitted for the course and in that condition they are generally to be found on the sugar and cotton plantations along Red River My cabin was within a few rods of the bayou bank and necessity being indeed the mother of invention I resolved upon a mode of obtaining the requisite amount of food without the trouble of resorting nightly to the woods This was to construct a fish trap Having in my mind conceived the manner in which it could be done the next Sunday I set about putting it into practical execution It may be impossible for me to convey to the reader a full and correct idea of its construction but the following will serve as a general description A frame between two and three feet square is made and of a greater or less height according to the depth of water Boards or slats are nailed on three sides of this frame not so closely however as to prevent the water circulating freely through it A door is fitted into the fourth side in such manner that it will slide easily up and down in the grooves cut in the two posts A movable bottom is then so fitted that it can be raised to the top of the frame without difficulty In the centre of the movable bottom an auger hole is bored and into this one end of a handle or round stick is fastened on the under side so loosely that it will turn The handle ascends from the centre of the movable bottom to the top of the frame or as much higher as is desirable Up and down this handle in a great many places are gimlet holes through which small sticks are inserted extending to opposite sides of the frame So many of these small sticks are running out from the handle in all directions that a fish of any considerable dimensions cannot pass through without hitting one of them The frame is then placed in the water and made stationary The trap is set by sliding or drawing up the door and kept in that position by another stick one end of which rests in a notch on the inner side the other end in a notch made in the handle running up from the centre of the movable bottom The trap is baited by rolling a handful of wet meal and cotton together until it becomes hard and depositing it in the back part of the frame A fish swimming through the upraised door towards the bait necessarily strikes one of the small sticks turning the handle which displacing the stick supporting the door the latter falls securing the fish within the frame Taking hold of the top of the handle the movable bottom is then drawn up to the surface of the water and the fish taken out There may have been other such traps in use before mine was constructed but if there were I had never happened to see one Bayou Boeuf abounds in fish of large size and excellent quality and after this time I w as very rarely in want of one for myself or for my comrades Thus a mine was opened a new resource was developed hitherto unthought of by the enslaved children of Africa who toil and hunger along the shores of that sluggish but prolific stream About the time of which I am now writing an event occurred in our immediate neighborhood which made a deep impression upon me and which shows the state of society existing there and the manner in which affronts are oftentimes avenged Directly opposite our quarters on the other side of the bayou was situated the plantation of Mr Marshall He belonged to a family among the most wealthy and aristocratic in the country A gentleman from the vicinity of Natchez had been negotiating with him for the purchase of the estate One day a messenger came in great haste to our plantation saying that a bloody and fearful battle was going on at Marshall's that blood had been spilled and unless the combatants were forthwith separated the result would be disastrous On repairing to Marshall's house a scene presented itself that beggars description On the floor of one of the rooms lay the ghastly corpse of the man from Natchez while Marshall enraged and covered with wounds and blood was stalking back and forth breathing out threatenings and slaughter A difficulty had arisen in the course of their negotiation high words ensued when drawing their weapons the deadly strife began that ended so unfortunately Marshall was never placed in confinement A sort of trial or investigation was had at Marksville when he was acquitted and returned to his plantation rather more respected as I thought than ever from the fact that the blood of a fellow being was on his soul Epps interested himself in his behalf accompanying him to Marksville and on all occasions loudly justifying him but his services in this respect did not afterwards deter a kinsman of this same Marshall from seeking his life also A brawl occurred between them over a gambling table which terminated in a deadly feud Riding up on horseback in front of the house one day armed with pistols and bowie knife Marshall challenged him to come forth and make a final settlement of the quarrel or he would brand him as a coward and shoot him like a dog the first opportunity Not through cowardice nor from any conscientious scruples in my opinion but through the influence of his wife he was restrained from accepting the challenge of his enemy A reconciliation however was effected afterward since which time they have been on terms of the closest intimacy Such occurrences which would bring upon the parties concerned in them merited and condign punishment in the Northern States are frequent on the bayou and pass without notice and almost without comment Every man carries his bowie knife and when two fall out they set to work hacking and thrusting at each other more like savages than civilized and enlightened beings The existence of Slavery in its most cruel form among them has a tendency to brutalize the humane and finer feelings of their nature Daily witnesses of human suffering listening to the agonizing screeches of the slave beholding him writhing beneath the merciless lash bitten and torn by dogs dying without attention and buried without shroud or coffin it cannot otherwise be expected than that they should become brutified and reckless of human life It is true there are many kind hearted and good men in the parish of Avoyelles such men as William Ford who can look with pity upon the sufferings of a slave just as there are over all the world sensitive and sympathetic spirits who cannot look with indifference upon the sufferings of any creature which the Almighty has endowed with life It is not the fault of the slaveholder that he is cruel so much as it is the fault of the system under which he lives He cannot withstand the influence of habit and associations that surround him Taught from earliest childhood by all that he sees and hears that the rod is for the slave's back he will not be apt to change his opinions in maturer years There may be humane masters as there certainly are inhuman ones there may be slaves well clothed well fed and happy as there surely are those half clad half starved and miserable nevertheless the institution that tolerates such wrong and inhumanity as I have witnessed is a cruel unjust and barbarous one Men may write fictions portraying lowly life as it is or as it is not may expatiate with owlish gravity upon the bliss of ignorance discourse flippantly from arm chairs of the pleasures of slave life but let them toil with him in the field sleep with him in the cabin feed with him on husks let them behold him scourged hunted trampled on and they will come back with another story in their mouths Let them know the heart of the poor slave learn his secret thoughts thoughts he dare not utter in the hearing of the white man let them sit by him in the silent watches of the night converse with him in trustful confidence of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and they will find that ninety nine out of every hundred are intelligent enough to understand their situation and to cherish in their bosoms the love of freedom as passionately as themselves XV LABORS ON SUGAR PLANTATIONS THE MODE OF PLANTING CANE OF HOEING CANE CANE RICKS CUTTING CANE DESCRIPTION OF THE CANE KNIFE WINROWING PREPARING FOR SUCCEEDING CROPS DESCRIPTION OF HAWKINS' SUGAR MILL ON BAYOU BOEUF THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS THE CARNIVAL SEASON OF THE CHILDREN OF BONDAGE THE CHRISTMAS SUPPER RED THE FAVORITE COLOR THE VIOLIN AND THE CONSOLATION IT AFFORDED THE CHRISTMAS DANCE LIVELY THE COQUETTE SAM ROBERTS AND HIS RIVALS SLAVE SONGS SOUTHERN LIFE AS IT IS THREE DAYS IN THE YEAR THE SYSTEM OF MARRIAGE UNCLE ABRAM'S CONTEMPT OF MATRIMONY IN consequence of my inability in cotton picking Epps was in the habit of hiring me out on sugar plantations during the season of cane cutting and sugar making He received for my services a dollar a day with the money supplying my place on his cotton plantation Cutting cane was an employment that suited me and for three successive years I held the lead row at Hawkins' leading a gang of from fifty to an hundred hands In a previous the mode of cultivating cotton is described This may be the proper place to speak of the manner of cultivating cane The ground is prepared in beds the same as it is prepared for the reception of the cotton seed except it is ploughed deeper Drills are made in the same manner Planting commences in January and continues until April It is necessary to plant a sugar field only once in three years Three crops are taken before the seed or plant is exhausted Three gangs are employed in the operation One draws the cane from the rick or stack cutting the top and flags from the stalk leaving only that part which is sound and healthy Each joint of the cane has an eye like the eye of a potato which sends forth a sprout when buried in the soil Another gang lays the cane in the drill placing two stalks side by side in such manner that joints will occur once in four or six inches The third gang follows with hoes drawing earth upon the stalks and covering them to the depth of three inches In four weeks at the farthest the sprouts appear above the ground and from this time forward grow with great rapidity A sugar field is hoed three times the same as cotton save that a greater quantity of earth is drawn to the roots By the first of August hoeing is usually over About the middle of September whatever is required for seed is cut and tacked in ricks as they are termed In October it is ready for the mill or sugar house and then the general cutting begins The blade of a cane knife is fifteen inches long three inches wide in the middle and tapering towards the point and handle The blade is thin and in order to be at all serviceable must be kept very sharp Every third hand takes the lead of two others one of whom is on each side of him The lead hand in the first place with a blow of his knife shears the flags from the stalk He next cuts off the top down as far as it is green He must be careful to sever all the green from the ripe part inasmuch as the juice of the former sours the molasses and renders it unsalable Then he severs the stalk at the root and lays it directly behind him His right and left hand companions lay their stalks when cut in the same manner upon his To every three hands there is a cart which follows and the stalks are thrown into it by the younger slaves when it is drawn to the sugar house and ground If the planter apprehends a frost the cane is winrowed Winrowing is the cutting the stalks at an early period and throwing them lengthwise in the water furrow in such a manner that the tops will cover the butts of the stalks They will remain in this condition three weeks or a month without souring and secure from frost When the proper time arrives they are taken up trimmed and carted to the sugarhouse In the month of January the slaves enter the field again to prepare for another crop The ground is now strewn with the tops and flags cut from the past year's cane On a dry day fire is set to this combustible refuse which sweeps over the field leaving it bare and clean and ready for the hoes The earth is loosened about the roots of the old stubble and in process of time another crop springs up from the last year's seed It is the same the year following but the third year the seed has exhausted its strength and the field must be ploughed and planted again The second year the cane is sweeter and yields more than the first and the third year more than the second During the three seasons I labored on Hawkins' plantation I was employed a considerable portion of the time in the sugar house He is celebrated as the producer of the finest variety of white sugar The following is a general description of his sugar house and the process of manufacture The mill is an immense brick building standing on the shore of the bayou Running out from the building is an open shed at least an hundred feet in length and forty or fifty feet in width The boiler in which the steam is generated is situated outside the main building the machinery and engine rest on a brick pier fifteen feet above the floor within the body of the building The machinery turns two great iron rollers between two and three feet in diameter and six or eight feet in length They are elevated above the brick pier and roll in towards each other An endless carrier made of chain and wood like leathern belts used in small mills extends from the iron rollers out of the main building and through the entire length of the open shed The carts in which the cane is brought from the field as fast as it is cut are unloaded at the sides of the shed All along the endless carrier are ranged slave children whose business it is to place the cane upon it when it is conveyed through the shed into the main building where it falls between the rollers is crushed and drops upon another carrier that conveys it out of the main building in an opposite direction depositing it in the top of a chimney upon a fire beneath which consumes it It is necessary to burn it in this manner because otherwise it would soon fill the building and more especially because it would soon sour and engender disease The juice of the cane falls into a conductor underneath the iron rollers and is carried into a reservoir Pipes convey it from thence into five filterers holding several hogsheads each These filterers are filled with bone black a substance resembling pulverized charcoal It is made of bones calcinated in close vessels and is used for the purpose of decolorizing by filtration the cane juice before boiling Through these five filterers it passes in succession and then runs into a large reservoir underneath the ground floor from whence it is carried up by means of a steam pump into a clarifier made of sheet iron where it is heated by steam until it boils From the first clarifier it is carried in pipes to a second and a third and thence into close iron pans through which tubes pass filled with steam While in a boiling state it flows through three pans in succession and is then carried in other pipes down to the coolers on the ground floor Coolers are wooden boxes with sieve bottoms made of the finest wire As soon as the syrup passes into the coolers and is met by the air it grains and the molasses at once escapes through the sieves into a cistern It is then white or loaf sugar of the finest kind clear clean and as white as snow When cool it is taken out packed in hogsheads and is ready for market The molasses is then carried from the cistern into the upper story again and by another process converted into brown sugar There are larger mills and those constructed differently from the one thus imperfectly described but none perhaps more celebrated than this anywhere on Bayou Boeuf Lambert of New Orleans is a partner of Hawkins He is a man of vast wealth holding as I have been told an interest in over forty different sugar plantations in Louisiana The only respite from constant labor the slave has through the whole year is during the Christmas holidays Epps allowed us three others allow four five and six days according to the measure of their generosity It is the only time to which they look forward with any interest or pleasure They are glad when night comes not only because it brings them a few hours repose but because it brings them one day nearer Christmas It is hailed with equal delight by the old and the young even Uncle Abram ceases to glorify Andrew Jackson and Patsey forgets her many sorrows amid the general hilarity of the holidays It is the time of feasting and frolicking and fiddling the carnival season with the children of bondage They are the only days when they are allowed a little restricted liberty and heartily indeed do they enjoy it It is the custom for one planter to give a Christmas supper inviting the shaves from neighboring plantations to join his own on the occasion for instance one year it is given by Epps the next by Marshall the next by Hawkins and so on Usually from three to five hundred are assembled coming together on foot in carts on horseback on mules riding double and triple sometimes a boy and girl at others a girl and two boys and at others again a boy a girl and an old woman Uncle Abram astride a mule with Aunt Phebe and Patsey behind him trotting towards a Christmas supper would be no uncommon sight on Bayou Boeuf Then too of all days i' the year they array themselves in their best attire The cotton coat has been washed clean the stump of a tallow candle has been applied to the shoes and if so fortunate as to possess a rimless or a crownless hat it is placed jauntily on the head They are welcomed with equal cordiality however if they come bare headed and bare footed to the feast As a general thing the women wear handkerchiefs tied about their heads but if chance has thrown in their way a fiery red ribbon or a cast off bonnet of their mistress' grandmother it is sure to be worn on such occasions Red the deep blood red is decidedly the favorite color among the enslaved damsels of my acquaintance If a red ribbon does not encircle the neck you will be certain to find all the hair of their woolly heads tied up with red strings of one sort or another The table is spread in the open air and loaded with varieties of meat and piles of vegetables Bacon and corn meal at such times are dispensed with Sometimes the cooking is performed in the kitchen on the plantation at others in the shade of wide branching trees In the latter case a ditch is dug in the ground and wood laid in and burned until it is filled with glowing coals over which chickens ducks turkeys pigs and not unfrequently the entire body of a wild ox are roasted They are furnished also with flour of which biscuits are made and often with peach and other preserves with tarts and every manner and description of pies except the mince that being an article of pastry as yet unknown among them Only the slave who has lived all the years on his scanty allowance of meal and bacon can appreciate such suppers White people in great numbers assemble to witness the gastronomical enjoyments They seat themselves at the rustic table the males on one side the females on the other The two between whom there may have been an exchange of tenderness invariably manage to sit opposite for the omnipresent Cupid disdains not to hurl his arrows into the simple hearts of slaves Unalloyed and exulting happiness lights up the dark faces of them all The ivory teeth contrasting with their black complexions exhibit two long white streaks the whole extent of the table All round the bountiful board a multitude of eyes roll in ecstacy Giggling and laughter and the clattering of cutlery and crockery succeed Cuffee's elbow hunches his neighbor's side impelled by an involuntary impulse of delight Nelly shakes her finger at Sambo and laughs she knows not why and so the fun and merriment flows on When the viands have disappeared and the hungry maws of the children of toil are satisfied then next in the order of amusement is the Christmas dance My business on these gala days always was to play on the violin The African race is a music loving one proverbially and many there were among my fellow bondsmen whose organs of tune were strikingly developed and who could thumb the banjo with dexterity but at the expense of appearing egotistical I must nevertheless declare that I was considered the Ole Bull of Bayou Boeuf My master often received letters sometimes from a distance of ten miles requesting him to send me to play at a ball or festival of the whites He received his compensation and usually I also returned with many picayunes jingling in my pockets the extra contributions of those to whose delight I had administered In this manner I became more acquainted than I otherwise would up and down the bayou The young men and maidens of Holmesville always knew there was to be a jollification somewhere whenever Platt Epps was seen passing through the town with his fiddle in his hand Where are you going now Platt and What is coming off tonight Platt would be interrogatories issuing from every door and window and many a time when there was no special hurry yielding to pressing importunities Platt would draw his bow and sitting astride his mule perhaps discourse musically to a crowd of delighted children gathered around him in the street Alas had it not been for my beloved violin I scarcely can conceive how I could have endured the long years of bondage It introduced me to great houses relieved me of many days' labor in the field supplied me with conveniences for my cabin with pipes and tobacco and extra pairs of shoes and oftentimes led me away from the presence of a hard master to witness scenes of jollity and mirth It was my companion the friend of my bosom triumphing loudly when I was joyful and uttering its soft melodious consolations when I was sad Often at midnight when sleep had fled affrighted from the cabin and my soul was disturbed and troubled with the contemplation of my fate it would sing me a song of peace On holy Sabbath days when an hour or two of leisure was allowed it would accompany me to some quiet place on the bayou bank and lifting up its voice discourse kindly and pleasantly indeed It heralded my name round the country made me friends who otherwise would not have noticed me gave me an honored seat at the yearly feasts and secured the loudest and heartiest welcome of them all at the Christmas dance The Christmas dance Oh ye pleasure seeking sons and daughters of idleness who move with measured step listless and snail like through the slow winding cotillon if ye wish to look upon the celerity if not the poetry of motion upon genuine happiness rampant and unrestrained go down to Louisiana and see the slaves dancing in the starlight of a Christmas night On that particular Christmas I have now in my mind a description whereof will serve as a description of the day generally Miss Lively and Mr Sam the first belonging to Stewart the latter to Roberts started the ball It was well known that Sam cherished an ardent passion for Lively as also did one of Marshall's and another of Carey's boys for Lively was lively indeed and a heart breaking coquette withal It was a victory for Sam Roberts when rising from the repast she gave him her hand for the first figure in preference to either of his rivals They were somewhat crest fallen and shaking their heads angrily rather intimated they would like to pitch into Mr Sam and hurt him badly But not an emotion of wrath ruffled the placid bosom of Samuel as his legs flew like drum sticks down the outside and up the middle by the side of his bewitching partner The whole company cheered them vociferously and excited with the applause they continued tearing down after all the others had become exhausted and halted a moment to recover breath But Sam's superhuman exertions overcame him finally leaving Lively alone yet whirling like a top Thereupon one of Sam's rivals Pete Marshall dashed in and with might and main leaped and shuffled and threw himself into every conceivable shape as if determined to show Miss Lively and all the world that Sam Roberts was of no account Pete's affection however was greater than his discretion Such violent exercise took the breath out of him directly and he dropped like an empty bag Then was the time for Harry Carey to try his hand but Lively also soon out winded him amidst hurrahs and shouts fully sustaining her well earned reputation of being the fastest gal on the bayou One set off another takes its place he or she remaining longest on the floor receiving the most uproarious commendation and so the dancing continues until broad daylight It does not cease with the sound of the fiddle but in that case they set up a music peculiar to themselves This is called patting accompanied with one of those unmeaning songs composed rather for its adaptation to a certain tune or measure than for the purpose of expressing any distinct idea The patting is performed by striking the hands on the knees then striking the hands together then striking the right shoulder with one hand the left with the other all the while keeping time with the feet and singing perhaps this song Harper's creek and roarin' ribber Thar my dear we'll live forebber Den we'll go to de Ingin nation All I walls in dis creation Is pretty little wife and big plantation Chorus Up dat oak and down dat ribber Two overseers and one little nigger Or if these

Hop Jim along Walk Jim along Talk Jim along c Old black Dan as black as tar He dam glad he was not dar Hop Jim along c During the remaining holidays succeeding Christmas they are provided with passes and permitted to go where they please within a limited distance or they may remain and labor on the plantation in which case they are paid for it It is very rarely however that the latter alternative is accepted They may be seen at these times hurrying in all directions as happy looking mortals as can be found on the face of the earth They are different beings from what they are in the field the temporary relaxation the brief deliverance from fear and from the lash producing an entire metamorphosis in their appearance and demeanor In visiting riding renewing old friendships or perchance reviving some old attachment or pursuing whatever pleasure may suggest itself the time is occupied Such is southern life as it is three days in the year as I found it the other three hundred and sixty two being days of weariness and fear and suffering and unremitting labor Marriage is frequently contracted during the holidays if such an institution may be said to exist among them The only ceremony required before entering into that holy estate is to obtain the consent of the respective owners It is usually encouraged by the masters of female slaves Either party can have as many husbands or wives as the owner will permit and either is at liberty to discard the other at pleasure The law in relation to divorce or to bigamy and so forth is not applicable to property of course If the wife does not belong on the same plantation with the husband the latter is permitted to visit her on Saturday nights if the distance is not too far Uncle Abram's wife lived seven miles from Epps' on Bayou Huff Power He had permission to visit her once a fortnight but he was growing old as has been said and truth to say had latterly well nigh forgotten her Uncle Abram had no time to spare from his meditations on General Jackson connubial dalliance being well enough for the young and thoughtless but unbecoming a grave and solemn philosopher like himself XVI OVERSEERS HOW THEY ARE ARMED AND ACCOMPANIED THE HOMICIDE HIS EXECUTION AT MARKSVILLE SLAVE DRIVERS APPOINTED DRIVER ON REMOVING TO BAYOU BOEUFF PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT EPPS'S ATTEMPT TO CUT PLATT'S THROAT THE ESCAPE FROM HIM PROTECTED BY THE MISTRESS FORBIDS READING AND WRITING OBTAIN A SHEET OF PAPER AFTER NINE YEARS' EFFORT THE LETTER ARMSBY THE MEAN WHITE PARTIALLY CONFIDE IN HIM HIS TREACHERY EPPS' SUSPICIONS HOW THEY WERE QUIETED BURNING THE LETTER ARMSBY LEAVES THE BAYOU DISAPPOINTMENT AND DESPAIR WITH the exception of my trip to St Mary's parish and my absence during the cane cutting seasons I was constantly employed on the plantation of Master Epps He was considered but a small planter not having a sufficient number of hands to require the services of an overseer acting in the latter capacity himself Not able to increase his force it was his custom to hire during the hurry of cotton picking On larger estates employing fifty or a hundred or perhaps two hundred hands an overseer is deemed indispensable These gentlemen ride into the field on horseback without an exception to my knowledge armed with pistols bowie knife whip and accompanied by several dogs They follow equipped in this fashion in rear of the slaves keeping a sharp lookout upon them all The requisite qualifications in an overseer are utter heartlessness brutality and cruelty It is his business to produce large crops and if that is accomplished no matter what amount of suffering it may have cost The presence of the dogs are necessary to overhaul a fugitive who may take to his heels as is sometimes the case when faint or sick he is unable to maintin his row and unable also to endure the whip The pistols are reserved for any dangerous emergency there having been instances when such weapons were necessary Goaded into uncontrollable madness even the slave will sometimes turn upon his oppressor The gallows were standing at Marksville last January upon which one was executed a year ago for killing his overseer It occurred not many miles from Epps' plantation on Red River The slave was given his task at splitting rails In the course of the day the overseer sent him on an errand which occupied so much time that it was not possible for him to perform the task The next day he was called to an account but the loss of time occasioned by the errand was no excuse and he was ordered to kneel and bare his back for the reception of the lash They were in the woods alone beyond the reach of sight or hearing The boy submitted until maddened at such injustice and insane with pain he sprang to his feet and seizing an axe literally chopped the overseer in pieces He made no attempt whatever at concealment but hastening to his master related the whole affair and declared himself ready to expiate the wrong by the sacrifice of his life He was led to the scaffold and while the rope was around his neck maintained an undismayed and fearless bearing and with his last words justified the act Besides the overseer there are drivers under him the number being in proportion to the number of hands in the field The drivers are black who in addition to the performance of their equal share of work are compelled to do the whipping of their several gangs Whips hang around their necks and if they fail to use them thoroughly are whipped themselves They have a few privileges however for example in cane cutting the hands are not allowed to sit down long enough to eat their dinners Carts filled with corn cake cooked at the kitchen are driven into the field at noon The cake is distributed by the drivers and must be eaten with the least possible delay When the slave ceases to perspire as he often does when taxed beyond his strength he falls to the ground and becomes entirely helpless It is then the duty of the driver to drag him into the shade of the standing cotton or cane or of a neighboring tree where he dashes buckets of water upon him and uses other means of bringing out perspiration again when he is ordered to his place and compelled to continue his labor At Huff Power when I first came to Epps' Tom one of Roberts' negroes was driver He was a burly fellow and severe in the extreme After Epps' removal to Bayou Boeuf that distinguished honor was conferred upon myself Up to the time of my departure I had to wear a whip about my neck in the field If Epps was present I dared not show any lenity not having the Christian fortitude of a certain well known Uncle Tom sufficiently to brave his wrath by refusing to perform the office In that way only I escaped the immediate martyrdom he suffered and withal saved my companions much suffering as it proved in the end Epps I soon found whether actually in the field or not had his eyes pretty generally upon us From the piazza from behind some adjacent tree or other concealed point of observation he was perpetually on the watch If one of us had been backward or idle through the day we were apt to be told all about it on returning to the quarters and as it was a matter of principle with him to reprove every offence of that kind that came within his knowledge the offender not only was certain of receiving a castigation for his tardiness but I likewise was punished for permitting it If on the other hand he had seen me use the lash freely the man was satisfied Practice makes perfect truly and during my eight years' experience as a driver I learned to handle the whip with marvelous dexterity and precision throwing the lash within a hair's breadth of the back the ear the nose without however touching either of them If Epps was observed at a distance or we had reason to apprehend he was as sneaking somewhere in the vicinity I would commence plying the lash vigorously when according to arrangement they would squirm and screech as if in agony although not one of them had in fact been even grazed Patsey would take occasion if he made his appearance presently to mumble in his hearing some complaints that Platt was lashing them the whole time and Uncle Abram with an appearance of honesty peculiar to himself would declare roundly I had just whipped them worse than General Jackson whipped the enemy at New Orleans If Epps was not drunk and in one of his beastly humors this was in general satisfactory If he was some one or more of us must suffer as a matter of course Sometimes his violence assumed a dangerous form placing the lives of his human stock in jeopardy On one occasion the drunken madman thought to amuse himself by cutting my throat He had been absent at Holmesville in attendance at a shooting match and none of us were aware of his return While hoeing by the side of Patsey she exclaimed in a low voice suddenly Platt d'ye see old Hog Jaw beckoning me to come to him Glancing sideways I discovered him in the edge of the field motioning and grimacing as was his habit when half intoxicated Aware of his lewd intentions Patsey began to cry I whispered her not to look up and to continue at her work as if she had not observed him Suspecting the truth of the matter however he soon staggered up to me in a great rage What did you say to Pats he demanded with an oath I made him some evasive answer which only had the effect of increasing his violence How long have you owned this plantation say you d d nigger he inquired with a malicious sneer at the same time taking hold of my shirt collar with one hand and thrusting the other into his pocket Now I'll cut your black throat that's what I'll do drawing his knife from his pocket as he said it But with one hand he was unable to open it until finally seizing the blade in his teeth I saw he was about to succeed and felt the necessity of escaping from him for in his present reckless state it was evident he was not joking by any means My shirt was open in front and as I turned round quickly and sprang from him while he still retained his gripe it was stripped entirely from my back There was no difficulty now in eluding him He would chase me until out of breath then stop until it was recovered swear and renew the chase again Now he would command me to come to him now endeavor to coax me but I was careful to keep at a respectful distance In this manner we made the circuit of the field several times he making desperate plunges and I always dodging them more amused than frightened well knowing that when his sober senses returned he would laugh at his own drunken folly At length I observed the mistress standing by the yard fence watching our half serious half comical manoeuvres Shooting past him I ran directly to her Epps on discovering her did not follow He remained about the field an hour or more during which time I stood by the mistress having related the particulars of what had taken place Now she was aroused again denouncing her husband and Patsey about equally Finally Epps came towards the house by this time nearly sober walking demurely with his hands behind his back and attempting to look as innocent as a child As he approached nevertheless Mistress Epps began to berate him roundly heaping upon him many rather disrespectful epithets and demanding for what reason he had attempted to cut my throat Epps made wondrous strange of it all and to my surprise swore by all the saints in the calendar he had not spoken to me that day Platt you lying nigger have I was his brazen appeal to me It is not safe to contradict a master even by the assertion of a truth So I was silent and when he entered the house I returned to the field and the affair was never after alluded to Shortly after this time a circumstance occurred that came nigh divulging the secret of my real name and history which I had so long and carefully concealed and upon which I was convinced depended my final escape Soon after he purchased me Epps asked me if I could write and read and on being informed that I had received some instruction in those branches of education he assured me with emphasis if he ever caught me with a book or with pen and ink he would give me a hundred lashes He said he wanted me to understand that he bought niggers to work and not to educate He never inquired a word of my past life or from whence I came The mistress however cross examined me frequently about Washington which she supposed was my native city and more than once remarked that I did not talk nor act like the other niggers and she was sure I had seen more of the world than I admitted My great object always was to invent means of getting a letter secretly into the post office directed to some of my friends or family at the North The difficulty of such an achievement cannot be comprehended by one unacquainted with the severe restrictions imposed upon me In the first place I was deprived of pen ink and paper In the second place a slave cannot leave his plantation without a pass nor will a post master mail a letter for one without written instructions from his owner I was in slavery nine years and always watchful and on the alert before I met with the good fortune of obtaining a sheet of paper While Epps was in New Orleans one winter disposing of his cotton the mistress sent me to Holmesville with an order for several articles and among the rest a quantity of foolscap I appropriated a sheet concealing it in the cabin under the board on which I slept After various experiments I succeeded in making ink by boiling white maple bark and with a feather plucked from the wing of a duck manufactured a pen When all were asleep in the cabin by the light of the coals lying upon my plank couch I managed to complete a somewhat lengthy epistle It was directed to an old acquaintance at Sandy Hill stating my condition and urging him to take measures to restore me to liberty This letter I kept a long time contriving measures by which it could be safely deposited in the post office At length a low fellow by the name of Armsby hitherto a stranger came into the neighborhood seeking a situation as overseer He applied to Epps and was about the plantation for several days He next went over to Shaw's near by and remained with him several weeks Shaw was generally surrounded by such worthless characters being himself noted as a gambler and unprincipled man He had made a wife of his slave Charlotte and a brood of young mulattoes were growing up in his house Armsby became so much reduced at last that he was compelled to labor with the slaves A white man working in the field is a rare and unusual spectacle on Bayou Boeuf I improved every opportunity of cultivating his acquaintance privately desiring to obtain his confidence so far as to be willing to intrust the letter to his keeping He visited Marksville repeatedly he informed me a town some twenty miles distant and there I proposed to myself the letter should be mailed Carefully deliberating on the most proper manner of approaching him on the subject I concluded finally to ask him simply if he would deposit a letter for me in the Marksville post office the next time he visited that place without disclosing to him that the letter was written or any of the particulars it contained for I had fears that he might betray me and knew that some inducement must be held out to him of a pecuniary nature before it would be safe to confide in him As late as one o'clock one night I stole noiselessly from my cabin and crossing the field to Shaw's found him sleeping on the piazza I had but a few picayunes the proceeds of my fiddling performances but all I had in the world I promised him if he would do me the favor required I begged him not to expose me if he could not grant the request He assured me upon his honor he would deposit it in the Marksville post office and that he would keep it an inviolable secret forever Though the letter was in my pocket at the time I dared not then deliver it to him but stating I would have it written in a day or two bade him good night and returned to my cabin It was impossible for me to expel the suspicions I entertained and all night I lay awake revolving in my mind the safest course to pursue I was willing to risk a great deal to accomplish my purpose but should the letter by any means fall into the hands of Epps it would be a death blow to my aspirations I was perplexed in the extreme My suspicions were well founded as the sequel demonstrated The next day but one while scraping cotton in the field Epps seated himself on the line fence between Shaw's plantation and his own in such a position as to overlook the scene of our labors Presently Armsby made his appearance and mounting the fence took a seat beside him They remained two or three hours all of which time I was in an agony of apprehension That night while broiling my bacon Epps entered the cabin with his rawhide in his hand Well boy said he I understand I've got a larned nigger that writes letters and tries to get white fellows to mail 'em Wonder if you know who he is My worst fears were realized and although it may not be considered entirely creditable even under the circumstances yet a resort to duplicity and downright falsehood was the only refuge that presented itself Don't know nothing about it Master Epps I answered him assuming an air of ignorance and surprise Don't know nothing at all about it sir Wan't you over to Shaw's night before last he inquired No master was the reply Hav'nt you asked that fellow Armsby to mail a letter for you at Marksville Why Lord master I never spoke three words to him in all my life I don't know what you mean Well he continued Armsby told me to day the devil was among my niggers that I had one that needed close watching or he would run away and when I axed him why he said you come over to Shaw's and waked him up in the night and wanted him to carry a letter to Marksville What have you got to say to that ha All I've got to say master I replied is there is no truth in it How could I write a letter without any ink or paper There is nobody I want to write to 'cause I haint got no friends living as I know of That Armsby is a lying drunken fellow they say and nobody believes him anyway You know I always tell the truth and that I never go off the plantation without a pass Now master I can see what that Armsby is after plain enough Did'nt he want you to hire him for an overseer Yes he wanted me to hire him answered Epps That's it said I he wants to make you believe we're all going to run away and then he thinks you'll hire an overseer to watch us He just made that story out of whole cloth 'cause he wants to get a situation It's all a lie master you may depend on't Epps mused awhile evidently impressed with the plausibility of my theory and exclaimed I'm d d Platt if I don't believe you tell the truth He must take me for a soft to think he can come it over me with them kind of yarns musn't he Maybe he thinks he can fool me maybe he thinks I don't know nothing can't take care of my own niggers eh Soft soap old Epps eh Ha ha ha D n Armsby Set the dogs on him Platt and with many other comments descriptive of Armsby's general character and his capability of taking care of his own business and attending to his own niggers Master Epps left the cabin As soon as he was gone I threw the letter in the fire and with a desponding and despairing heart beheld the epistle which had cost me so much anxiety and thought and which I fondly hoped would have been my forerunner to the land of freedom writhe and shrivel on its bed of coals and dissolve into smoke and ashes Armsby the treacherous wretch was driven from Shaw's plantation not long subsequently much to my relief for I feared he might renew his conversation and perhaps induce Epps to credit him I knew not now whither to look for deliverance Hopes sprang up in my heart only to be crushed and blighted The summer of my life was passing away I felt I was growing prematurely old that a few years more and toil and grief and the poisonous miasma of the swamps would accomplish their work on me would consign me to the grave's embrace to moulder and be forgotten Repelled betrayed cut off from the hope of succor I could only prostrate myself upon the earth and groan in unutterable anguish The hope of rescue was the only light that cast a ray of comfort on my heart That was now flickering faint and low another breath of disappointment would extinguish it altogether leaving me to grope in midnight darkness to the end of life XVII WILEY DISREGARDS THE COUNSELS OF AUNT PHEBE AND UNCLE ABRAM AND IS CAUGHT BY THE PATROLLERS THE ORGANIZATION AND DUTIES OF THE LATTER WILEY RUNS AWAY SPECULATIONS IN REGARD TO HIM HIS UNEXPECTED RETURN HIS CAPTURE ON THE RED RIVER AND CONFINEMENT IN ALEXANDRIA JAIL DISCOVERED BY JOSEPH B ROBERTS SUBDUING DOGS IN ANTICIPATION OF ESCAPE THE FUGITIVES IN THE GREAT PINE WOODS CAPTURED BY ADAM TAYDEM AND THE INDIANS AUGUSTUS KILLED BY DOGS NELLY ELDRET'S SLAVE WOMAN THE STORY OF CELESTE THE CONCERTED MOVEMENT LEW CHENEY THE TRAITOR THE IDEA OF INSURRECTION THE year down to which time I have now arrived omitting many occurrences uninteresting to the reader was an unlucky year for my companion Wiley the husband of Phebe whose taciturn and retiring nature has thus far kept him in the background Notwithstanding Wiley seldom opened his mouth and revolved in his obscure and unpretending orbit without a grumble nevertheless the warm elements of sociality were strong in the bosom of that silent nigger In the exuberance of his self reliance disregarding the philosophy of Uncle Abram and setting the counsels of Aunt Phebe utterly at naught he had the fool hardiness to essay a nocturnal visit to a neighboring cabin without a pass So attractive was the society in which he found himself that Wiley took little note of the passing hours and the light began to break in the east before he was aware Speeding homeward as fast as he could run he hoped to reach the quarters before the horn would sound but unhappily he was spied on the way by a company of patrollers How it is in other dark places of slavery I do not know but on Bayou Boeuf there is an organization of patrollers as they are styled whose business it is to seize and whip any slave they may find wandering from the plantation They ride on horseback headed by a captain armed and accompanied by dogs They have the right either by law or by general consent to inflict discretionary chastisement upon a black man caught beyond the boundaries of his master's estate without a pass and even to shoot him if he attempts to escape Each company has a certain distance to ride up and down the bayou They are compensated by the planters who contribute in proportion to the number of slaves they own The clatter of their horses' hoofs dashing by can be heard at all hours of the light and frequently they may be seen driving a slave before them or leading him by a rope fastened around his neck to his owner's plantation Wiley fled before one of these companies thinking he could reach his cabin before they could overtake him but one of their dogs a great ravenous hound griped him by the leg and held him fast The patrollers whipped him severely and brought him a prisoner to Epps From him he received another flagellation still more severe so that the cuts of the lash and the bites of the dog rendered him sore stiff and miserable insomuch he was scarcely able to move It was impossible in such a state to keep up his row and consequently there was not an hour in the day but Wiley felt the sting of his master's rawhide on his raw and bleeding back His sufferings became intolerable and finally he resolved to run away Without disclosing his intentions to run away even to his wife Phebe he proceeded to make arrangements for carrying his plan into execution Having cooked his whole week's allowance he cautiously left the cabin on a Sunday night after the inmates of the quarters were asleep When the horn sounded in the morning Wiley did not make his appearance Search was made for him in the cabins in the corn crib in the cotton house and in every nook and corner of the premises Each of us was examined touching any knowledge we might have that could throw light upon his sudden disappearance or present whereabouts Epps raved and stormed and mounting his horse galloped to neighboring plantations making in inquiries in all directions The search was fruitless Nothing whatever was elicited going to show what had become of the missing man The dogs were led to the swamp but were unable to strike his trail They would circle away through the forest their noses to the ground but invariably returned in a short time to the spot from whence they started Wiley had escaped and so secretly and cautiously as to elude and baffle all pursuit Days and even weeks passed away and nothing could be heard of him Epps did nothing but curse and swear It was the only topic of conversation among us when alone We indulged in a great deal of speculation in regard to him one suggesting he might have been drowned in some bayou inasmuch as he was a poor swimmer another that perhaps he might have been devoured by alligators or stung by the venomous moccasin whose bite is certain and sudden death The warm and hearty sympathies of us all however were with poor Wiley wherever he might be Many an earnest prayer ascended from the lips of Uncle Abram beseeching safety for the wanderer In about three weeks when all hope of ever seeing him again was dismissed to our surprise he one day appeared among us On leaving the plantation he informed us it was his intention to make his way back to South Carolina to the old quarters of Master Buford During the day he remained secreted sometimes in the branches of a tree and at night pressed forward through the swamps Finally one morning just at dawn he reached the shore of Red River While standing on the bank considering how he could cross it a white man accosted him and demanded a pass Without one and evidently a runaway he was taken to Alexandria the shire town of the parish of Rapides and confined in prison It happened several days after that Joseph B Roberts uncle of Mistress Epps was in Alexandria and going into the jail recognized him Wiley had worked on his plantation when Epps resided at Huff Power Paying the jail fee and writing him a pass underneath which was a note to Epps requesting him not to whip him on his return Wiley was sent back to Bayou Boeuf It was the hope that hung upon this request and which Roberts assured him would be respected by his master that sustained him as he approached the house The request however as may be readily supposed was entirely disregarded After being kept in suspense three days Wiley was stripped and compelled to endure one of those inhuman floggings to which the poor slave is so often subjected It was the first and last attempt of Wiley to run away The long scars upon his back which he will carry with him to the grave perpetually remind him of the dangers of such a step There was not a day throughout the ten years I belonged to Epps that I did not consult with myself upon the prospect of escape I laid many plans which at the time I considered excellent ones but one after the other they were all abandoned No man who has never been placed in such a situation can comprehend the thousand obstacles thrown in the way of the flying slave Every white man's hand is raised against him the patrollers are watching for him the hounds are ready to follow on his track and the nature of the country is such as renders it impossible to pass through it with any safety I thought however that the time might come perhaps when I should be running through the swamps again I concluded in that chase to be prepared for Epps' dogs should they pursue me He possessed several one of which was a notorious slave hunter and the most fierce and savage of his breed While out hunting the coon or the opossum I never allowed an opportunity to escape when alone of whipping them severely In this manner I succeeded at length in subduing them completely They feared me obeying my voice at once when others had no control over them whatever Had they followed and overtaken me I doubt not they would have shrank from attacking me Notwithstanding the certainty of being captured the woods and swamps are nevertheless continually filled with runaways Many of them when sick or so worn out as to be unable to perform their tasks escape into the swamps willing to suffer the punishment inflicted for such offences in order to obtain a day or two of rest While I belonged to Ford I was unwittingly the means of disclosing the hiding place of six or eight who had taken up their residence in the Great Pine Woods Adam Taydem frequently sent me from the mills over to the opening after provisions The whole distance was then a thick pine forest About ten o'clock of a beautiful moonlight night while walking along the Texas road returning to the mills carrying a dressed pig in a bag swung over my shoulder I heard footsteps behind me and turning round beheld two black men in the dress of slaves approaching at a rapid pace When within a short distance one of them raised a club as if intending to strike me the other snatched at the bag I managed to dodge them both and seizing a pine knot hurled it with such force against the head of one of them that he was prostrated apparently senseless to the ground Just then two more made their appearance from one side of the road Before they could grapple me however I succeeded in passing them and taking to my heels fled much affrighted towards the mills When Adam was informed of the adventure he hastened straightway to the Indian village and arousing Cascalla and several of his tribe started in pursuit of the highwaymen I accompanied them to the scene of attack when we discovered a puddle of blood in the road where the man whom I had smitten with the pine knot had fallen After searching carefully through the woods a long time one of Cascalla's men discovered a smoke curling up through the branches of several prostrate pines whose tops had fallen together The rendezvous was cautiously surrounded and all of them taken prisoners They had escaped from a plantation in the vicinity of Lamourie and had been secreted there three weeks They had no evil design upon me except to frighten me out of my pig Having observed me passing towards Ford's just at night fall and suspecting the nature of my errand they had followed me seen me butcher and dress the porker and start on my return They had been pinched for food and were driven to this extremity by necessity Adam conveyed them to the parish jail and was liberally rewarded Not unfrequently the runaway loses his life in the attempt to escape Epps' premises were bounded on one side by Carey's a very extensive sugar plantation He cultivates annually at least fifteen hundred acres of cane manufacturing twenty two or twenty three hundred hogsheads of sugar an hogshead and a half being the usual yield of an acre Besides this he also cultivates five or six hundred acres of corn and cotton He owned last year one hundred and fifty three field hands besides nearly as many children and yearly hires a drove during the busy season from this side the Mississippi One of his negro drivers a pleasant intelligent boy was named Augustus During the holidays and occasionally while at work in adjoining fields I had an opportunity of making his acquaintance which eventually ripened into a warm and mutual attachment Summer before last he was so unfortunate as to incur the displeasure of the overseer a coarse heartless brute who whipped him most cruelly Augustus ran away Reaching a cane rick on Hawkins' plantation he secreted himself in the top of it All Carey's dogs were put upon his track some fifteen of them and soon scented his footsteps to the hiding place They surrounded the rick baying and scratching but could not reach him Presently guided by the clamor of the hounds the pursuers rode up when the overseer mounting on to the rick drew him forth As he rolled down to the ground the whole pack plunged upon him and before they could be beaten off had gnawed and mutilated his body in the most shocking manner their teeth having penetrated to the bone in an hundred places He was taken up tied upon a mule and carried home But this was Augustus' last trouble He lingered until the next day when death sought the unhappy boy and kindly relieved him from his agony It was not unusual for slave women as well as slave men to endeavor to escape Nelly Eldret's girl with whom I lumbered for a time in the Big Cane Brake lay concealed in Epps' corn crib three days At night when his family were asleep she would steal into the quarters for food and return to the crib again We concluded it would no longer be safe for us to allow her to remain and accordingly she retraced her steps to her own cabin But the most remarkable instance of a successful evasion of dogs and hunters was the following Among Carey's girls was one by the name of Celeste She was nineteen or twenty and far whiter than her owner or any of his offspring It required a close inspection to distinguish in her features the slightest trace of African blood A stranger would never have dreamed that she was the descendant of slaves I was sitting in my cabin late at night playing a low air on my violin when the door opened carefully and Celeste stood before me She was pale and haggard Had an apparition arisen from the earth I could not have been more startled Who are you I demanded after gazing at her a moment I'm hungry give me some bacon was her reply My first impression was that she was some deranged young mistress who escaping from home was wandering she knew not whither and had been attracted to my cabin by the sound of the violin The coarse cotton slave dress she wore however soon dispelled such a supposition What is your name I again interrogated My name is Celeste she answered I belong to Carey and have been two days among the palmettoes I am sick and can't work and would rather die in the swamp than be whipped to death by the overseer Carey's dogs won't follow me They have tried to set them on There's a secret between them and Celeste and they wont mind the devilish orders of the overseer Give me some meat I'm starving I divided my scanty allowance with her and while partaking of it she related how she had managed to escape and described the place of her concealment In the edge of the swamp not half a mile from Epps' house was as a large space thousands of acres in extent thickly covered with palmetto Tall trees whose long arms interlocked each other formed a canopy above them so dense as to exclude the beams of the sun It was like twilight always even in the middle of the brightest day In the centre of this great space which nothing but serpents very often explore a sombre and solitary spot Celeste had erected a rude hut of dead branches that had fallen to the ground and covered it with the leaves of the palmetto This was the abode she had selected She had no fear of Carey's dogs any more than I had of Epps' It is a fact which I have never been able to explain that there are those whose tracks the hounds will absolutely refuse to follow Celeste was one of them For several nights she came to my cabin for food On one occasion our dogs barked as she approached which aroused Epps and induced him to reconnoitre the premises He did not discover her but after that it was not deemed prudent for her to come to the yard When all was silent I carried provisions to a certain spot agreed upon where she would find them In this manner Celeste passed the greater part of the summer She regained her health and became strong and hearty At all seasons of the year the howlings of wild animals can be heard at night along the borders of the swamps Several times they had made her a midnight call awakening her from slumbers with a growl Terrified by such unpleasant salutations she finally concluded to abandon her lonely dwelling and accordingly returning to her master was scourged her neck meanwhile being fastened in the stocks and sent into the field again The year before my arrival in the country there was a concerted movement among a number of slaves on Bayou Boeuf that terminated tragically indeed It was I presume a matter of newspaper notoriety at the time but all the knowledge I have of it has been derived from the relation of those living at that period in the immediate vicinity of the excitement It has become a subject of general and unfailing interest in every slave hut on the bayou and will doubtless go down to succeeding generations as their chief tradition Lew Cheney with whom I became acquainted a shrewd cunning negro more intelligent than the generality of his race but unscrupulous and full of treachery conceived the project of organizing a company sufficiently strong to fight their way against all opposition to the neighboring territory of Mexico A remote spot far within the depths of the swamp back of Hawkins' plantation was selected as the rallying point Lew flitted from one plantation to another in the dead of night preaching a crusade to Mexico and like Peter the Hermit creating a furor of excitement wherever he appeared At length a large number of runaways were assembled stolen mules and corn gathered from the fields and bacon escaped from smoke houses had been conveyed into the woods The expedition was about ready to proceed when their hiding place was discovered Lew Cheney becoming convinced of the ultimate failure of his project in order to curry favor with his master and avoid the consequences which he foresaw would follow deliberately determined to sacrifice all his companions Departing secretly from the encampment he proclaimed among the planters the number collected in the swamp and instead of stating truly the object they had in view asserted their intention was to emerge from their seclusion the first favorable opportunity and murder every white person along the bayou Such an announcement exaggerated as it passed from mouth to mouth filled the whole country with terror The fugitives were surrounded and taken prisoners carried in chains to Alexandria and hung by the populace Not only those but many who were suspected though entirely innocent were taken from the field and from the cabin and without the shadow of process or form of trial hurried to the scaffold The planters on Bayou Boeuf finally rebelled against such reckless destruction of property but it was not until a regiment of soldiers had arrived from some fort on the Texan frontier demolished the gallows and opened the doors of the Alexandria prison that the indiscriminate slaughter was stayed Lew Cheney escaped and was even rewarded for his treachery He is still living but his name is despised and execrated by all his race throughout the parishes of Rapides and Avoyelles Such an idea as insurrection however is not new among the enslaved population of Bayou Boeuf More than once I have joined in serious consultation when the subject has been discussed and there have been times when a word from me would have placed hundreds of my fellow bondsmen in an attitude of defiance Without arms or ammunition or even with them I saw such a step would result in certain defeat disaster and death and always raised my voice against it During the Mexican war I well remember the extravagant hopes that were excited The news of victory filled the great house with rejoicing but produced only sorrow and disappointment in the cabin In my opinion and I have had opportunity to know something of the feeling of which I speak there are not fifty slaves on the shores of Bayou Boeuf but would hail with unmeasured delight the approach of an invading army They are deceived who flatter themselves that the ignorant and debased slave has no conception of the magnitude of his wrongs They are deceived who imagine that he arises from his knees with back lacerated and bleeding cherishing only a spirit of meekness and forgiveness A day may come it will come if his prayer is heard a terrible day of vengeance when the master in his turn will cry in vain for mercy XVIII O'NIEL THE TANNER CONVERSATION WITH AUNT PHEBE OVERHEARD EPPS IN THE TANNING BUSINESS STABBING OF UNCLE ABRAM THE UGLY WOUND EPPS IS JEALOUS PATSEY IS MISSING HER RETURN FROM SHAW'S HARRIET SHAW'S BLACK WIFE EPPS ENRAGED PATSEY DENIES HIS CHARGES SHE IS TIED DOWN NAKED TO FOUR STAKES THE INHUMAN FLOGGING FLAYING OF PATSEY THE BEAUTY OF THE DAY THE BUCKET OF SALT WATER THE DRESS STIFF WITH BLOOD PATSEY GROWS MELANCHOLY HER IDEA OF GOD AND ETERNITY OF HEAVEN AND FREEDOM THE EFFECT OF SLAVE WHIPPING EPPS' OLDEST SON THE CHILD IS FATHER TO THE MAN WILEY suffered severely at the hands of Master Epps as has been related in the preceding but in this respect he fared no worse than his unfortunate companions Spare the rod was an idea scouted by our master He was constitutionally subject to periods of ill humor and at such times however little provocation there might be a certain amount of punishment was inflicted The circumstances attending the last flogging but one that I received will show how trivial a cause was sufficient with him for resorting to the whip A Mr O'Niel residing in the vicinity of the Big Pine Woods called upon Epps for the purpose of purchasing me He was a tanner and currier by occupation transacting an extensive business and intended to place me at service in some department of his establishment provided he bought me Aunt Phebe while preparing the dinner table in the great house overheard their conversation On returning to the yard at night the old woman ran to meet me designing of course to overwhelm me with the news She entered into a minute repetition of all she had heard and Aunt Phebe was one whose ears never failed to drink in every word of conversation uttered in her hearing She enlarged upon the fact that Massa Epps was g'wine to sell me to a tanner ober in de Pine Woods so long and loudly as to attract the attention of the mistress who standing unobserved on the piazza at the time was listening to our conversation Well Aunt Phebe said I I'm glad of it I'm tired of scraping cotton and would rather be a tanner I hope he'll buy me O'Niel did not effect a purchase however the parties differing as to price and the morning following his arrival departed homewards He had been gone but a short time me when Epps made his appearance in the field Now nothing will more violently enrage a master especially Epps than the intimation of one of his servants that he would like to leave him Mistress Epps had repeated to him my expressions to Aunt Phebe the evening previous as I learned from the latter afterwards the mistress having mentioned to her that she had overheard us On entering the field Epps walked directly to me So Platt you're tired of scraping cotton are you You would like to change your master eh You're fond of moving round traveler ain't ye Ah yes like to travel for your health may be Feel above cotton scraping I 'spose So you're going into the tanning business Good business devilish fine business Enterprising nigger B'lieve I'll go into that business myself Down on your knees and strip that rag off your back I'll try my hand at tanning I begged earnestly and endeavored to soften him with excuses but in vain There was no other alternative so kneeling down I presented my bare back for the application of the lash How do you like tanning he exclaimed as the rawhide descended upon my flesh How do you like tanning he repeated at every blow In this manner he gave me twenty or thirty lashes incessantly giving utterance to the word tanning in one form of expression or another When sufficiently tanned he allowed me to arise and with a half malicious laugh assured me if I still fancied the business he would give me further instruction in it whenever I desired This time he remarked he had only given me a short lesson in tanning the next time he would curry me down Uncle Abram also was frequently treated with great brutality although he was one of the kindest and most faithful creatures in the world He was my cabin mate for years There was a benevolent expression in the old man's face pleasant to behold He regarded us with a kind of parental feeling always counseling us with remarkable gravity and deliberation Returning from Marshall's plantation one afternoon whither I had been sent on some errand of the mistress I found him lying on the cabin floor his clothes saturated with blood He informed me that he had been stabbed While spreading cotton on the scaffold Epps came home intoxicated from Holmesville He found fault with every thing giving many orders so directly contrary that it was impossible to execute any of them Uncle Abram whose faculties were growing dull became confused and committed some blunder of no particular consequence Epps was so enraged thereat that with drunken recklessness he flew upon the old man and stabbed him in the back It was a long ugly wound but did not happen to penetrate far enough to result fatally It was sewed up by the mistress who censured her husband with extreme severity not only denouncing his inhumanity but declaring that she expected nothing else than that he would bring the family to poverty that he would kill all the slaves on the plantation in some of his drunken fits It was no uncommon thing with him to prostrate Aunt Phebe with a chair or stick of wood but the most cruel whipping that ever I was doomed to witness one I can never recall with any other emotion than that of horror was inflicted on the unfortunate Patsey It has been seen that the jealousy and hatred of Mistress Epps made the daily life of her young and agile slave completely miserable I am happy in the belief that on numerous occasions I was the means of averting punishment from the inoffensive girl In Epps' absence the mistress often ordered me to whip her without the remotest provocation I would refuse saying that I feared my master's displeasure and several times ventured to remonstrate with her against the treatment Patsey received I endeavored to impress her with the truth that the latter was not responsible for the acts of which she complained but that she being a slave and subject entirely to her master's will he alone was answerable At length the green eyed monster crept into the soul of Epps also and then it was that he joined with his wrathful wife in an infernal jubilee over the girl's miseries On a Sabbath day in hoeing time not long ago we were on the bayou bank washing our clothes as was our usual custom Presently Patsey was missing Epps called aloud but there was no answer No one had observed her leaving the yard and it was a wonder with us whither she had gone In the course of a couple of hours she was seen approaching from the direction of Shaw's This man as has been intimated was a notorious profligate and withal not on the most friendly terms with Epps Harriet his wife knowing Patsey's troubles was kind to her in consequence of which the latter was in the habit of going over to see her every opportunity Her visits were prompted by friendship merely but the suspicion gradually entered the brain of Epps that another and a baser passion led her thither that it was not Harriet she desired to meet but rather the unblushing libertine his neighbor Patsey found her master in a fearful rage on her return His violence so alarmed her that at first she attempted to evade direct answers to hi his questions which only served to increase his suspicions She finally however drew herself up proudly and in a spirit of indignation boldly denied his charges Missus don't give me soap to wash with as she does the rest said Patsey and you know why I went over to Harriet's to get a piece and saying this she drew it forth from a pocket in her dress and exhibited it to him That's what I went to Shaw's for Massa Epps continued she the Lord knows that was all You lie you black wench shouted Epps I don't lie massa If you kill me I'll stick to that Oh I'll fetch you down I'll learn you to go to Shaw's I'll take the starch out of ye he muttered fiercely through his shut teeth Then turning to me he ordered four stakes to be driven into the ground pointing with the toe of his boot to the places where he wanted them When the stakes were driven down he ordered her to be stripped of every article of dress Ropes were then brought and the naked girl was laid upon her face her wrists and feet each tied firmly to a stake Stepping to the piazza he took down a heavy whip and placing it in my hands commanded me to lash her Unpleasant as it was I was compelled to obey him Nowhere that day on the face of the whole earth I venture to say was there such a demoniac exhibition witnessed as then ensued Mistress Epps stood on the piazza among her children gazing on the scene with an air of heartless satisfaction The slaves were huddled together at a little distance their countenances indicating the sorrow of their hearts Poor Patsey prayed piteously for mercy but her prayers were vain Epps ground his teeth and stamped upon the ground screaming at me like a mad fiend to strike harder Strike harder or your turn will come next you scoundrel he yelled Oh mercy massa oh have mercy do Oh God pity me Patsey exclaimed continually struggling fruitlessly and the flesh quivering at every stroke When I had struck her as many as thirty times I stopped and turned round toward Epps hoping he was satisfied but with bitter oaths and threats he ordered me to continue I inflicted ten or fifteen blows more By this time her back was covered with long welts intersecting each other like net work Epps was yet furious and savage as ever demanding if she would like to go to Shaw's again and swearing he would flog her until she wished she was in h l Throwing down the whip I declared I could punish her no more He ordered me to go on threatening me with a severer flogging than she had received in case of refusal My heart revolted at the inhuman scene and risking the consequences I absolutely refused to raise the whip He then seized it himself and applied it with ten fold greater force than I had The painful cries and shrieks of the tortured Patsey mingling with the loud and angry curses of Epps loaded the air She was terribly lacerated I may say without exaggeration literally flayed The lash was wet with blood which flowed down her sides and dropped upon the ground At length she ceased struggling Her head sank listlessly on the ground Her screams and supplications gradually decreased and died away into a low moan She no longer writhed and shrank beneath the lash when it bit out small pieces of her flesh I thought that she was dying It was the Sabbath of the Lord The fields smiled in the warm sunlight the birds chirped merrily amidst the foliage of the trees peace and happiness seemed to reign everywhere save in the bosoms of Epps and his panting victim and the silent witnesses around him The tempestuous emotions that were raging there were little in harmony with the calm and quiet beauty of the day I could look on Epps only with unutterable loathing and abhorrence and thought within myself Thou devil sooner or later somewhere in the course of eternal justice thou shalt answer for this sin Finally he ceased whipping from mere exhaustion and ordered Phebe to bring a bucket of salt and water After washing her thoroughly with this I was told to take her to her cabin Untying the ropes I raised her in my arms She was unable to stand and as her head rested on my shoulder she repeated many times in a faint voice scarcely perceptible Oh Platt oh Platt but nothing further Her dress was replaced but it clung to her back and was soon stiff with blood We laid her on some boards in the hut where she remained a long time with eyes closed and groaning in agony At night Phebe applied melted tallow to her wounds and so far as we were able all endeavored to assist and console her Day after day she lay in her cabin upon her face the sores preventing her resting in any other position A blessed thing it would have been for her days and weeks and months of misery it would have saved her had she never lifted up her head in life again Indeed from that time forward she was not what she had been The burden of a deep melancholy weighed heavily on her spirits She no longer moved with that buoyant and elastic step there was not that mirthful sparkle in her eyes that formerly distinguished her The bounding vigor the sprightly laughter loving spirit of her youth were gone She fell into a mournful and desponding mood and often times would start up in her sleep and with raised hands plead for mercy She became more silent than she was toiling all day in our midst not uttering a word A care worn pitiful expression settled on her face and it was her humor now to weep rather than rejoice If ever there was a broken heart one crushed and blighted by the rude grasp of suffering misfortune it was Patsey's She had been reared no better than her master's beast looked upon merely as a valuable and handsome animal and consequently possessed but a limited amount of knowledge And yet a faint light cast its rays over her intellect so that it was not wholly dark She had a dim perception of God and of eternity and a still more dim perception of a Saviour who had died even for such as her She entertained but confused notions of a future life not comprehending the distinction between the corporeal and spiritual existence Happiness in her mind was exemption from stripes from labor from the cruelty of masters and overseers Her idea of the joy of heaven was simply rest and is fully expressed in these of a melancholy bard I ask no paradise on high With cares on earth oppressed The only heaven for which I sigh Is rest eternal rest It is a mistaken opinion that prevails in some quarters that the slave does not understand the term does not comprehend the idea of freedom Even on Bayou Boeuf where I conceive slavery exists in its most abject and cruel form where it exhibits features altogether unknown in more northern States the most ignorant of them generally know full well its meaning They understand the privileges and exemptions that belong to it that it would bestow upon them the fruits of their own labors and that it would secure to them the enjoyment of domestic happiness They do not fail to observe the difference between their own condition and the meanest white man's and to realize the injustice of the laws which place it in his power not only to appropriate the profits of their industry but to subject them to unmerited and unprovoked punishment without remedy or the right to resist or to remonstrate Patsey's life especially after her whipping was one long dream of liberty Far away to her fancy an immeasurable distance she knew there was a land of freedom A thousand times she had heard that somewhere in the distant North there were no slaves no masters In her imagination it was an enchanted region the Paradise of the earth To dwell where the black man may work for himself live in his own cabin till his own soil was a blissful dream of Patsey's a dream alas the fulfillment of which she can never realize The effect of these exhibitions of brutality on the household of the slave holder is apparent Epps' oldest son is an intelligent lad of ten or twelve years of age It is pitiable sometimes to see him chastising for instance the venerable Uncle Abram He will call the old man to account and if in his childish judgement it is necessary sentence him to a certain number of lashes which he proceeds to inflict with much gravity and deliberation Mounted on his pony he often rides into the field with his whip playing the overseer greatly to his father's delight Without discrimination at such times he applies the rawhide urging the slaves forward with shouts and occasional expressions of profanity while the old man laughs and commends him as a thorough going boy The child is father to the man and with such training whatever may be his natural disposition it cannot well be otherwise than that on arriving at maturity the sufferings and miseries of the slave will be looked upon with entire indifference The influence of the iniquitous system necessarily fosters an unfeeling and cruel spirit even in the bosoms of those who among their equals are regarded as humane and generous Young Master Epps possessed some noble qualities yet no process of reasoning could lead him to comprehend that in the eye of the Almighty there is no distinction of color He looked upon the black man simply as an animal differing in no respect from any other animal save in the gift of speech and the possession of somewhat higher instincts and therefore the more valuable To work like his father's mules to be whipped and kicked and scourged through life to address the white man with hat in hand and eyes bent servilely on the earth in his mind was the natural and proper destiny of the slave Brought up with such ideas in the notion that we stand without the pale of humanity no wonder the oppressors of my people are a pitiless and unrelenting race XIX AVERY ON BAYOU ROUGE PECULIARITY OF DWELLINGS EPPS BUILDS A NEW HOUSE BASS THE CARPENTER HIS NOBLE QUALITIES HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND ECCENTRICITIES BASS AND EPPS DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF SLAVERY EPPS' OPINION OF BASS I MAKE MYSELF KNOWN TO HIM OUR CONVERSATION HIS SURPRISE THE MIDNIGHT MEETING ON THE BAYOU BANK BASS' ASSURANCES DECLARES WAR AGAINST SLAVERY WHY I DID NOT DISCLOSE MY HISTORY BASS WRITES LETTERS COPY OF HIS LETTER TO MESSRS PARKER AND PERRY THE FEVER OF SUSPENSE DISAPPOINTMENTS BASS ENDEAVORS TO CHEER ME MY FAITH IN HIM IN the month of June in pursuance of a previous contract Mr Avery a carpenter of Bayou Rouge commenced the erection of a house for Master Epps It has previously been stated that there are no cellars on Bayou Boeuf on the other hand such is the low and swampy nature of the ground the great houses are usually built upon spiles Another peculiarity is the rooms are not plastered but the ceiling and sides are covered with matched cypress boards painted such color as most pleases the owner's taste Generally the plank and boards are sawed by slaves with whip saws there being no waterpower upon which mills might be built within many miles When the planter erects for himself a dwelling therefore there is plenty of extra work for his slaves Having had some experience under Tibeats as a carpenter I was taken from the field altogether on the arrival of Avery and his hands Among them was one to whom I owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude Only for him in all probability I should have ended my days in slavery He was my deliverer a man whose true heart overflowed with noble and generous emotions To the last moment of my existence I shall remember him with feelings of thankfulness His name was Bass and at that time he resided in Marksville It will be difficult to convey a correct impression of his appearance or character He was a large man between forty and fifty years old of light complexion and light hair He was very cool and self possessed fond of argument but always speaking with extreme deliberation He was that kind of person whose peculiarity of manner was such that nothing he uttered ever gave offence What would be intolerable coming from the lips of another could be said by him with impunity There was not a man on Red River perhaps that agreed with him on the subject of politics or religion and not a man I venture to say who discussed either of those subjects half as much It seemed to be taken for granted that he would espouse the unpopular side of every local question and it always created amusement rather than displeasure among his auditors to listen to the ingenious and original manner in which he maintained the controversy He was a bachelor an old bachelor according to the true acceptation of the term having no kindred living as he knew of in the world Neither had he any permanent abiding place wandering from one State to another as his fancy dictated He had lived in Marksville three or four years and in the prosecution of his business as a carpenter and in consequence likewise of his peculiarities was quite extensively known throughout the parish of Avoyelles He was liberal to a fault and his many acts of kindness and transparent goodness of heart rendered him popular in the community the sentiment of which he unceasingly combated He was a native of Canada from whence he had wandered in early life and after visiting all the principal localities in the northern and western States in the course of his peregrinations arrived in the unhealthy region of the Red River His last removal was from Illinois Whither he has now gone I regret to be obliged to say is unknown to me He gathered up his effects and departed quietly from Marksville the day before I did the suspicions of his instrumentality in procuring my liberation rendering such a step necessary For the commission of a just and righteous act he would undoubtedly have suffered death had he remained within reach of the slavewhipping tribe on Bayou Boeuf One day while working on the new house Bass and Epps became engaged in a controversy to which as will be readily supposed I listened with absorbing interest They were discussing the subject of Slavery I tell you what it is Epps said Bass it's all wrong all wrong sir there's no justice nor righteousness in it I wouldn't own a slave if I was rich as Croesus which I am not as is perfectly well understood more particularly among my creditors There's another humbug the credit system humbug sir no credit no debt Credit leads a man into temptation Cash down is the only thing that will deliver him from evil But this question of Slavery what right have you to your niggers when you come down to the point What right said Epps laughing why I bought 'em and paid for 'em Of course you did the law says you have the right to hold a nigger but begging the law's pardon it lies Yes Epps when the law says that it's a liar and the truth is not in it Is every thing right because the law allows it Suppose they'd pass a law taking away your liberty and making you a slave Oh that ain't a supposable case said Epps still laughing hope you don't compare me to a nigger Bass Well Bass answered gravely no not exactly But I have seen niggers before now as good as I am and I have no acquaintance with any white man in these parts that I consider a whit better than myself Now in the sight of God what is the difference Epps between a white man and a black one All the difference in the world replied Epps You might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon Now I've seen one of them critters in Orleans that knowed just as much as any nigger I've got You'd call them feller citizens I s'pose and Epps indulged in a loud laugh at his own wit Look here Epps continued his companion you can't laugh me down in that way Some men are witty and some ain't so witty as they think they are Now let me ask you a question Are all men created free and equal as the Declaration of Independence holds they are Yes responded Epps but all men niggers and monkeys ain't and hereupon he broke forth into a more boisterous laugh than before There are monkeys among white people as well as black when you come to that coolly remarked Bass I know some white men that use arguments no sensible monkey would But let that pass These niggers are human beings If they don't know as much as their masters whose fault is it They are not allowed to know anything You have books and papers and can go where you please and gather intelligence in a thousand ways But your slaves have no privileges You'd whip one of them if caught reading a book They are held in bondage generation after generation deprived of mental improvement and who can expect them to possess much knowledge If they are not brought down to a level with the brute creation you slaveholders will never be blamed for it If they are baboons or stand no higher in the scale of intelligence than such animals you and men like you will have to answer for it There's a sin a fearful sin resting on this nation that will not go unpunished forever There will be a reckoning yet yes Epps there's a day coming that will burn as an oven It may be sooner or it may be later but it's a coming as sure as the Lord is just If you lived up among the Yankees in New England said Epps I expect you'd be one of them cursed fanatics that know more than the constitution and go about peddling clocks and coaxing niggers to run away If I was in New England returned Bass I would be just what I am here I would say that Slavery was an iniquity and ought to be abolished I would say there was no reason nor justice in the law or the constitution that allows one man to hold another man in bondage It would be hard for you to lose your property to be sure but it wouldn't be half as hard as it would be to lose your liberty You have no more right to your freedom in exact justice than Uncle Abram yonder Talk about black skin and black blood why how many slaves are there on this bayou as white as either of us And what difference is there in the color of the soul Pshaw the whole system is as absurd as it is cruel You may own niggers and behanged but I wouldn't own one for the best plantation in Louisiana You like to hear yourself talk Bass better than any man I know of You would argue that black was white or white black if any body would contradict you Nothing suits you in this world and I don't believe you will be satisfied with the next if you should have your choice in them Conversations substantially like the foregoing were not unusual between the two after this Epps drawing him out more for the purpose of creating a laugh at his expense than with a view of fairly discussing the merits of the question He looked upon Bass as a man ready to say anything merely for the pleasure of hearing his own voice as somewhat self conceited perhaps contending against his faith and judgment in order simply to exhibit his dexterity in argumentation He remained at Epps through the summer visiting Marksville generally once a fortnight The more I saw of him the more I became convinced he was a man in whom I could confide Nevertheless my previous ill fortune had taught me to be extremely cautious It was not my place to speak to a white man except when spoken to but I omitted no opportunity of throwing myself in his way and endeavored constantly in every possible manner to attract his attention In the early part of August he and myself were at work alone in the house the other carpenters having left and Epps being absent in the field Now was the time if ever to broach the subject and I resolved to do it and submit to whatever consequences might ensue We were busily at work in the afternoon when I stopped suddenly and said Master Bass I want to ask you what part of the country you came from Why Platt what put that into your head he answered You wouldn't know if I should tell you After a moment or two he added I was born in Canada now guess where that is Oh I know where Canada is said I I have been there myself Yes I expect you are well acquainted all through that country he remarked laughing incredulously As sure as I live Master Bass I replied I have been there I have been in Montreal and Kingston and Queenston and a great many places in Canada and I have been in York State too in Buffalo and Rochester and Albany and can tell you the names of the villages on the Erie canal and the Champlain canal Bass turned round and gazed at me a long time without uttering a syllable How came you here he inquired at length Master Bass I answered if justice had been done I never would have been here Well how's this said he Who are you You have been in Canada sure enough I know all the places you mention How did you happen to get here Come tell me all about it I have no friends here was my reply that I can put confidence in I am afraid to tell you though I don't believe you would tell Master Epps if I should He assured me earnestly he would keep every word I might speak to him a profound secret and his curiosity was evidently strongly excited It was a long story I informed him and would take some time to relate it Master Epps would be back soon but if he would see me that night after all were asleep I would repeat it to him He consented readily to the arrangement and directed me to come into the building where we were then at work and I would find him there About midnight when all was still and quiet I crept cautiously from my cabin and silently entering the unfinished building found him awaiting me After further assurances on his part that I should not be betrayed I began a relation of the history of my life and misfortunes He was deeply interested asking numerous questions in reference to localities and events Having ended my story I besought him to write to some of my friends at the North acquainting them with my situation and begging them to forward free papers or take such steps as they might consider proper to secure my release He promised to do so but dwelt upon the danger of such an act in case of detection and now impressed upon me the great necessity of strict silence and secresy Before we parted our plan of operation was arranged We agreed to meet the next night at a specified place among the high weeds on the bank of the bayou some distance from master's dwelling There he was write down on paper the names and address of several persons old friends in the North to whom he would direct letters during his next visit to Marksville It was not deemed prudent to meet in the new house inasmuch as the light it would be necessary to use might possibly be discovered In the course of the day I managed to obtain a few matches and a piece of candle unperceived from the kitchen during a temporary absence of Aunt Phebe Bass had pencil and paper in his tool chest At the appointed hour we met on the bayou bank and creeping among the high weeds I lighted the candle while he drew forth pencil and paper and prepared for business I gave him the names of William Perry Cephas Parker and Judge Marvin all of Saratoga Springs Saratoga county New York I had been employed by the latter in the United States Hotel and had transacted business with the former to a considerable extent and trusted that at least one of them would be still living at that place He carefully wrote the names and then remarked thoughtfully It is so many years since you left Saratoga all these men may be dead or may have removed You say you obtained papers at the custom house in New York Probably there is a record of them there and I think it would be well to write and ascertain I agreed with him and again repeated the circumstances related heretofore connected with my visit to the custom house with Brown and Hamilton We lingered on the bank of the bayou an hour or more conversing upon the subject which now engrossed our thoughts I could no longer doubt his fidelity and freely spoke to him of the many sorrows I had borne in silence and so long I spoke of my wife and children mentioning their names and ages and dwelling upon the unspeakable happiness it would be to clasp them to my heart once more before I died I caught him by the hand and with tears and passionate entreaties implored him to befriend me to restore me to my kindred and to liberty promising I would weary Heaven the remainder of my life with prayers that it would bless and prosper him In the enjoyment of freedom surrounded by the associations of youth and restored to the bosom of my family that promise is not yet forgotten nor shall it ever be so long as I have strength to raise my imploring eyes on high Oh blessings on his kindly voice and on his silver hair And blessings on his whole life long until he meet me there He overwhelmed me with assurances of friendship and faithfulness saying he had never before taken so deep an interest in the fate of any one He spoke of himself in a somewhat mournful tone as a lonely man a wanderer about the world that he was growing old and must soon reach the end of his earthly journey and lie down to his final rest without kith or kin to mourn for him or to remember him that his life was of little value to himself and henceforth should be devoted to the accomplishment of my liberty and to an unceasing warfare against the accursed shame of Slavery After this time we seldom spoke to or recognized each other He was moreover less free in his conversation with Epps on the subject of Slavery The remotest suspicion that there was any unusual intimacy any secret understanding between us never once entered the mind of Epps or any other person white or black on the plantation I am often asked with an air of incredulity how I succeeded so many years in keeping from my daily and constant companions the knowledge of my true name and history The terrible lesson Burch taught me impressed indelibly upon my mind the danger and uselessness of asserting I was a freeman There was no possibility of any slave being able to assist me while on the other hand there was a possibility of his exposing me When it is recollected the whole current of my thoughts for twelve years turned to the contemplation of escape it will not be wondered at that I was always cautious and on my guard It would have been an act of folly to have proclaimed my right to freedom it would only have subjected me to severer scrutiny probably have consigned me to some more distant and inaccessible region than even Bayou Boeuf Edwin Epps was a person utterly regardless of a black man's rights or wrongs utterly destitute of any natural sense of justice as I well knew It was important therefore not only as regarded my hope of deliverance but also as regarded the few personal priviliges I was as permitted to enjoy to keep from him the history of my life The Saturday night subsequent to our interview at the water's edge Bass went home to Marksville The next day being Sunday he employed himself in his own room writing letters One he directed to the Collector of Customs at New York another to Judge Marvin and another to Messrs Parker and Perry jointly The latter was the one which led to my recovery He subscribed my true name but in the postscript intimated I was not the writer The letter itself shows that he considered himself engaged in a dangerous undertaking no less than running the risk of his life if detected I did not see the letter before it was mailed but have since obtained a copy which is here inserted Bayou Boeuf August Mr WILLIAM PERRY or Mr CEPHAS PARKER Gentlemen It having been a long time since I have seen or heard from you and not knowing that you are living it is with uncertainty that I write to you but the necessity of the case must be my excuse Having been born free just across the river from you I am certain you must know me and I am here now a slave I wish you to obtain free papers for me and forward them to me at Marksville Louisiana Parish of Avoyelles and oblige Yours SOLOMON NORTHUP The way I came to be a slave I was taken sick in Washington City and was insensible for some time When I recovered my reason I was robbed of my free papers and in irons on my way to this State and have never been able to get any one to write for me until now and he that is writing for me runs the risk of his life if detected The allusion to myself in the work recently issued entitled A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin contains the first part of this letter omitting the postscript Neither are the full names of the gentlemen to whom it is directed correctly stated there being a slight discrepancy probably a typographical error To the postscript more than to the body of the communication am I indebted for my liberation as will presently be seen When Bass returned from Marksville he informed me of what he had done We continued our midnight consultations never speaking to each other through the day excepting as it was necessary about the work As nearly as he was able to ascertain it would require two weeks for the letter to reach Saratoga in due course of mail and the same length of time for an answer to return Within six weeks at the farthest we concluded an answer would arrive if it arrived at all A great many suggestions were now made and a great deal of conversation took place between us as to the most safe and proper course to pursue on receipt of the free papers They would stand between him and harm in case we were overtaken and arrested leaving the country altogether It would be no infringement of law however much it might provoke individual hostility to assist a freeman to regain his freedom At the end of four weeks he was again at Marksville but no answer had arrived I was sorely disappointed but still reconciled myself with the reflection that sufficient length of time had not yet elapsed that there might have been delays and that I could not reasonably expect one so soon Six seven eight and ten weeks passed by however and nothing came I was in a fever of suspense whenever Bass visited Marksville and could scarcely close my eyes until his return Finally my master's house was finished and the time came when Bass must leave me The night before his departure I was wholly given up to despair I had clung to him as a drowning man clings to the floating spar knowing if it ships from his grasp he must forever sink beneath the waves The all glorious hope upon which I had laid such eager hold was crumbling to ashes in my hands I felt as if sinking down down amidst the bitter waters of Slavery from the unfathomable depths of which I should never rise again The generous heart of my friend and benefactor was touched with pity at the sight of my distress He endeavored to cheer me up promising to return the day before Christmas and if no intelligence was received in the meantime some further step would be undertaken to effect our design He exhorted me to keep up my spirits to rely upon his continued efforts in my behalf assuring me in most earnest and impressive language that my liberation should from thenceforth be the chief object of his thoughts In his absence the time passed slowly indeed I looked forward to Christmas with intense anxiety and impatience I had about given up the expectation of receiving any answer to the letters They might have miscarried or might have been misdirected Perhaps those at Saratoga to whom they had been addressed were all dead perhaps engaged in their pursuits they did not consider the fate of an obscure unhappy black man of sufficient importance to be noticed My whole reliance was in Bass The faith I had in him was continually re assuring me and enabled me to stand up against the tide of disappointment that had overwhelmed me So wholly was I absorbed in reflecting upon my situation and prospects that the hands with whom I labored in the field often observed it Patsey would ask me if I was sick and Uncle Abram and Bob and Wiley frequently expressed a curiosity to know what I could be thinking about so steadily But I evaded their inquiries with some light remark and kept my thoughts locked closely in my breast XX BASS FAITHFUL TO HIS WORD HIS ARRIVAL ON CHRISTMAS EVE THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING AN INTERVIEW THE MEETING IN THE CABIN NON ARRIVAL OF THE LETTER BASS ANNOUNCES HIS INTENTION TO PROCEED NORTH CHRISTMAS CONVERSATION BETWEEN EPPS AND BASS YOUNG MISTRESS M'COY THE BEAUTY OF BAYOU BOEUF THE NE PLUS ULTRA OF DINNERS MUSIC AND DANCING PRESENCE OF THE MISTRESS HER EXCEEDING BEAUTY THE LAST SLAVE DANCE WILLIAM PIERCE OVERSLEEP MYSELF THE LAST WHIPPING DESPONDENCY THE COLD MORNING EPPS' THREATS THE PASSING CARRIAGE STRANGERS APPROACHING THROUGH THE COTTON FIELD LAST HOUR ON BAYOU BOEUF FAITHFUL to his word the day before Christmas just at night fall Bass came riding into the yard How are you said Epps shaking him by the hand glad to see you He would not have been very glad had he known the object of his errand Quite well quite well answered Bass Had some business out on the bayou and concluded to call and see you and stay over night Epps ordered one of the slaves to take charge of his horse and with much talk and laughter they passed into the house together not however until Bass had looked at me significantly as much as to say Keep dark we understand each other It was ten o'clock at night before the labors of the day were performed when I entered the cabin At that time Uncle Abram and Bob occupied it with me I laid down upon my board and feigned I was asleep When my companions had fallen into a profound slumber I moved stealthily out of the door and watched and listened attentively for some sign or sound from Bass There I stood until long after midnight but nothing could be seen or heard As I suspected he dared not leave the house through fear of exciting the suspicion of some of the family I judged correctly he would rise earlier than was his custom and take the opportunity of seeing me before Epps was up Accordingly I aroused Uncle Abram an hour sooner than usual and sent him into the house to build a fire which at that season of the year is a part of Uncle Abram's duties I also gave Bob a violent shake and asked him if he intended to sleep till noon saying master would be up before the mules were fed He knew right well the consequence that would follow such an event and jumping to his feet was at the horse pasture in a twinkling Presently when both were gone Bass slipped into the cabin No letter yet Platt said he The announcement fell upon my heart like lead Oh do write again Master Bass I cried I will give you the names of a great many I know Surely they are not all dead Surely some one will pity me No use Bass replied no use I have made up my mind to that I fear the Marksville post master will mistrust something I have inquired so often at his office Too uncertain too dangerous Then it is all over I exclaimed Oh my God how can I end my days here You're not going to end them here he said unless you die very soon I've thought this matter all have come to a determination There are more ways than one to manage this business and a better and surer way than writing letters I have a job or two on hand which can be completed by March or April By that time I shall have a considerable sum of money and then Platt I am going to Saratoga myself I could scarcely credit my own senses as the words fell from his lips But he assured me in a manner that left no doubt of the sincerity of his intention that if his life was spared until spring he should certainly undertake the journey I have lived in this region long enough he considered I may as well be in one place as another For a long time I have been thinking of going back more to the place where I was born I'm tired of Slavery as well as you If I can succeed in getting you away from here it will be a good act that I shall like to think of all my life And I shall succeed Platt I'm bound to do it Now let me tell you what I want Epps will be up soon and it won't do to be caught here Think of a great many men at Saratoga and Sandy Hill and in that neighborhood who once knew you I shall make excuse to come here again in the course of the winter when I will write down their names I will then know who to call on when I go north Think of all you can Cheer up Don't be discouraged I'm with you life or death Good bye God bless you and saying this he left the cabin quickly and entered the great house It was Christmas morning the happiest day in the whole year for the slave That morning he need not hurry to the field with his gourd and cotton bag Happiness sparkled in the eyes and overspread the countenances of all The time of feasting and dancing had come The cane and cotton fields were deserted That day the clean dress was to be donned the red ribbon displayed there were to be re unions and joy and laughter and hurrying to and fro It was to be a day of liberty among the children of Slavery Wherefore they were happy and rejoiced After breakfast Epps and Bass sauntered about the yard conversing upon the price of cotton and various other topics Where do your niggers hold Christmas Bass inquired Platt is going to Tanners to day His fiddle is in great demand They want him at Marshall's Monday and Miss Mary McCoy on the old Norwood plantation writes me a note that she wants him to play for her niggers Tuesday He is rather a smart boy ain't he said Bass Come here Platt he added looking at me as I walked up to them as if he had never thought before to take any special notice of me Yes replied Epps taking hold of my arm and feeling it there isn't a bad joint in him There ain't a boy on the bayou worth more than he is perfectly sound and no bad tricks D n him he isn't like other niggers doesn't look like 'em don't act like 'em I was offered seventeen hundred dollars for him last week And didn't take it Bass inquired with an air of surprise Take it no devilish clear of it Why he's a reg'lar genius can make a plough beam wagon tongue anything as well as you can Marshall wanted to put up one of his niggers agin him and raffle for them but I told him I would see the devil have him first I don't see anything remarkable about him Bass observed Why just feel of him no Epps rejoined You don't see a boy very often put together any closer than he is He's a thin skin'd cuss and won't bear as much whipping as some but he's got the muscle in him and no mistake Bass felt of me turned me round and made a thorough examination Epps all the while dwelling on my good points But his visitor seemed to take but little interest finally in the subject and consequently it was dropped Bass soon departed giving me another sly look of recognition and significance as he trotted out of the yard When he was gone I obtained a pass and started for Tanner's not Peter Tanner's of whom mention has previously been made but a relative of his I played during the day and most of the night spending the next day Sunday in my cabin Monday I crossed the bayou to Douglas Marshall's all Epps' slaves accompanying me and on Tuesday went to the old Norwood place which is the third plantation above Marshall's on the same side of the water This estate is now owned by Miss Mary McCoy a lovely girl some twenty years of age She is the beauty and the glory of Bayou Bouef She owns about a hundred working hands besides a great many house servants yard boys and young children Her brother in law who resides on the adjoining estate is her general agent She is beloved by all her slaves and good reason indeed have they to be thankful that they have fallen into such gentle hands Nowhere on the bayou are there such feasts such merrymaking as at young Madam McCoy's Thither more than to any other place do the old and the young for miles around love to repair in the time of the Christmas holiday for nowhere else can they find such delicious repasts nowhere else can they hear a voice speaking to them so pleasantly No one is so well beloved no one fills so large a space in the hearts of a thousand slaves as young Madam McCoy the orphan mistress of the old Norwood estate On my arrival at her place I found two or three hundred had assembled The table was prepared in a long building which she had erected expressly for her slaves to dance in It was covered with every variety of food the country afforded and was pronounced by general acclamation to be the rarest of dinners Roast turkey pig chicken duck and all kinds of meat baked boiled and broiled formed a line the whole length of the extended table while the vacant spaces were filled with tarts jellies and frosted cake and pastry of many kinds The young mistress walked around the table smiling and saying a kind word to each one and seemed to enjoy the scene exceedingly When the dinner was over the tables were removed to make room for the dancers I tuned my violin and struck up a lively air while some joined in a nimble reel others patted and sang their simple but melodious songs filling the great room with music mingled with the sound of human voices and the clatter of many feet In the evening the mistress returned and stood in the door a long time looking at us She was magnificently arrayed Her dark hair and eyes contrasted strongly with her clear and delicate complexion Her form was slender but commanding and her movement was a combination of unaffected dignity and grace As she stood there clad in her rich apparel her face animated with pleasure I thought I had never looked upon a human being half so beautiful I dwell with delight upon the description of this fair and gentle lady not only because she inspired me with emotions of gratitude and admiration but because I would have the reader understand that all slave owners on Bayou Boeuf are not like Epps or Tibeats or Jim Burns Occasionally can be found rarely it may be indeed a good man like William Ford or an angel of kindness like young Mistress McCoy Tuesday concluded the three holidays Epps yearly allowed us On my way home Wednesday morning while passing the plantation of William Pierce that gentleman hailed me saying he had received a line from Epps brought down by William Varnell permitting him to detain me for the purpose of playing for his slaves that night It was the last time I was destined to witness a slave dance on the shores of Bayou Boeuf The party at Pierce's continued their jollification until broad daylight when I returned to my master's house somewhat wearied with the loss of rest but rejoicing in the possession of numerous bits and picayunes which the whites who were pleased with my musical performances had contributed On Saturday morning for the first time in years I overslept myself I was frightened on coming out of the cabin to find the slaves were already in the field They had preceded me some fifteen minutes Leaving my dinner and water gourd I hurried after them as fast as I could move It was not yet sunrise but Epps was on the piazza as I left the hut and cried out to me that it was a pretty time of day to be getting up By extra exertion my row was up when he came out after breakfast This however was no excuse for the offence of oversleeping Bidding me strip and lie down he gave me ten or fifteen lashes at the conclusion of which he inquired if I thought after that I could get up sometime in the morning I expressed myself quite positively that I could and with back stinging with pain went about my work The following day Sunday my thoughts were upon Bass and the probabilities and hopes which hung upon his action and determination I considered the uncertainty of life that if it should be the will of God that he should die my prospect of deliverance and all expectation of happiness in this world would be wholly ended and destroyed My sore back perhaps did not have a tendency to render me unusually cheerful I felt down hearted and unhappy all day long and when I laid down upon the hard board at night my heart was oppressed with such a load of grief it seemed that it must break Monday morning the third of January we were in the field betimes It was a raw cold morning such as is unusual in that region I was in advance Uncle Abram next to me behind him Bob Patsey and Wiley with our cotton bags about our necks Epps happened a rare thing indeed to come out that morning without his whip He swore in a manner that would shame a pirate that we were doing nothing Bob ventured to say that his fingers were so numb with cold he couldn't pick fast Epps cursed himself for not having brought his rawhide and declared that when he came out again he would warm us well yes he would make us all hotter than that fiery realm in which I am sometimes compelled to believe he will himself eventually reside With these fervent expressions he left us When out of hearing we commenced talking to each other saying how hard it was to be compelled to keep up our tasks with numb fingers how unreasonable master was and speaking of him generally in no flattering terms Our conversation was interrupted by a carriage passing rapidly towards the house Looking up we saw two men approaching us through the cotton field Having now brought down this narrative to the last hour I was to spend on Bayou Boeuf having gotten through my last cotton picking and about to bid Master Epps farewell I must beg the reader to go back with me to the month of August to follow Bass' letter on its long journey to Saratoga to learn the effect it produced and that while I was repining and despairing in the slave hut of Edwin Epps through the friendship of Bass and the goodness of Providence all things were working together for my deliverance XXI THE LETTER REACHES SARATOGA IS FORWARDED TO ANNE IS LAID BEFORE HENRY B NORTHUP THE STATUTE OF MAY ITS PROVISIONS ANNE'S MEMORIAL TO THE GOVERNOR THE AFFIDAVITS ACCOMPANYING IT SENATOR SOULE'S LETTER DEPARTURE OF THE AGENT APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR ARRIVAL AT MARKSVILLE THE HON JOHN P WADDILL THE CONVERSATION ON NEW YORK POLITICS IT SUGGESTS A FORTUNATE IDEA THE MEETING WITH BASS THE SECRET OUT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED DEPARTURE OF NORTHUP AND THE SHERIFF FROM MARKSVILLE FOR BAYOU BOEUF ARRANGEMENTS ON THE WAY REACH EPPS' PLANTATION DISCOVER HIS SLAVES IN THE COTTON FIELD THE MEETING THE FAREWELL I AM indebted to Mr Henry B Northup and others for many of the particulars contained in this The letter written by Bass directed to Parker and Perry and which was deposited in the post office in Marksville on the th day of August arrived at Saratoga in the early part of September Some time previous to this Anne had removed to Glens Falls Warren county where she had charge of the kitchen in Carpenter's Hotel She kept house however lodging with our children and was only absent from them during such time as the discharge of her duties in the hotel required Messrs Parker and Perry on receipt of the letter forwarded it immediately to Anne On reading it the children were all excitement and without delay hastened to the neighboring village of Sandy Hill to consult Henry B Northup and obtain his advice and assistance in the matter Upon examination that gentleman found among the statutes of the State an act providing for the recovery of free citizens from slavery It was passed May and is entitled An act more effectually to protect the free citizens of this State from being kidnapped or reduced to slavery It provides that it shall be the duty of the Governor upon the receipt of satisfactory information that any free citizen or inhabitant of this State is wrongfully held in another State or Territory of the United States upon the allegation or pretence that such person is a slave or by color of any usage or rule of law is deemed or taken to be a slave to take such measures to procure the restoration of such person to liberty as he shall deem necessary And to that end he is authorized to appoint and employ an agent and directed to furnish him with such credentials and instructions as will be likely to accomplish the object of his appointment It requires the agent so appointed to proceed to collect the proper proof to establish the right of such person to his freedom to perform such journeys take such measures institute such legal proceedings c as may be necessary to return such person to this State and charges all expenses incurred in carrying the act into effect upon moneys not otherwise appropriated in the treasury It was necessary to establish two facts to the satisfaction of the Governor First that I was a free citizen of New York and secondly that I was wrongfully held in bondage As to the first point there was no difficulty all the older inhabitants in the vicinity being ready to testify to it The second point rested entirely upon the letter to Parker and Perry written in an unknown hand and upon the letter penned on board the brig Orleans which unfortunately had been mislaid or lost A memorial was prepared directed to his excellency Governor Hunt setting forth her marriage my departure to Washington city the receipt of the letters that I was a free citizen and such other facts as were deemed important and was signed and verified by Anne Accompanying this memorial were several affidavits of prominent citizens of Sandy Hill and Fort Edward corroborating fully the statements it contained and also a request of several well known gentlemen to the Governor that Henry B Northup be appointed agent under the legislative act On reading the memorial and affidavits his excellency took a lively interest in the matter and on the d day of November under the seal of the State constituted appointed and employed Henry B Northup Esq an agent with full power to effect my restoration and to take such measures as would See Appendix A be most likely to accomplish it and instructing him to proceed to Louisiana with all convenient dispatch The pressing nature of Mr Northup's professional and political engagements delayed his departure until December On the fourteenth day of that month he left Sandy Hill and proceeded to Washington The Hon Pierre Soule Senator in Congress from Louisiana Hon Mr Conrad Secretary of War and Judge Nelson of the Supreme Court of the United States upon hearing a statement of the facts and examining his commission and certified copies of the memorial and affidavits furnished him with open letters to gentlemen in Louisiana strongly urging their assistance in accomplishing the object of his appointment Senator Soule especially interested himself in the matter insisting in forcible language that it was the duty and interest of every planter in his State to aid in restoring me to freedom and trusted the sentiments of honor and justice in the bosom of every citizen of the commonwealth would enlist him at once in my behalf Having obtained these valuable letters Mr Northup returned to Baltimore and proceeded from thence to Pittsburgh It was his original intention under advice of friends at Washington to go directly to New Orleans and consult the authorities of that city Providentially however on arriving at the mouth of Red River he changed his mind Had he continued on he would not have met with Bass in See Appendix B which case the search for me would probably have been fruitless Taking passage on the first steamer that arrived he pursued his journey up Red River a sluggish winding stream flowing through a vast region of primitive forests and impenetrable swamps almost wholly destitute of inhabitants About nine o'clock in the forenoon January st he left the steamboat at Marksville and proceeded directly to Marksville Court House a small village four miles in the interior From the fact that the letter to Messrs Parker and Perry was post marked at Marksville it was supposed by him that I was in that place or its immediate vicinity On reaching this town he at once laid his business before the Hon John P Waddill a legal gentleman of distinction and a man of fine genius and most noble impulses After reading the letters and documents presented him and listening to a representation of the circumstances under which I had been carried away into captivity Mr Waddill at once proffered his services and entered into the affair with great zeal and earnestness He in common with others of like elevated character looked upon the kidnapped with abhorrence The title of his fellow parishioners and clients to the property which constituted the larger proportion of their wealth not only depended upon the good faith in which slave sales were transacted but he was a man in whose honorable heart emotions of indignation were aroused by such an instance of injustice Marksville although occupying a prominent position and standing out in impressive italics on the map of Louisiana is in fact but a small and insignificant hamlet Aside from the tavern kept by a jolly and generous boniface the court house inhabited by lawless cows and swine in the seasons of vacation and a high gallows with its dissevered rope dangling in the air there is little to attract the attention of the stranger Solomon Northup was a name Mr Waddill had never heard but he was confident that if there was a slave bearing that appellation in Marksville or vicinity his black boy Tom would know him Tom was accordingly called but in all his extensive circle of acquaintances there was no such personage The letter to Parker and Perry was dated at Bayou Boeuf At this place therefore the conclusion was I must be sought But here a difficulty suggested itself of a very grave character indeed Bayou Boeuf at its nearest point was twenty three miles distant and was the name applied to the section of country extending between fifty and a hundred miles on both sides of that stream Thousands and thousands of slaves resided upon its shores the remarkable richness and fertility of the soil having attracted thither a great number of planters The information in the letter was so vague and indefinite as to render it difficult to conclude upon any specific course of proceeding It was finally determined however as the only plan that presented any prospect of success that Northup and the brother of Waddill a student in the office of the latter should repair to the Bayou and traveling up one side and down the other its whole length inquire at each plantation for me Mr Waddill tendered the use of his carriage and it was definitely arranged that they should start upon the excursion early Monday morning It will be seen at once that this course in all probability would have resulted unsuccessfully It would have been impossible for them to have gone into the fields and examine all the gangs at work They were not aware that I was known only as Platt and had they inquired of Epps himself he would have stated truly that he knew nothing of Solomon Northup The arrangement being adopted however there was nothing further to be done until Sunday had elapsed The conversation between Messrs Northup and Waddill in the course of the afternoon turned upon New York politics I can scarcely comprehend the nice distinctions and shades of political parties in your State observed Mr Waddill I read of soft shells and hard shells hunkers and barnburners woolly heads and silver grays and am unable to understand the precise difference between them Pray what is it Mr Northup re filling his pipe entered into quite an elaborate narrative of the origin of the various reactions of parties and concluded by saying there was another party in New York known as free soilers or abolitionists You have seen none of those in this part of the country I presume Mr Northup remarked Never but one answered Waddill laughingly We have one here in Marksville an eccentric creature who preaches abolitionism as vehemently as any fanatic at the North He is a generous inoffensive man but always maintaining the wrong side of an argument It affords us a deal of amusement He is an excellent mechanic and almost indispensable in this community He is a carpenter His name is Bass Some further good natured conversation was had at the expense of Bass' peculiarities when Waddill all at once fell into a reflective mood and asked for the mysterious letter again Let me see l e t m e s e e he repeated thoughtfully to himself running his eyes over the letter once more 'Bayou Boeuf August ' August post marked here 'He that is writing for me ' Where did Bass work last summer he inquired turning suddenly to his brother His brother was unable to inform him but rising left the office and soon returned with the intelligence that Bass worked last summer somewhere on Bayou Boeuf He is the man 'bringing down his hand emphatically on the table ' who can tell us all about Solomon Northup exclaimed Waddill Bass was immediately searched for but could not be found After some inquiry it was ascertained he was at the landing on Red River Procuring a conveyance young Waddill and Northup were not long in traversing the few miles to the latter place On their arrival Bass was found just on the point of leaving to be absent a fortnight or more After an introduction Northup begged the privilege of speaking to him privately a moment They walked together towards the river when the following conversation ensued Mr Bass said Northup allow me to ask you if you were on Bayou Boeuf last August Yes sir I was there in August was the reply Did you write a letter for a colored man as that place to some gentleman in Saratoga Springs Excuse me sir if I say that is none of your business answered Bass stopping and looking his interrogator searchingly in the face Perhaps I am rather hasty Mr Bass I beg your pardon but I have come from the State of New York to accomplish the purpose the writer of a letter dated the th of August post marked at Marksville had in view Circumstances have led me to think that you are perhaps the man who wrote it I am in search of Solomon Northup If you know him I beg you to inform me frankly where he is and I assure you the source of any information you may give me shall not be divulged if you desire it not to be A long time Bass looked his new acquaintance steadily in the eyes without opening his lips He seemed to be doubting in his own mind if there was not an attempt to practice some deception upon him Finally he said deliberately I have done nothing to be ashamed of I am the man who wrote the letter If you have come to rescue Solomon Northup I am glad to see you When did you last see him and where is he Northup inquired I last saw him Christmas a week ago to day He is the slave of Edwin Epps a planter on Bayou Boeuf near Holmesville He is not known as Solomon Northup he is called Platt The secret was out the mystery was unraveled Through the thick black cloud amid whose dark and dismal shadows I had walked twelve years broke the star that was to light me back to liberty All mistrust and hesitation were soon thrown aside and the two men conversed long and freely upon the subject uppermost in their thoughts Bass expressed the interest he had taken in my behalf his intention of going north in the Spring and declaring that he had resolved to accomplish my emancipation if it were in his power He described the commencement and progress of his acquaintance with me and listened with eager curiosity to the account given him of my family and the history of my early life Before separating he drew a map of the bayou on a strip of paper with a piece of red chalk showing the locality of Epps' plantation and the road leading most directly to it Northup and his young companion returned to Marksville where it was determined to commence legal proceedings to test the question of my right to freedom I was made plaintiff Mr Northup acting as my guardian and Edwin Epps defendant The process to be issued was in the nature of replevin directed to the sheriff of the parish commanding him to take me into custody and detain me until the decision of the court By the time the papers were duly drawn up it was twelve o'clock at night too late to obtain the necessary signature of the Judge who resided some distance out of town Further business was therefore suspended until Monday morning Everything apparently was moving along swimmingly until Sunday afternoon when Waddill called at Northup's room to express his apprehension of difficulties they had not expected to encounter Bass had become alarmed and had placed his affairs in the hands of a person at the landing communicating to him his intention of leaving the State This person had betrayed the confidence reposed in him to a certain extent and a rumor began to float about the town that the stranger at the hotel who had been observed in the company of lawyer Waddill was after one of old Epps slaves over on the bayou Epps was known at Marksville having frequent occasion to visit that place during the session of the courts and the fear entertained by Mr Northup's adviser was that intelligence would be conveyed to him in the night giving him an opportunity of secreting me before the arrival of the sheriff This apprehension had the effect of expediting matters considerably The sheriff who lived in one direction from the village was requested to hold himself in readiness immediately after midnight while the Judge was informed he would be called upon at the same time It is but justice to say that the authorities at Marksville cheerfully rendered all the assistance in their power As soon after midnight as bail could be perfected and the Judge's signature obtained a carriage containing Mr Northup and the sheriff driven by the landlord's son rolled rapidly out of the village of Marksville on the road towards Bayou Boeuf It was supposed that Epps would contest the issue involving my right to liberty and it therefore suggested itself to Mr Northup that the testimony of the sheriff describing my first meeting with the former might perhaps become material on the trial It was accordingly arranged during the ride that before I had an opportunity of speaking to Mr Northup the sheriff should propound to me certain questions agreed upon such as the number and names of my children the name of my wife before marriage of places I knew at the North and so forth If my answers corresponded with the statements given him the evidence must necessarily be considered conclusive At length shortly after Epps had left the field with the consoling assurance that he would soon return and warm us as was stated in the conclusion of the preceding they came in sight of the plantation and discovered us at work Alighting from the carriage and directing the driver to proceed to the great house with instructions not to mention to any one the object of their errand until they met again Northup and the sheriff turned from the highway and came towards us across the cotton field We observed them on looking up at the carriage one several rods in advance of the other It was a singular and unusual thing to see white men approaching us in that manner and especially at that early hour in the morning and Uncle Abram and Patsey made some remarks expressive of their astonishment Walking up to Bob the sheriff inquired Where's the boy they call Platt Thar he is massa answered Bob pointing to me and twitching off his hat I wondered to myself what business he could possibly have with me and turning round gazed at him until he had approached within a step During my long residence on the bayou I had become familiar with the face of every planter within many miles but this man was an utter stranger certainly I had never seen him before Your name is Platt is it he asked Yes master I responded Pointing towards Northup standing a few rods distant he demanded Do you know that man I looked in the direction indicated and as my eyes rested on his countenance a world of images thronged my brain a multitude of well known faces Anne's and the dear children's and my old dead father's all the scenes and associations of childhood and youth all the friends of other and happier days appeared and disappeared flitting and floating like dissolving shadows before the vision of my imagination until at last the perfect memory of the man recurred to me and throwing up my hands towards Heaven I exclaimed in a voice louder than I could utter in a less exciting moment Henry B Northup Thank God thank God In an instant I comprehended the nature of his business and felt that the hour of my deliverance was at hand I started towards him but the sheriff stepped before me Stop a moment said he have you any other name than Platt Solomon Northup is my name master I replied Have you a family he inquired I had a wife and three children What were your children's names Elizabeth Margaret and Alonzo And your wife's name before her marriage Anne Hampton Who married you Timothy Eddy of Fort Edward Where does that gentleman live again pointing to Northup who remained standing in the same place where I had first recognized him He lives in Sandy Hill Washington county New York was the reply He was proceeding to ask further questions but I pushed past him unable longer to restrain myself I seized my old acquaintance by both hands I could not speak I could not refrain from tears Sol he said at length I'm glad to see you I essayed to make some answer but emotion choked all utterance and I was silent The slaves utterly confounded stood gazing upon the scene their open mouths and rolling eyes indicating the utmost wonder and astonishment For ten years I had dwelt among them in the field and in the cabin borne the same hardships partaken the same fare mingled my griefs with theirs participated in the same scanty joys nevertheless not until this hour the last I was to remain among them had the remotest suspicion of my true name or the slightest knowledge of my real history been entertained by any one of them Not a word was spoken for several minutes during which time I clung fast to Northup looking up into his face fearful I should awake and find it all a dream Throw down that sack Northup added finally your cotton picking days are over Come with us to the man you live with I obeyed him and walking between him and the sheriff we moved towards the great house It was not until we had proceeded some distance that I had recovered my voice sufficiently to ask if my family were all living He informed me he had seen Anne Margaret and Elizabeth but a short time previously that Alonzo was also living and all were well My mother however I could never see again As I began to recover in some measure from the sudden and great excitement which so overwhelmed me I grew faint and weak insomuch it was with difficulty I could walk The sheriff took hold of my arm and assisted me or I think I should have fallen As we entered the yard Epps stood by the gate conversing with the driver That young man faithful to his instructions was entirely unable to give him the least information in answer to his repeated inquiries of what was going on By the time we reached him he was almost as much amazed and puzzled as Bob or Uncle Abram Shaking hands with the sheriff and receiving an introduction to Mr Northup he invited them into house ordering me at the same time to bring in some wood It was some time before I succeeded in cutting an armful having somehow unaccountably lost the power of wielding the axe with any manner of precision When I entered with it at last the table was strewn with papers from one of which Northup was reading I was probably longer than necessity required in placing the sticks upon the fire being particular as to the exact position of each individual one of them I heard the words the said Solomon Northup and the deponent further says and free citizen of New York repeated frequently and from these expressions understood that the secret I had so long retained from Master and Mistress Epps was finally developing I lingered as long as prudence permitted and was about leaving the room when Epps inquired Platt do you know this gentleman Yes master I replied I have known him as long as I can remember Where does he live He lives in New York Did you ever live there Yes master born and bred there You was free then Now you d d nigger he exclaimed why did you not tell me that when I bought you Master Epps I answered in a somewhat different tone than the one in which I had been accustomed to address him Master Epps you did not take the trouble to ask me besides I told one of my owners the man that kidnapped me that I was free and was whipped almost to death for it It seems there has been a letter written for you by somebody Now who is it he demanded authoritatively I made no reply I say who wrote that letter he demanded again Perhaps I wrote it myself I said You haven't been to Marksville post office and back before light I know He insisted upon my informing him and I insisted I would not He made many vehement threats against the man whoever he might be and intimated the bloody and savage vengeance he would wreak upon him when he found him out his whole manner and language exhibited a feeling of anger towards the unknown person who had written for me and of fretfulness at the idea of losing so much property Addressing Mr Northup he swore if he had only had an hour's notice of his coming he would have saved him the trouble of taking me back to New York that he would have run me into the swamp or some other place out of the way where all the sheriffs on earth couldn't have found me I walked out into the yard and was entering the kitchen door when something struck me in the back Aunt Phebe emerging from the back door of the great house with a pan of potatoes had thrown one of them with unnecessary violence thereby giving me to understand that she wished to speak to me a moment confidentially Running up to me she whispered in my ear with great earnestness Lor a' mity Platt what d'ye think Dem two men come after ye Heard 'em tell masse you free got wife and tree children back thar whar you come from Goin' wid 'em Fool if ye don't wish I could go and Aunt Phebe ran on in this manner at a rapid rate Presently Mistress Epps made her appearance in the kitchen She said many things to me and wondered why I had not told her who I was She expressed her regret complimenting me by saying she had rather lose any other servant on the plantation Had Patsey that day stood in my place the measure of my mistress' joy would have overflowed Now there was no one left who could mend a chair or a piece of furniture no one who was of any use about the house no one who could play for her on the violin and Mistress Epps was actually affected to tears Epps had called to Bob to bring up his saddle horse The other slaves also overcoming their fear of the penalty had left their work and come to the yard They were standing behind the cabins out of sight of Epps They beckoned me to come to them and with all the eagerness of curiosity excited to the highest pitch conversed with and questioned me If I could repeat the exact words they uttered with the same emphasis if I could paint their several attitudes and the expression of their countenances it would be indeed an interesting picture In their estimation I had suddenly arisen to an immeasurable height had become a being of immense importance The legal papers having been served and arrangements made with Epps to meet them the next day at Marksville Northup and the sheriff entered the carriage to return to the latter place As I was about mounting to the driver's seat the sheriff said I ought to bid Mr and Mrs Epps good bye I ran back to the piazza where they were standing and taking off my hat said Good bye missis Good bye Platt said Mrs Epps kindly Good bye master Ah you d d nigger muttered Epps in a surly malicious tone of voice you needn't feel so cussed tickled you ain't gone yet I'll see about this business at Marksville to morrow I was only a nigger and knew my place but felt as strongly as if I had been a white man that it would have been an inward comfort had I dared to have given him a parting kick On my way back toward the carriage Patsey ran from behind a cabin and threw her arms about my neck Oh Platt she cried tears streaming down her face you're goin' to be free you're goin' way off yonder where we'll neber see ye any more You've saved me a good many whipping Platt I'm glad you're goin' to be free but oh de Lord de Lord what'll become of me I disengaged myself from her and entered the carriage The driver cracked his whip and away we rolled I looked back and saw Patsey with drooping head half reclining on the ground Mrs Epps was on the piazza Uncle Abram and Bob and Wiley and Aunt Phebe stood by the gate gazing after me I waved my hand but the carriage turned a bend of the bayou hiding them from my eyes forever We stopped a moment at Carey's sugar house where a great number of slaves were at work such an establishment being a curiosity to a Northern man Epps dashed by us on horseback at full speed on the way as we learned next day to the Pine Woods to see William Ford who had brought me into the country Tuesday the fourth of January Epps and his counsel the Hon E Taylor Northup Waddill the Judge and sheriff of Avoyelles and myself met in a room in the village of Marksville Mr Northup stated the facts in regard to me and presented his commission and the affidavits accompanying it The sheriff described the scene in the cotton field I was also interrogated at great length Finally Mr Taylor assured his client that he was satisfied and that litigation would not only be expensive but utterly useless In accordance with his advice a paper was drawn up and signed by the proper parties wherein Epps acknowledged he was satisfied of my right to freedom and formally surrendered me to the authorities of New York It was also stipulated that it be entered of record in the recorder's office of Avoyelles Mr Northup and myself immediately hastened to the landing and taking passage on the first steamer that arrived were soon floating down Red River up which with such desponding thoughts I had been borne twelve years before See Appendix C XXII ARRIVAL IN NEW ORLEANS GLIMPSE OF FREEMAN GENOIS THE RECORDER HIS DESCRIPTION OF SOLOMON REACH CHARLESTON INTERRUPTED BY CUSTOM HOUSE OFFICERS PASS THROUGH RICHMOND ARRIVAL IN WASHINGTON BURCH

SCENES PROCEED TO GLENS FALLS MEETING WITH ANNE MARGARET AND ELIZABETH SOLOMON NORTHUP STAUNTON INCIDENTS CONCLUSION As the steamer glided on its way towards New Orleans perhaps I was not happy perhaps there was no difficulty in restraining myself from dancing round the deck perhaps I did not feel grateful to the man who had come so many hundred miles for me perhaps I did not light his pipe and wait and watch his word and run at his slightest bidding If I didn't well no matter We tarried at New Orleans two days During that time I pointed out the locality of Freeman's slave pen and the room in which Ford purchased me We happened to meet Theophilus in the street but I did not think it worth while to renew acquaintance with him From respectable citizens we ascertained he had become a low miserable rowdy a broken down disreputable man We also visited the recorder Mr Genois to whom Senator Soule's letter was directed and found him a man well deserving the wide and honorable reputation that he bears He very generously furnished us with a sort of legal pass over his signature and seal of office and as it contains the recorder's description of my personal appearance it may not be amiss to insert it here The following is a copy State of Louisiana City of New Orleans Recorder's Office Second District To all to whom these presents shall come This is to certify that Henry B Northup Esquire of the county of Washington New York has produced before me due evidence of the freedom of Solomon a mulatto man aged about forty two years five feet seven inches and six lines woolly hair and chestnut eyes who is a native born of the State of New York That the said Northup being about bringing the said Solomon to his native place through the southern routes the civil authorities are requested to let the aforesaid colored man Solomon pass unmolested he demeaning well and properly Given under my hand and the seal of the city of New Orleans this th January L S TH GENOIS Recorder On the th we came to Lake Pontchartrain by railroad and in due time following the usual route reached Charleston After going on board the steamboat and paying our passage at this city Mr Northup was called upon by a custom house officer to explain why he had not registered his servant He replied that he had no servant that as the agent of New York he was accompanying a free citizen of that State from slavery to freedom and did not desire nor intend to make any registry whatever I conceived from his conversation and manner though I may perhaps be entirely mistaken that no great pains would be taken to avoid whatever difficulty the Charleston officials might deem proper to create At length however we were permitted to proceed and passing through Richmond where I caught a glimpse of Goodin's pen arrived in Washington January th We ascertained that both Burch and Radburn were still residing in that city Immediately a complaint was entered with a police magistrate of Washington against James H Burch for kidnapping and selling me into slavery He was arrested upon a warrant issued by Justice Goddard and returned before Justice Mansel and held to bail in the sum of three thousand dollars When first arrested Burch was much excited exhibiting the utmost fear and alarm and before reaching the justice's office on Louisiana Avenue and before knowing the precise nature of the complaint begged the police to permit him to consult Benjamin O Shekels a slave trader of seventeen years standing and his former partner The latter became his bail At ten o'clock the th of January both parties appeared before the magistrate Senator Chase of Ohio Hon Orville Clark of Sandy Hill and Mr Northup acted as counsel for the prosecution and Joseph H Bradley for the defence Gen Orville Clark was called and sworn as a witness and testified that he had known me from childhood and that I was a free man as was my father before me Mr Northup then testified to the same and proved the facts connected with his mission to Avoyelles Ebenezer Radburn was then sworn for the prosecution and testified he was forty eight years old that he was a resident of Washington and had known Burch fourteen years that in he was keeper of Williams' slave pen that he remembered the fact of my confinement in the pen that year At this point it was admitted by the defendant's counsel that I had been placed in the pen by Burch in the spring of and hereupon the prosecution rested Benjamin O Shekels was then offered as a witness by the prisoner Benjamin is a large coarse featured man and the reader may perhaps get a somewhat correct conception of him by reading the exact language he used in answer to the first question of defendant's lawyer He was asked the place of his nativity and his reply uttered in a sort of rowdyish way was in these very words I was born in Ontario county New York and weighed fourteen pounds Benjamin was a prodigious baby He further testified that he kept the Steamboat Hotel in Washington in and saw me there in the spring of that year He was proceeding to state what he had heard two men say when Senator Chase raised a legal objection to wit that the sayings of third persons being hearsay was improper evidence The objection was overruled by the Justice and Shekels continued stating that two men came to his hotel and represented they had a colored man for sale that they had an interview with Burch that they stated they came from Georgia but he did not remember the county that they gave a full history of the boy saying he was a bricklayer and played on the violin that Burch remarked he would purchase if they could agree that they went out and brought the boy in and that I was the same person He further testified with as much unconcern as if it was the truth that I represented I was born and bred in Georgia that one of the young men with me was my master that I exhibited a great deal of regret at parting with him and he believed got into tears nevertheless that I insisted my master had a right to sell me that he ought to sell me and the remarkable reason I gave was according to Shekels because he my master had been gambling and on a spree He continued in these words copied from the minutes taken on the examination Burch interrogated the boy in the usual manner told him if he purchased him he should send him south The boy said he had no objection that in fact he would like to go south Burch paid for him to my knowledge I don't know what name was given him but think it was not Solomon Did not know the name of either of the two men They were in my tavern two or three hours during which time the boy played on the violin The bill of sale was signed in my bar room It was a printed blank filled up by Burch Before Burch was my partner Our business was buying and selling slaves After that time he was a partner of Theophilus Freeman of New Orleans Burch bought here Freeman sold there Shekels before testifying had heard my relation of the circumstances connected with the visit to Washington with Brown and Hamilton and therefore it was undoubtedly he spoke of two men and of my playing on the violin Such was his fabrication utterly untrue and yet there was found in Washington a man who endeavored to corroborate him Benjamin A Thorn testified he was at Shekels' in and saw a colored boy playing on a fiddle Shekels said he was for sale Heard his master tell him he should sell him The boy acknowledged to me he was a slave I was not present when the money was paid Will not swear positively this is the boy The master came near shedding tears I think the boy did I have been engaged in the business of taking slaves south off and on for twenty years When I can't do that I do something else I was then offered as a witness but objection being made the court decided my evidence inadmissible It was rejected solely on the ground that I was a colored man the fact of my being a free citizen of New York not being disputed Shekels having testified there was a bill of sale executed Burch was called upon by the prosecution to produce it inasmuch as such a paper would corroborate the testimony of Thorn and Shekels The prisoner's counsel saw the necessity of exhibiting it or giving some reasonable explanation for its non production To effect the latter Burch himself was offer as a witness in his own behalf It was contended by counsel for the people that such testimony should not be allowed that it was in contravention of every rule of evidence and if permitted would defeat the ends of justice His testimony however was received by the court He made oath that such a bill of sale had been drawn up and signed but he had lost it and did not know what had become of it Thereupon the magistrate was requested to dispatch a police officer to Burch's residence with directions to bring his books containing his bills of sales for the year The request was granted and before any measure could be taken to prevent it the officer had obtained possession of the books and brought them into court The sales for the year were found and carefully examined but no sale of myself by any name was discovered Upon this testimony the court held the fact to be established that Burch came innocently and honestly by me and accordingly he was discharged An attempt was then made by Burch and his satellites to fasten upon me the charge that I had conspired with the two white men to defraud him with what success appears in an extract taken from an article in the New York Times published a day or two subsequent to the trial The counsel for the defendant had drawn up before the defendant was discharged an affidavit signed by Burch and had a warrant out against the colored man for a conspiracy with the two white men before referred to to defraud Burch out of six hundred and twenty five dollars The warrant was served and the colored man arrested and brought before officer Goddard Burch and his witnesses appeared in court and H B Northup appeared as counsel for the colored man stating he was ready to proceed as counsel on the part of the defendant and asking no delay whatever Burch after consulting privately a short time with Shekels stated to the magistrate that he wished him to dismiss the complaint as he would not proceed farther with it Defendant's counsel stated to the magistrate that if the complaint was withdrawn it must be without the request or consent of the defendant Burch then asked the magistrate to let him have the complaint and the warrant and he took them The counsel for the defendant objected to his receiving them and insisted they should remain as part of the records of the court and that the court should endorse the proceedings which had been had under the process Burch delivered them up and the court rendered a judgement of discontinuance by the request of the prosecutor and filed it in his office There may be those who will affect to believe the statement of the slave trader those in whose minds his allegations will weigh heavier than mine I am a poor colored man one of a down trodden and degraded race whose humble voice may not be heeded by the oppressor but knowing the truth and with a full sense of my accountability I do solemnly declare before men and before God that any charge or assertion that I conspired directly or indirectly with any person or persons to sell myself that any other account of my visit to Washington my capture and imprisonment in Williams slave pen shall is contained in these s is utterly and absolutely false I never played on the violin in Washington I never was in the Steamboat Hotel and never saw Thorn or Shekels to my knowledge in my life until last January The story of the trio of slave traders is a fabrication as absurd as it is base and unfounded Were it true I should not have turned aside on my way back to liberty for the purpose of prosecuting Burch I should have avoided rather than sought him I should have known that such a step would have resulted in rendering me infamous Under the circumstances longing as I did to behold my family and elated with the prospect of returning home it is an outrage upon probability to suppose I would have run the hazard not only of exposure but of a criminal prosecution and conviction by voluntarily placing myself in the position I did if the statements of Burch and his confederates contain a particle of truth I took pains to seek him out to confront him in a court of law charging him with the crime of kidnapping and the only motive that impelled me to this step was a burning sense of the wrong he had inflicted upon me and a desire to bring him to justice He was acquitted in the manner and by such means as have been described A human tribunal has permitted him to escape but there is another and a higher tribunal where false testimony will not prevail and where I am willing so far at least as these statements are concerned to be judged at last We left Washington on the th of January and proceeding by the way of Philadelphia New York and Albany reached Sandy Hill in the night of the st My heart overflowed with happiness as I looked around upon old familiar scenes and found myself in the midst of friends of other days The following morning I started in company with several acquaintances for Glens Falls the residence of Anne and our children As I entered their comfortable cottage Margaret was the first that met me She did not recognize me When I left her she was but seven years old a little prattling girl playing with her toys Now she was grown to womanhood was married with a bright eyed boy standing by her side Not forgetful of his enslaved unfortunate grand father she had named the child Solomon Northup Staunton When told who I was she was overcome with emotion and unable to speak Presently Elizabeth entered the room and Anne came running from the hotel having been informed of my arrival They embraced me and with tears flowing down their cheeks hung upon my neck But I draw a veil over a scene which can better be imagined than described When the violence of our emotions had subsided to a sacred joy when the household gathered round the fire that sent out its warm and crackling comfort through the room we conversed of the thousand events that had occurred the hopes and fears the joys and sorrows the trials and troubles we had each experienced during the long separation Alonzo was absent in the western part of the State The boy had written to his mother a short time previous of the prospect of his obtaining sufficient money to purchase my freedom From his earliest years that had been the chief object of his thoughts and his ambition They knew I was in bondage The letter written on board the brig and Clem Ray himself had given them that information But where I was until the arrival of Bass' letter was a matter of conjecture Elizabeth and Margaret once returned from school so Anne informed me weeping bitterly On inquiring the cause of the children's sorrow it was found that while studying geography their attention had been attracted to the picture of slaves working in the cotton field and an overseer following them with his whip It reminded them of the sufferings father might be and as it happened actually was enduring in the South Numerous incidents such as these were related incidents showing they still held me in constant remembrance but not perhaps of sufficient interest to the reader to be recounted My narrative is at an end I have no comments to make upon the subject of Slavery Those who read this book may form their own opinions of the peculiar institution What it may be in other States I do not profess to know what it is in the region of Red River is truly and faithfully delineated in these s This is no fiction no exaggeration If I have failed in anything it has been in presenting to the reader too prominently the bright side of the picture I doubt not hundreds have been as unfortunate as myself that hundreds of free citizens have been kidnapped and sold into slavery and are at this moment wearing out their lives on plantations in Texas and Louisiana But I forbear Chastened and subdued in spirit by the sufferings I have borne and thankful to that good Being through whose mercy I have been restored to happiness and liberty I hope henceforward to lead an upright though lowly life and rest at last in the church yard where my father sleeps ROARING RIVER A REFRAIN OF THE RED RIVER PLANTATION Harper's creek and roarin' ribber Thar

Henry-Bibb,NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF HENRY BIBB AN AMERICAN SLAVE WRITTEN BY HIMSELF WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY LUCIUS C MATLACK NEW YORK PUBLISHED BY THE AUTHOR SPRUCE STREET verso Entered according to the Act of Congress in the year By HENRY BIBB In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the Southern District of New York MACDONALD LEE PRINTERS SPRUCE STREET N Y i INTRODUCTION FROM the most obnoxious substances we often see spring forth beautiful and fragrant flowers of every hue to regale the eye and perfume the air Thus frequently are results originated which are wholly unlike the cause that gave them birth An illustration of this truth is afforded by the history of American Slavery Naturally and necessarily the enemy of literature it has come the prolific theme of much that is profound in argument sublime in poetry and thrilling in narrative From the soil of slavery itself have sprang forth some of the most brilliant productions whose logical levers will ultimately upheave and overthrow the system Gushing fountains of poetic thought have started from beneath the rod of violence that will long continue to slake the feverish thirst of humanity outraged until swelling to a flood it shall rush with wasting violence over the ill gotten heritage of the oppressor Startling incidents authenticated far excelling fiction in their touching pathos from the pen of self emancipated slaves do now exhibit slavery in such revolting aspects as to secure the execrations of all good men and become a monument more enduring than marble in testimony strong as sacred writ against it Of the class last named is the narrative of the life of Henry Bibb which is equally distinguished as a revolting portrait of the hideous slave system a thrilling narrative of individual suffering and a triumphant vindication of the slave's manhood and mental dignity And all this is associated with unmistakable traces of originality and truthfulness To many the elevated style purity of diction and easy flow of language frequently exhibited will appear unaccountable and contradictory in view of his want of early mental culture ii But to the thousands who have listened with delight to his speeches on anniversary and other occasions these same traits will be noted as unequivocal evidence of originality Very few men present in their written composition so perfect a transcript of their style as is exhibited by Mr Bibb Moreover the writer of this introduction is well acquainted with his handwriting and style The entire manuscript I have examined and prepared for the press Many of the closing s of it were written by Mr Bibb in my office And the whole is preserved for inspection now An examination of it will show that no alteration of sentiment language or style was necessary to make it what it now is in the hands of the reader The work of preparation for the press was that of orthography and punctuation merely an arrangement of the s and a table of contents little more than falls to the lot of publishers generally The fidelity of the narrative is sustained by the most satisfactory and ample testimony Time has proved its claims to truth Thorough investigation has sifted and analysed every essential fact alleged and demonstrated clearly that this thrilling and eloquent narrative though stranger than fiction is undoubtedly true It is only necessary to present the following documents to the reader to sustain this declaration For convenience of reference and that they may be more easily understood the letters will be inserted consecutively with explanations following the last The best preface to these letters is the report of a committee appointed to investigate the truth of Mr Bibb's narrative as he has delivered it in public for years past REPORT OF THE UNDERSIGNED COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE DETROIT LIBERTY ASSOCIATION TO INVESTIGATE THE TRUTH OF THE NARRATIVE OF HENRY BIBB A FUGITIVE FROM SLAVERY AND REPORT THEREON Mr Bibb has addressed several assemblies in Michigan and his narrative is generally known Some of his hearers among whom were Liberty men felt doubt as to the truth of his statements Respect for their scruples and the obligation of duty iii to the public induced the formation of the present Committee The Committee entered on the duty confided to them resolved on a searching scrutiny and all unreserved publication of its result Mr Bibb acquiesced in the inquiry with a praiseworthy spirit He attended before the Committee and gave willing aid to its object He was subjected to a rigorous examination Facts dates persons and localities were demanded and cheerfully furnished Proper inquiry either by letter or personally or through the medium of friends was then made from every person and in every quarter likely to elucidate the truth In fact no test for its ascertainment known to the sense or experience of the Committee was omitted The result was the collection of a large body of testimony from very diversified quarters Slave owners slave dealers fugitives from slavery political friends and political foes contributed to a mass of testimony every part of which pointed to a common conclusions the undoubted truth of Mr Bibb's statements In the Committee's opinion no individual can substantiate the events of his life by testimony more conclusive and harmonious than is now before them in confirmation of Mr Bibb The main facts of his narrative and many of the minor ones are corroborated beyond all question No inconsistency has been disclosed nor anything revealed to create suspicion The Committee have no hesitation in declaring their conviction that Mr Bibb is amply sustained and is entitled to public confidence and high esteem The bulk of testimony precludes its publication but it is in the Committee's hands for the inspection of any applicant A L PORTER C H STEWART SILAS M HOLMES Committee DETROIT April From the bulk of testimony obtained a part only is here introduced The remainder fully corroborates and strengthens that No An Extract DAWN MILLS FEB th CHARLES H STEWART ESQ MY DEAR BROTHER Your kind communication of the th came to hand yesterday I have made inquiries respecting Henry Bibb which may be of service to you Mr Wm Harrison to whom you allude in your letter is here He is a respectable and worthy man a man of piety I have just had in interview with him this evening He testifies that he was well acquainted with Henry Bibb in Trimble County Ky and that he sent a letter to him by Thomas Henson and got one in return from him He says that Bibb came out to Canada some three years ago and went back to get his wife up but was betrayed at Cincinnati by a colored man that he was taken to Louisville but got away iv was taken again and lodged in jail and sold off to New Orleans or he Harrison understood that he was taken to New Orleans He testifies that Bibb is a Methodist man and says that two persons who came on with him last Summer knew Bibb One of these Simpson Young is now at Malden Very respectfully thy friend HIRAM WILSON No BEDFORD TRIMBLE CO KENTUCKY March SIR Your letter under date of the th ult is now before me making some inquiry about a person supposed to be a fugitive from the South who is lecturing to your religious community on Slavery and the South I am pleased to inform you that I have it in my power to give you the information you desire The person spoken of by you I have no doubt is Walton yellow man who once belonged to my father William Gatewood He was purchased by him from John Sibly and by John Sibly of his brother Albert G Sibly and Albert G Sibly became possessed of him by his marriage with Judge David White's daughter he being born Judge White's slave The boy Walton at the time he belonged to John Sibly married a slave of my father's a mulatto girl and sometime afterwards solicited him to buy him the old man after much importuning from Walton consented to do so and accordingly paid Sibly eight hundred and fifty dollars He did not buy him because he needed him but from the fact that he had a wife there and Walton on his part promising every thing that my father could desire It was not long however before Walton became indolent and neglectful of his duty and in addition to this he was guilty as the old man thought of worse offences He watched his conduct more strictly and found he was guilty of disposing of articles from the farm and pocketing the money He actually caught him one day stealing wheat he had conveyed one sack full to a neighbor and whilst he was delivering the other my father caught him in the very act He confessed his guilt and promised to do better for the future and on his making promises of this kind my father was disposed to keep him still not wishing to part him from his wife for whom he professed to entertain the strongest of affection When the Christmas holidays came on the old man as usual in this country gave his negroes a week Holiday Walton instead of regaling himself by going about visiting colored friends took up his line of march for her Britanic Majesty's dominions He was gone about two years I think when I heard of him v in Cincinnati I repaired thither with some few friends to aid me and succeeded in securing him He was taken to Louisville and on the next morning after our arrival there he escaped almost from before our face while we were on the street before the Tavern He succeeded in eluding our pursuit and again reached Canada in safety Nothing daunted he returned after a lapse of some twelve or eighteen months with the intention as I have since learned of conducting off his wife and eight or ten more slaves to Canada I got news of his whereabouts and succeeded in recapturing him I took him to Louisville and together with his wife and child she going along with him at her owner's request sold hem He was taken from thence to New Orleans and from hence to Red River Arkansas and the next news I had of him he was again wending his way to Canada and I suppose now is at or near Detroit In relation to his character it was the general opinion here that he was a notorious liar and a rogue These things I can procure any number of respectable witnesses to prove In proof of it he says his mother belonged to James Bibb which is a lie there not having been such a man about here much less brother of Secretary Bibb He says that Bibb's daughter married A G Sibly when the fact is Sibly married Judge David White's daughter and his mother belonged to White also an is now here free So you will perceive he is guilty of lying for no effect and what might it not be supposed he would do where he could effect anything by it I have been more tedious than I should have been but being anxious to give you his rascally conduct in full must be my apology You are at liberty to publish this letter or make any use you see proper of it If you do publish it let me have a paper containing the publication at any rate let me hear from you again Respectfully yours c SILAS GATEWOOD To C H STEWART Esq No An Extract CINCINNATI March MY DEAR SIR Mrs Path Nickens and Woodson did not see Bibb on his first visit in when he staid with Job Dundy but were subsequently told of it by Bibb They first saw him in May Mrs Path remembers this date because it was the month in which she removed from Broadway to Harrison street and Bibb assisted her to remove Mrs Path's garden adjoined Dundy's back yard While engaged in digging up flowers she was addressed by Bibb who was staying with Dundy and who offered to dig them up for her She hired vi him to do it Mrs Dundy shortly after called over and told Mrs Path that he was a slave After that Mrs Path took him into her house and concealed him While concealed he astonished his good protectress by his ingenuity in bottoming chairs with cane When the furniture was removed Bibb insisted on helping and was after some remonstrances permitted At the house on Harrison Street he was employed for several days in digging a cellar and was so employed when seized on Saturday afternoon by the constables He held frequent conversations with Mrs Path and others in which he gave them the same account which he has given you On Saturday afternoon two noted slave catching constables E V Brooks and O'Neill surprised Bibb as he was digging in the cellar Bibb sprang for the fence and gained the top of it where he was seized and dragged back They took him immediately before William Doty a Justice of infamous notoriety as an accomplice of kidnappers proved property paid charges and took him away His distressed friends were surprised by his re appearance in a few days after the Wednesday following as they think He reached the house of Dr Woods a colored since Deceased before day break and staid until dusk Mrs Path John Woodson and others made up about twelve dollars for him Woodson accompanied him out of town a mile and bid him God Speed He has never been here since Woodson and Clark saw him at Detroit two years ago Yours truly WILLIAM BIRNEY No LOUISVILLE March MR STEWART Yours of the st came to hand on the th inst You wished me to inform you what became of a boy that was in the work house in the fall of ' The boy you allude to went by the name of Walton he had ran away from Kentucky some time before and returned for his wife was caught and sold to Garrison he was taken to Louisiana I think he was sold on Red River to a planter As Garrison is absent in the City of New Orleans at this time I cannot inform you who he was sold to Garrison will be in Louisville some time this Spring if you wish me I will inquire of Garrison and inform you to whom he was sold and where his master lives at this time Yours W PORTER No BEDFORD TRIMBLE COUNTY KY C H STEWART Esq SIR I received your note on the th inst and in accordance with it I write you these lines You stated that you would vii wish to know something about Walton H Bibb and whether he had a wife and child and whether they were sold to New Orleans Sir before I answer these inquiries I should like to know who Charles H Stewart is and why you should make these inquiries of me and how you knew who I was as you are a stranger to me and I must be to you In your next if you will tell me the intention of your inquiries I will give you a full history of the whole case I have a boy in your county by the name of King a large man and very black if you are acquainted with him give him my compliments an tell him I am well and all of his friends W H Bibb is acquainted with him I wait your answer Your most obedient W H GATEWOOD March No BEDFORD KENTUCKY April th MR CHARLES H STEWART SIR Yours of the st March is before me inquiring if one Walton Bibb a colored man escaped from me at Louisville Ky in the Spring of To that inquiry I answer he did The particulars are these He ran off from William Gatewood some time in I think and was heard of in Cincinnati Myself and some others went there and took him and took him to Louisville for sale by the directions of his master While there he made his escape and was gone some time I think about one year or longer He came back it was said to get his wife and child so report says He was again taken by his owner he together with his wife and child was taken to Louisville and sold to a man who traded in negroes and was taken by him to New Orleans and sold with his wife and child to some man up Red River so I was informed by the man who sold him He then ran off and left his wife and child and got back it seems to your Country I can say for Gatewood he was a good master and treated him well Gatewood bought him from a Mr Sibly who was going to send him down the river Walton to my knowledge influenced Gatewood to buy him and promised if he would never to disobey him or run off Who he belongs to now I do not know I know Gatewood sold his wife and child at a great sacrifice to satisfy him If any other information is necessary I will give it if required You will please write me again what he is trying to do in your country or what he wishes the inquiry from me for Yours truly DANIEL S LANE These letters need little comment Their testimony combined is most harmonious and conclusive Look at the points established viii Hiram Wilson gives the testimony of reputable men now in Canada who knew Henry Bibb as a slave in Kentucky Silas Gatewood with a peculiar relish fills three s of foolscap being anxious to give his rascally conduct in full as he says But he vaults over the saddle and lands on the other side His testimony is invaluable as an endorsement of Mr Bibb's truthfulness He illustrates all the essential facts of this narrative He also labors to prove him deceitful and a liar Deceit in a slave is only a slight reflex of the stupendous fraud practised by his master And its indulgence has far more logic in its favor than the ablest plea ever written for slave holding under ever such peculiar circumstances The attempt to prove Mr Bibb in the lie is a signal failure as he never affirmed what Gatewood denies With this offset the letter under notice is a triumphant vindication of one whom he thought thereby to injure sadly As Mr Bibb has most happily acknowledged the wheat see I pass the charge of stealing by referring to the logic there need which will be convincing William Birney Esq attests the facts of Mr Bibb's arrest in Cincinnati and the subsequent escape as narrated by him from the declaration of eye witnesses W Porter Jailor states that Bibb was in the work house at Louisville held and sold afterwards to the persons and at the places named in this volume W H Gatewood with much Southern dignity will answer no questions but show his relation to these matters by naming King saying W H Bibb is acquainted with him and promising a full history of the case Daniel S Lane with remarkable straight forwardness and stupidity tells all he knows and then wants to know what they ask him for The writer will answer that question He wanted to prove by two or more witnesses the truth of his own statements which has most surely been accomplished Having thus presented an array of testimony sustaining the alleged in this narrative the introduction will be concluded by introducing a letter signed by respectable men of ix Detroit and endorsed by Judge Wilkins showing the high esteem in which Mr Bibb is held by those who know him well where he makes his home Their testimony expresses their present regard as well as an opinion of his past character It is introduced here with the greatest satisfaction as the writer is assured from an intimate acquaintance with Henry Bibb that all who know him hereafter will entertain the same sentiment toward him DETROIT March The undersigned have pleasure in recommending Henry Bibb to the kindness and confidence of Anti slavery friends in every State He has resided among us for some years His deportment his conduct and his christian course have won our esteem and affection The narrative of his sufferings and more early life has been thoroughly investigated by a Committee appointed for the purpose They sought evidence respecting it in every proper quarter and their report attested its undoubted truth In this conclusion we all cordially unite H Bibb has for some years publicly made this narrative to assemblies whose number cannot be told it has commanded public attention in this State and provoked inquiry Occasionally too we see persons from the South who knew him in early years yet not a word or fact worthy of impairing its truth has reached us but on the contrary every thing tended to its corroboration Mr Bibb's Anti slavery efforts in this State have produced incalculable benefit The Lord has blessed him into an instrument of great power He has labored much and for very inadequate compensation Lucrative offers for other quarters did not tempt him to a more profitable field His sincerity and disinterestedness are therefore beyond suspicion We bid him God speed on his route We bespeak for him every kind consideration H HALLOCK President of the Detroit Lib Association CULLEN BROWN Vice President S M HOLMES Secretary J D BALDWIN CHARLES H STEWART MARTIN WILSON WILLIAM BARNUM DETROIT Nov The undersigned cheerfully concurs with Mr Hallock and others in their friendly recommendation of Mr Henry Bibb x The undersigned has known him for many months in the Sabbath School in this City partly under his charge and can Certify to his correct deportment and commend him to the Sympathies of Christian benevolence ROSS WILSON The task now performed in preparing for the press and introducing to the public the narrative of Henry Bibb has been one of the most pleasant ever required at my hands And I conclude it with an expression of the hope that it may afford interest to the reader support to the author in his efforts against slavery and be instrumental advancing the great work of emancipation in this country LUCIUS C MATLACK New York City July st xi AUTHOR'S PREFACE This work has been written during irregular intervals while I have been travelling and laboring for the emancipation of my enslaved countrymen The reader will remember that I make no pretension to literature for I can truly say that I have been educated in the school of adversity whips and chains Experience and observation have been my principal teachers with the exception of three weeks schooling which I have had the good fortune to receive since my escape from the grave yard of the mind or the dark prison of human bondage And nothing but untiring perseverance has enabled me to prepare this volume for the public eye and I trust by the aid of Divine Providence to be able to make it intelligible and instructive I thank God for the blessings of Liberty the contrast is truly great between freedom and slavery To be changed from a chattel to a human being is no light matter though the process with myself practically was very simple And if I could reach the ears of every slave to day throughout the whole continent of America I would teach the same lesson I would sound it in the ears of every hereditary bondman break your chains and fly for freedom It may be asked why I have written this work when there has been so much already written and published of the same character from other fugitives And why publish it after having told it publicly all through New England and the Western States to multiplied thousands My answer is that in no place have I given orally the detail of my narrative and some of the most interesting events of my life have never reached the public ear Moreover it was xii at the request of many friends of lowtrodden humanity that I have undertaken to write the following sketch that light and truth might be spread on the sin and evils of slavery as far as possible I also wanted to leave my humble testimony on record against this man destroying system to be read by succeeding generations when my body shall lie mouldering in the dust But I would not attempt by any sophistry to misrepresent slavery in order to prove its dreadful wickedness For I presume there are none who may read this narrative through whether Christians or slaveholders males or females but what will admit it to be a system of the most high handed oppression and tyranny that ever was tolerated by an enlightened nation HENRY BIBB xiii INDEX INTRODUCTION AUTHOR'S PREFACE CHAP I Sketch of my Parentage Early separation from my Mother Hard Fare First Experiments at

THE PRESS NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF HENRY BIBB I Sketch of my Parentage Early separation from my Mother Hard Fare First Experiments at running away Earnest longing for Freedom Abhorrent nature of Slavery I was born May of a slave mother in Shelby County Kentucky and was claimed as the property of David White Esq He came into possession of my mother long before I was born I was brought up in the Counties of Shelby Henry Oldham and Trimble Or more correctly speaking in the above counties I may safely say I was flogged up for where I should have received moral mental and religious instruction I received stripes without number the object of which was to degrade and keep me in subordination I can truly say that I drank deeply of the bitter cup of suffering and woe I have been dragged down to the lowest depths of human degradation and wretchedness by Slaveholders My mother was known by the name of Milldred Jackson She is the mother of seven slaves only all being sons of whom I am the eldest She was also so fortunate or unfortunate as to have some of what is called the slaveholding blood flowing in her veins I know not how much but not enough to prevent her children though fathered by slaveholders from being bought and sold in the slave markets of the South It is almost impossible for slaves to give a correct account of their male parentage All that I know about it is that my mother informed me that my fathers name was James Bibb He was doubtless one of the present Bibb family of Kentucky but I have no personal knowledge of him at all for he died before my recollection The first time I was separated from my mother I was young and small I knew nothing of my condition then as a slave I was living with Mr White whose wife died and left him a widower with one little girl who was said to be the legitimate owner of my mother and all her children This girl was also my playmate when we were children I was taken away from my mother and hired out to labor for various persons eight or ten years in succession and all my wages were expended for the education of Harriet White my playmate It was then my sorrows and sufferings commenced It was then I first commenced seeing and feeling that I was a wretched slave compelled to work under the lash without wages and often without clothes enough to hide my nakedness I have often worked without half enough to eat both late and early by day and by night I have often laid my wearied limbs down at night to rest upon a dirt floor or a bench without any covering at all be cause I had no where else to rest my wearied body after having worked hard all the day I have also been compelled in early life to go at the bidding of a tyrant through all kinds of weather hot or cold wet or dry and without shoes frequently until the month of December with my bare feet on the cold frosty ground cracked open and bleeding as I walked Reader believe me when I say that no tongue nor pen ever has or can express the horrors of American Slavery Consequently I despair in finding language to express adequately the deep feeling of my soul as I contemplate the past history of my life But although I have suffered much from the lash and for want of food and raiment I confess that it was no disadvantage to be passed through the hands of so many families as the only source of information that I had to enlighten my mind consisted in what I could see and hear from others Slaves were not allowed books pen ink nor paper to improve their minds But it seems to me now that I was particularly observing and apt to retain what came under my observation But more especially all that I heard about liberty and freedom to the slaves I never forgot Among other good trades I learned the art of running away to perfection I made a regular business of it and never gave it up until I had broken the bands of slavery and landed myself safely in Canada where I was regarded as a man and not as a thing The first time in my life that I ran away was for ill treatment in I was living with a Mr Vires in the village of Newcastle His wife was a very cross woman She was every day flogging me boxing pulling my ears and scolding so that I dreaded to enter the room where she was This first started me to running away from them I was often gone several days before I was caught They abuse me for going off but it did no good The next time they flogged me I was off again but after awhile they got sick of their bargain and returned me back into the hands of my owners By this time Mr White had married his second wife She was what I call a tyrant I lived with her several months but she kept me almost half of my time in the woods running from under the bloody lash While I was at home she kept me all the time rubbing furniture washing scrubbing the floors and when I was not doing this she would often seat herself in a large rocking chair with two pillows about her and would make me rock her and keep off the flies She was too lazy to scratch her own head and would often make me scratch and comb it for her She would at other times lie on her bed in warm weather and make me fan her while she slept scratch and rub her feet but after awhile she got sick of me and preferred a maiden servant to do such business I was then hired out again but by this time I had become much better skilled in running away and would make calculation to avoid detection by taking with me a bridle If any body should see me in the woods as they have and asked what are you doing here sir you are a runaway I said no sir I am looking for our old mare at other times looking for our cows For such excuses I was let pass In fact the only weapon of self defence that I could use successfully was that of deception It is useless for a poor helpless slave to resist a white man in a slaveholding State Public opinion and the law is against him and resistance in many cases is death to the slave while the law declares that he shall submit or die The circumstances in which I was then placed gave me a longing desire to be free It kindled a fire of liberty within my breast which has never yet been quenched This seemed to be a part of my nature it was first revealed to me by the inevitable laws of nature's God I could see that the All wise Creator had made man a free moral intelligent and accountable being capable of knowing good and evil And I believed then as I believe now that every man has a right to wages for his labor a right to his own wife and children a right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness and a right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience But here in the light of these truths I was a slave a prisoner for life I could possess nothing nor acquire anything but what must belong to my keeper No one can imagine my feelings in my reflecting moments but he who has himself been a slave Oh I have often wept over my condition while sauntering through the forest to escape cruel punishment No arm to protect me from tyrants aggression No parents to cheer me when laden with grief Man may picture the bands of the rocks and the rivers The hills and the valleys the lakes and the ocean But the horrors of slavery he never can trace The term slave to this day sounds with terror to my soul a word too obnoxious to speak a system too intolerable to be endured I know this from long and sad experience I now feel as if I had just been aroused from sleep and looking back with quickened perception at the state of torment from whence I fled I was there held and claimed as a slave as such I was subjected to the will and power of my keeper in all respects whatsoever That the slave is a human being no one can deny It is his lot to be exposed in common with other men to the calamities of sickness death and the misfortunes incident to life But unlike other men he is denied the consolation of struggling against external difficulties such as destroy the life liberty and happiness of himself and family A slave may be bought and sold in the market like an ox He is be sold off to a distant land from his family He is bound in chains hand and foot and his sufferings are aggravated a hundred fold by the terrible thought that he is not allowed to struggle against misfortune corporeal punishment insults and outrages committed upon himself and family and he is not allowed to help himself to resist or escape the blow which he sees impending over him This idea of utter helplessness in perpetual bondage is the more distressing as there is no period even with the remotest generation when it shall terminate Illustration Illustration II A fruitless effort for education The Sabbath among Slaves Degrading amusements Why religion is rejected Condition of poor white people Superstition among slaves Education forbidden IN I had some very serious religious impressions and there was quite a number of slaves in that neighborhood who felt very desirous to be taught to read the Bible There was a Miss Davis a poor white girl who offered to teach a Sabbath School for the slaves notwithstanding public opinion and the law was opposed to it Books were furnished and she commenced the school but the news soon got to our owners that she was teaching us to read This caused quite an excitement in the neighborhood Patrols Police peculiar to the South were appointed to go and break it up the next Sabbath They were determined that we should not have a Sabbath School in operation For slaves this was called an incendiary Movement The Sabbath is not regarded by a large number of the slaves as a day of rest They have no schools to go to no moral nor religious instruction at all in many localities where there are hundreds of Illustration The Sabbath among Slaves slaves Hence they resort to some kind of amusement Those who make no profession of religion resort to the woods in large numbers on that day to gamble fight get drunk and break the Sabbath This is often encouraged by slaveholders When they wish to have a little sport of that kind they go among the slaves and give them whiskey to see them dance pat juber sing and play on the banjo Then get them to wrestling fighting jumping running foot races and butting each other like sheep This is urged on by giving them whiskey making bets on them laying chips on one slave's head and daring another to tip it off with his hand and if he tipped it off it be called an insult and cause a fight Before fighting the parties choose their seconds to stand by them while fighting a ring or a circle is formed to fight in and no one is allowed to enter the ring while they are fighting but their seconds and the white gentlemen They are not allowed to fight a duel nor to use weapons any kind The blows are made by kicking knocking and butting with their heads they grab each other by their ears and jam their heads together like sheep If they are likely to hurt each other very bad their masters would rap them with their walking canes and make them stop After fighting they make friends shake hands and take a dram together and there is no more of it But this is all principally for want of moral instruction This is where they have no Sabbath Schools no one to read the Bible to them no one to preach the gospel who is competent to expound the Scriptures except slaveholders And the slaves with but few exceptions have no confidence at all in their preaching because they preach a pro slavery doctrine They say Servants be obedient to your masters and he that knoweth his masters will and doeth it not shall be beaten with many stripes means that God will send them to hell if they disobey their masters This kind of preaching has driven thousands into infidelity They view themselves as suffering unjustly under the lash without friends without protection of law or gospel and the green eyed monster tyranny staring them in the face They know that they are destined to die in that wretched condition unless they are delivered by the arm of omnipotence And they cannot believe or trust in such a religion as above named The poor and loafering class of whites are about on a par in point of morals with the slaves at the South They are generally ignorant intemperate licentious and profane They associate much with the slaves are often found gambling together on the Sabbath encouraging slaves to steal from their owners and sell to them corn wheat sheep chickens or any thing of the kind which they can well conceal For such offences there is no law to reach a slave but lynch law But if both parties are caught in the act by a white person the slave is punished with the lash while the white man is often punished with both lynch and common law But there is another class of poor white people in the South who I think would be glad to see slavery abolished in self defence they despise the institution because it is impoverishing and degrading to them and their children The slave holders are generally rich aristocratic overbearing and they look with utter contempt upon a poor laboring man who earns his bread by the sweat of his brow whether he be moral or immoral honest or dishonest No matter whether he is white or black if he performs manual labor for a livelihood he is looked upon as being inferior to a slaveholder and but little better off than the slave who toils without wages under the lash It is true that the slaveholder and non slaveholder are living under the same laws in the same State But the one is rich the other is poor one is educated the other is uneducated one has houses land and influence the other has none This being the case that class of the non slaveholders would be glad to see slavery abolished but they dare not speak it aloud There is much superstition among the slaves Many of them believe in what they call conjuration tricking and witchcraft and some of them pretend to understand the art and say that by it they can prevent their masters from exercising their will over their slaves Such are often applied to by others to give them power to prevent their masters from flogging them The remedy is most generally some kind of bitter root they are directed to chew it and spit towards their masters when they are angry with their slaves At other times they prepare certain kinds of powders to sprinkle about their masters dwellings This is all done for the purpose of defending themselves in some Peaceable manner although I am satisfied that there is no virtue at all in it I have tried it to perfection when I was a slave at the South I was then a young man full of life and vigor and was very fond of visiting our neighbors slaves but had no time to visit only Sundays when I could get a permit to go or after night when I could slip off without being seen If it was found out the next morning I was called up to give an account of myself for going off without permission and would very often get a flogging for it I got myself into a scrape at a certain times by going off in this way and I expected to be severely punished for it I had a strong notion of running off to escape being flogged but was advised by a friend to go to one of those conjurers who could prevent me from being flogged I went and informed him of the difficulty He said if I would pay him a small sum he would prevent my being flogged After I had paid him he mixed up some alum salt and other stuff into a powder and said I must sprinkle it about my master if he should offer to strike me this would prevent him He also gave me some kind of bitter root to chew and spit towards him which would certainly prevent my being flogged According to order I used his remedy and for some cause I was let pass without being flogged that time I had then great faith in conjuration and witchcraft I was led to believe that I could do almost as I pleased without being flogged So on the next Sabbath my conjuration was fully tested by my going off and staying away until Monday morning without permission When I returned home my master declared that he would punish me for going off but I did not believe that he could do it while I had this root and dust and as he approached me I commenced talking saucy to him But he soon convinced me that there was no virtue in them He soon became so enraged at me for saucing him that he grasped a handful of switches and punished me severely in spite of all my roots and powders But there was another old slave in that neighborhood who professed to understand all about conjuration and I thought I would try his skill He told me that the first one was only a quack and if I would only pay him a certain amount in cash that he would tell me how to prevent any person from striking me After I had paid him his charge he told me to go to the cow pen after night and get some fresh cow manure and mix it with red pepper and white people's hair all to be put into a pot over the fire and scorched until it could be ground into snuff I was then to sprinkle it about my master's bedroom in his hat and boots and it would prevent him from ever abusing me in any way After I got it all ready prepared the smallest pinch of if scattered over a room was enough to make a horse sneeze from the strength of it but it did no good I tried it to my satisfaction It was my business to make fires in my master's chamber night and morning Whenever I could get a chance I sprinkled a Little of this dust about the linen of the bed where they would breathe it on retiring This was to act upon them as what is called a kind of love powder to change their sentiments of anger to those of love towards me but this all proved to be vain imagination The old man had my money and I was treated no better for it One night when I went in to make a fire I availed myself of the opportunity of sprinkling a very heavy charge of this powder about my master's bed Soon after their going to bed they began to cough and sneeze Being close around the house watching and listening to know what the effect would be I heard them ask each other what in the world it could be that made them cough and sneeze so All the while I was trembling with fear expecting every moment I should be called and asked if I knew any thing about it After this for fear they might find me out in my dangerous experiments upon them I had to give them up for the time being I was then convinced that running away was the most effectual way by which a slave could escape cruel punishment As all the instrumentalities which I as a slave could bring to bear upon the system had utterly failed to palliate my sufferings all hope and consolation fled I must be a slave for life and suffer under the lash or die The influence which this had only tended to make me more unhappy I resolved that I would be free if running away could make me so I had heard that Canada was a land of liberty somewhere in the North and every wave of trouble that rolled across my breast caused me to think more and more about Canada and liberty But more especially after having been flogged I have fled to the highest hills of the forest pressing my way to the North for refuge but the river Ohio was my limit To me it was an impassable gulf I had no rod wherewith to smite the stream and thereby divide the waters I had no Moses to go before me and lead the way from bondage to a promised land Yet I was in a far worse state than Egyptian bondage for they had houses and land I had none they had oxen and sheep I had none they had a wise counsel to tell them what to do and where to go and even to go with them I had none I was surrounded by opposition on every hand My friends were few and far between I have often felt when running away as if I had scarcely a friend on earth Sometimes standing on the Ohio River bluff looking over on a free State and as far north as my eyes could see I have eagerly gazed upon the blue sky of the free North which at times constrained me to cry out from the depths of my soul Oh Canada sweet land of rest Oh when shall I get there Oh that I had the wings of a dove that I might soar away to where there is no slavery no clanking of chains no captives no lacerating of backs no parting of husbands and wives and where man ceases to be the property of his fellow man These thoughts have revolved in my mind a thousand times I have stood upon the lofty banks of the river Ohio gazing upon the splendid steamboats wafted with all their magnificence up and down the river and I thought of the fishes of the water the fowls of the air the wild beasts of the forest all appeared to be free to go just where they pleased and I was an unhappy slave But my attention was gradually turned in a measure from this subject by being introduced into the society of young women This for the time being took my attention from running away as waiting on the girls appeared to be perfectly congenial to my nature I wanted to be well thought of by them and would go to great lengths to gain their affection I had been taught by the old superstitious slaves to believe in conjuration and it was hard for me to give up the notion for all I had been deceived by them One of these conjurers for a small sum agreed to teach me to make any girl love me that I wished After I had paid him he told me to get a bull frog and take a certain bone out of the frog dry it and when I got a chance I must step up to any girl whom I wished to make love me and scratch her somewhere on her naked skin with this bone and she would be certain to love me and would follow me in spite of herself no matter who she might be engaged to nor who she might be walking with So I got me a bone for a certain girl whom I knew to be under the influence of another young man I happened to meet her in the company of her lover one Sunday evening walking out so when I got a chance I fetched her a tremendous rasp across the neck with this bone which made her jump But in place of making her love me it only made her angry with me She felt more like running after me to retaliate on me for thus abusing her than she felt like loving me After I found there was no virtue in the bone of a frog I thought I would try some other way to carry out my object I then sought another counsellor among the old superstitious influential slaves one who professed to be a great friend of mine told me to get a lock of hair from the head of any girl and wear it in my shoes this would cause her to love me above all other persons As there was another girl whose affections I was anxious to gain but could not succeed I thought without trying the experiment of this hair I slipped off one night to see the girl and asked her for a lock of her hair but she refused to give it Believing that my success depended greatly upon this bunch of hair I was bent on having a look before I left that night let it cost what it might As it was time for me to start home in order to get any sleep that night I grasped hold of a lock of her hair which caused her to screech but I never let go until I had pulled it out This of course made the girl mad with me and I accomplished nothing but gained her displeasure Such are the superstitious notions of the great masses of southern slaves It is given to them by tradition and can never be erased while the doors of education are bolted and barred against them But there is a prohibition by law of mental and religious instruction The state of Georgia by an act of declared that it shall not be lawful for any number of free negroes molattoes or mestinos or even slaves in company with white persons to meet together for the purpose of mental instruction either before the rising of the sun or after the going down of the same d Brevard's Digest Similar laws exist in most of the slave States and patrols are sent out after night and on the Sabbath day to enforce them They go through their respective towns to prevent slaves from meeting for religious worship or mental instruction This is the regulation and law of American Slavery as sanctioned by the Government of the United States and without which it could not exist And almost the whole moral political and religious power of the nation are in favor of slavery and aggression against liberty and justice I only judge by their actions which speak louder than words Slaveholders are put into the highest offices in the gift of the people in both Church and State thereby making slaveholding popular and reputable III My Courtship and Marriage Change of owner My first born Its sufferings My wife abused My own anguish The circumstances of my courtship and marriage I consider to be among the most remarkable events of my life while a slave To think that after I had determined to carry out the great idea which is so universally and practically acknowledged among all the civilized nations of the earth that I would be free or die I suffered myself to be turned aside by the fascinating charms of a female who gradually won my attention from an object so high as that of liberty and an object which I held paramount to all others But when I had arrived at the age of eighteen which was in the year of it was my lot to be introduced to the favor of a mulatto slave girl named Malinda who lived in Oldham County Kentucky about four miles from the residence of my owner Malinda was a medium sized girl graceful in her walk of an extraordinary make and active in business Her shin was of a smooth texture red cheeks with dark and penetrating eyes She moved in the highest circle The distinction among slaves is as marked as the classes of society are in any aristocratic community Some refusing to associate with others whom they deem to be beneath them in point of character color condition or the superior importance of their respective masters of slaves and free people of color She was also one of the best singers I ever heard and was much esteemed by all who knew her for her benevolence talent and industry In fact I considered Malinda to be equalled by few and surpassed by none for the above qualities all things considered It is truly marvellous to see how sudden a man's mind can be changed by the charms and influence of a female The first two or three visits that I paid this dear girl I had no intention of courting or marrying her for I was aware that such a step would greatly obstruct my way to the land of liberty I only visited Malinda because I liked her company as a highly interesting girl But in spite of myself before I was aware of it I was deeply in love and what made this passion so effectual and almost irresistable I became satisfied that it was reciprocal There was a union of feeling and every visit made the impression stronger and stronger One or two other young men were paying attention to Malinda at the same time one of whom her mother was anxious to have her marry This of course gave me a fair opportunity of testing Malinda's sincerity I had just about opposition enough to make the subject interesting That Malinda loved me above all others on earth no one could deny I could read it by the warm reception with which the dear girl always met me and treated me in her mother's house I could read it by the warm and affectionate shake of the hand and gentle smile upon her lovely cheek I could read it by her always giving me the preference of her company by her pressing invitations to visit even in opposition to her mother's will I could read it in the language of her bright and sparkling eye penciled by the unchangable finger of nature that spake but could not lie These strong temptations gradually diverted my attention from my actual condition and from liberty though not entirely But oh that I had only then been enabled to have seen as I do now or to have read the following slave code which is but a stereotyped law of American slavery It would have saved me I think from having to lament that I was a husband and am the father of slaves who are still left to linger out their days in hopeless bondage The laws of Kentucky my native State with Maryland and Virginia which are said to be the mildest slave States in the Union noted for their humanity Christianity and democracy declare that Any slave for rambling in the night or riding horseback without leave or running away may be punished by whipping cropping and branding in the cheek or otherwise not rendering him unfit for labor Any slave convicted of petty larceny murder or wilfully burning of dwelling houses may be sentenced to have his right hand cut off to be hanged in the usual manner or the head severed from the body the body divided into four quarters and head and quarters stuck up in the most public place in the county where such act was committed At the time I joined my wife in holy wedlock I was ignorant of these ungodly laws I knew not that I was propogating victims for this kind of torture and cruelty Malinda's mother was free and lived in Bedford about a quarter of a mile from her daughter and we often met and passed off the time pleasantly Agreeable to promise on one Saturday evening I called to see Malinda at her mother's residence with an intention of letting her know my mind upon the subject of marriage It was a very bright moonlight night the dear girl was standing in the door anxiously waiting my arrival As I approached the door she caught my hand with an affectionate smile and bid me welcome to her mother's fireside After having broached the subject of marriage I informed her of the difficulties which I conceived to be in the way of our marriage and that I could never engage myself to marry any girl only on certain conditions near as I can recollect the substance of our conversation upon the subject it was that I was religiously inclined that I intended to try to comply with the requisitions of the gospel both theoretically and practically through life Also that I was decided on becoming a free man before I died and that I expected to get free by running away and going to Canada under the British Government Agreement on those two cardinal questions I made my test for marriage I said I never will give my heart nor hand to any girl in marriage until I first know her sentiments upon all important subjects of Religion and Liberty No matter how well I might love her nor how great the sacrifice in carrying out these God given principles And I here pledge myself from this course never to be shaken while a single pulsation of my heart shall continue to throb for Liberty With this idea Malinda appeared to be well pleased and with a smile she looked me in the face and said I have long entertained the same views and this has been one of the greatest reasons why I have not felt inclined to enter the married state while a slave I have always felt a desire to be free I have long cherished a hope that I should yet be free either by purchase or running away In regard to the subject of Religion I have always felt that it was a good thing and something that I would seek for at some future period After I found that Malinda was right upon these all important questions and that she truly loved me well enough to make me an affectionate wife I made proposals for marriage She very modestly declined answering the question then considering it to be one of a grave character and upon which our future destiny greatly depended And notwithstanding she confessed that I had her entire affections she must have some time to consider the matter To this I of course consented and was to meet her on the next Saturday night to decide the question But for some cause I failed to come and the next week she sent for me and on the Sunday evening following I called on her again she welcomed me with all the kindness of an affectionate lover and seated me by her side We soon broached the old subject of marriage and entered upon a conditional contract of matrimony viz that we would marry if our minds should not change within one year that after marriage we would change our former course and live a pious life and that we would embrace the earliest opportunity of running away to Canada for our liberty Clasping each other by the hand pledging our sacred honor that we would be true we called on high heaven to witness the rectitude of our purpose There was nothing that could be more binding upon us as slaves than this for marriage among American slaves is disregarded by the laws of this country It is counted a mere temporary matter it is a union which may be continued or broken off with or without the consent of a slaveholder whether he is a priest or a libertine There is no legal marriage among the slaves of the South I never saw nor heard of such a thing in my life and I have been through seven of the slave states A slave marrying according to law is a thing unknown in the history of American Slavery And be it known to the disgrace of our country that every slaveholder who is the keeper of a number of slaves of both sexes is also the keeper of a house or houses of ill fame Licentious white men can and do enter at night or day the lodging places of slaves break up the bonds of affection in families destroy all their domestic and social union for life and the laws of the country afford them no protection Will any man count if they can be counted the churches of Maryland Kentucky and Virginia which have slaves connected with them living in an open state of adultery never having been married according to the laws of the State and yet regular members of these various denominations but more especially the Baptist and Methodist churches And I hazard nothing in saying that this state of things exists to a very wide extent in the above states I am happy to state that many fugitive slaves who have been enabled by the aid of an over ruling providence to escape to the free North with those whom they claim as their wives notwithstanding all their ignorance and superstition are not at all disposed to live together like brutes as they have been compelled to do in slaveholding Churches But as soon as they got free from slavery they go before some anti slavery clergyman and have the solemn ceremony of marriage performed according to the laws of the country And if they profess religion and have been baptized by a slaveholding minister they repudiate it after becoming free and are re baptized by a man who is worthy of doing it according to the gospel rule The time and place of my marriage I consider one of the most trying of my life I was opposed by friends and foes my mother opposed me because she thought I was too young and marrying she thought would involve me in trouble and difficulty My mother in law opposed me because she wanted her daughter to marry a slave who belonged to a very rich man living near by and who was well known to be the son of his master She thought no doubt that his master or father might chance to set him free before he died which would enable him to do a better part by her daughter than I could And there was no prospect then of my ever being free But his master has neither died nor yet set his son free who is now about forty years of age toiling under the lash waiting and hoping that his master may die and will him to be free The young men were opposed to our marriage for the same reason that Paddy opposed a match when the clergyman was about to pronounce the marriage ceremony of a young couple He said if there be any present who have any objections to this couple being joined together in holy wedlock let them speak now or hold their peace henceforth At this time Paddy sprang to his feet and said Sir I object to this Every eye was fixed upon him What is your objection said the clergyman Faith replied Paddy Sir I want her myself The man to whom I belonged was opposed because he feared my taking off from his farm some of the fruits of my own labor for Malinda to eat in the shape of pigs chickens or turkeys and would count it not robbery So we formed a resolution that if we were prevented from joining in wedlock that we would run away and strike for Canada let the consequences be what they might But we had one consolation Malinda's master was very much in favor of the match but entirely upon selfish principles When I went to ask his permission to marry Malinda his answer was in the affirmative with but one condition which I consider to be too vulgar to be written in this book Our marriage took place one night during the Christmas holydays at which time we had quite a festival given us All appeared to be wide awake and we had quite a jolly time at my wedding party And notwithstanding our marriage was without license or sanction of law we believed it to be honorable before God and the bed undefiled Our christmas holydays were spent in matrimonial visiting among our friends while it should have been spent in running away to Canada for our liberty But freedom was little thought of by us for several months after marriage I often look back to that period even now as one of the most happy seasons of my life notwithstanding all the contaminating and heartrending features with which the horrid system of slavery is marked and must carry with it to its final grave yet I still look back to that season with sweet remembrance and pleasure that yet hath power to charm and drive back dull cares which have been accumulated by a thousand painful recollections of slavery Malinda was to me an affectionate wife She was with me in the darkest hours of adversity She was with me in sorrow and joy in fasting and feasting in trial and persecution in sickness and health in sunshine and in shade Some mouths after our marriage the unfeeling master to whom I belonged sold his farm with the view of moving his slaves to the State of Missouri regardless of the separation of husbands and wives forever but for fear of my resuming my old practice of running away if he should have forced me to leave my wife by my repeated requests he was constrained to sell me to his brother who lived within seven miles of Win Gatewood who then held Malinda as his property I was permitted to visit her only on Saturday nights after my work was done and I had to be at home before sunrise on Monday mornings or take a flogging He proved to be so oppressive and so unreasonable in punishing his victims that I soon found that I should have to run away in self defence But be soon began to take the hint and sold me to Wm Gatewood the owner of Malinda With my new residence I confess that I was much dissatisfied Not that Gatewood was a more cruel master than my former owner not that I was opposed to living with Malinda who was then the centre and object of my affections but to live where I must be eye witness to her insults scourgings and abuses such as are common to be inflicted upon slaves was more than I could bear If my wife must be exposed to the insults and licentious passions of wicked slave drivers and overseers if she must bear the stripes of the lash laid on by an unmerciful tyrant if this is to be done with impunity which is frequently done by slaveholders and their abettors Heaven forbid that I should be compelled to witness the sight Not many months after I took up my residence on Wm Gatewood's plantation Malinda made me a father The dear little daughter was called Mary Frances She was nurtured and caressed by her mother and father until she was large enough to creep over the floor after her parents and climb up by a chair before I felt it to be my duty to leave my family and go into a foreign country for a season Malinda's business was to labor out in the field the greater part of her time and there was no one take care of poor little Frances while her mother was toiling in the field She was left at the house to creep under the feet of an unmerciful old mistress whom I have known to slap with her hand the face of little Frances for crying after her mother until her little face was left black and blue I recollect that Malinda and myself came from the field one summer's day at noon and poor little Frances came creeping to her mother smiling but with large tear drops standing in her dear little eyes sobbing and trying to tell her mother that she had been abused but was not able to utter a word Her little face was bruised black with the whole print of Mrs Gatewood's hand This print was plainly to be seen for eight days after it was done But oh this darling child was a slave born of a slave mother Who can imagine what could be the feelings of a father and mother when looking upon their infant child whipped and tortured with impunity and they placed in a situation where they could afford it no protection But we were all claimed and held as property the father and mother were slaves On this same plantation I was compelled to stand and see my wife shamefully scourged and abused by her master and the manner in which this was done was so violently and inhumanly committed upon the person of a female that I despair in finding decent language to describe the bloody act of cruelty My happiness or pleasure was then all blasted for it was sometimes a pleasure to be with my little family even in slavery I loved them as my wife and child Little Frances was a pretty child she was quiet playful bright and interesting She had a keen black eye and the very image of her mother was stamped upon her cheek but I could never look upon the dear child without being filled with sorrow and fearful apprehensions of being separated by slaveholders because she was a slave regarded as property And unfortunately for me I am the father of a slave a word too obnoxious to be spoken by a fugitive slave It calls fresh to my mind the separation of husband and wife of stripping tying up and flogging of tearing children from their parents an selling them on the auction block It calls to mind female virtue trampled under foot with impunity But oh When I remember that my daughter my only child is still there destined to share the fate of all these calamities it is too much to bear If ever there was any one act of my life while a slave that I have to lament over it is that of being a father and a husband of slaves I I have the satisfaction of knowing that I am only the father of one slave She is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh poor unfortunate child She was the first and shall be the last slave that ever I will father for chains and slavery on this earth Illustration Can a mother forget her suckling child The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel IV My first adventure for liberty Parting scene Journey up the river Safe arrival in Cincinnati Journey to Canada Suffering from cold and hunger Denied food and shelter by some One noble exception Subsequent success Arrival at Perrysburgh I obtained employment through the winter My return to Kentucky to get my family In the fall or winter of I formed a resolution that I would escape if possible to Canada for my Liberty I commenced from that hour making preparations for the dangerous experiment of breaking the chains that bound me as a slave My preparation for this voyage consisted in the accumulation of a little money perhaps not exceeding two dollars and fifty cents and a suit which I had never been seen or known to wear before this last was to avoid detection On the twenty fifth of December my long anticipated time had arrived when I was to put into operation my former resolution which was to bolt for Liberty or consent to die a Slave I acted upon the former although I confess it to be one of the most self denying acts of my whole life to take leave of an affectionate wife who stood before me on my departure with dear little Frances in her arms and with tears of sorrow in her eyes as she bid me a long farewell It required all the moral courage that I was master of to suppress my feeling while taking leave of my little family Had Malinda known my intention at that time it would not have been possible for me to have got away and I might have this day been a slave Notwithstanding every inducement was held out to me to run away if I would be free and the voice of liberty was thundering in my very soul Be free oh man be free I was struggling against a thousand obstacles which had clustered around my mind to bind my wounded spirit still in the dark prison of mental degradation My strong attachments to friends and relatives with all the love of home and birth place which is so natural among the human family twined about my heart and were hard to break away from And withal the fear of being pursued with guns and blood hounds and of being killed or captured and taken to the extreme South to linger out my days in hopeless bondage on some cotton or sugar plantation all combined to deter me But I had counted the cost and was fully prepared to make the sacrifice The time for fulfilling my pledge was then at hand I must forsake friends and neighbors wife and child or consent to live and die a slave By the permission of my keeper I started out to work for myself on Christmas I went to the Ohio River which was but a short distance from Bedford My excuse for wanting to go there was to get work High wages were offered for hands to work in a slaughter house But in place of my going to work there according to promise when I arrived at the river I managed to find a conveyance to cross over into a free state I was landed in the village of Madison Indiana where steamboats were landing every day and night passing up and down the river which afforded me a good opportunity of getting a boat passage to Cincinnati My anticipation being worked up to the highest pitch no sooner was the curtain of night dropped over the village than I secreted myself where no one could see me and changed my suit ready for the passage Soon I heard the welcome sound of a Steamboat coming up the river Ohio which was soon to waft me beyond the limits of the human slave markets of Kentucky When the boat had landed at Madison notwithstanding my strong desire to get off my heart trembled within me in view of the great danger to which I was exposed in taking passage on board of a Southern Steamboat hence before I took passage I kneeled down before the Great I Am and prayed for his aid and protection which He bountifully bestowed even beyond my expectation for I felt myself to be unworthy I then stept boldly on the deck of this splendid swift running Steamer bound for the city of Cincinnati This being the first voyage that I had ever taken on board of a Steamboat I was filled with fear and excitement knowing that I was surrounded by the vilest enemies of God and man liable to be seized and bound hand and foot by any white man and taken back into captivity But I crowded myself back from the light among the deck passengers where it would be difficult to distinguish me from a white man Every time during the night that the mate came round with a light after the hands I was afraid he would see I was a colored man and take me up hence I kept from the light as much as possible Some men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil but this was not the case with myself it was to avoid detection in doing right This was one of the instances of my adventures that my affinity with the Anglo Saxon race and even slaveholders worked well for my escape But no thanks to them for it While in their midst they have not only robbed me of my labor and liberty but they have almost entirely robbed me of my dark complexion Being so near the color of a slaveholder they could not or did not find me out that night among the white passengers There was one of the deck hands on board called out on his watch whose hammock was swinging up near by me I asked him if he would let me lie in it He said if I would pay him twenty five cents that I might lie in it until day I readily paid him the price and got into the hammock No one could see my face to know whether I was white or colored while I was in the hammock but I never closed eyes for sleep that night I had often heard explosions on board of Steamboats and every time the boat landed and blowed off steam I was afraid the boilers had bursted and we should all be killed but I lived through the night amid the many dangers to which I was exposed I still maintained my position in the hammock until the next morning about o'clock when I heard the passengers saying the boat was near Cincinnati and by this time I supposed that the attention of the people would be turned to the city and I might pass off unnoticed There were no questions asked me while on board the boat The boat landed about o'clock in the morning in Cincinnati and I waited until after most of the passengers had gone off of the boat I then walked as gracefully up street as if I was not running away until I had got pretty well up Broadway My object was to go to Canada but having no knowledge of the road it was necessary for me to make some inquiry before I left the city I was afraid to ask a white person and I could see no colored person to ask But fortunately for me I found a company of little boys at play in the street and through these little boys by asking them indirect questions I found the residence of a colored man Boys can you tell me where that old colored man lives who saws wood and works at jobs around the streets What is his name said one of the boys I forget Is it old Job Dundy Is Dundy a colored man Yes sir That is the very man I am looking for will you show me where he lives Yes said the little boy and pointed me out the house Mr D invited me in and I found him to be a true friend He asked me if I was a slave from Kentucky and if I ever intended to go back into slavery Not knowing yet whether he was truly in favor of slaves running away I told him that I had just come over to spend my christmas holydays and that I was going back His reply was my son I would never go back if I was in your place you have a right to your liberty ' I then asked him how I should get my freedom He referred me to Canada over which waved freedom's flag defended by the British Government upon whose soil there cannot be the foot print of a slave He then commenced telling me of the facilities for my escape to Canada of the Abolitionists of the Abolition Societies and of their fidelity to the cause of suffering humanity This was the first time in my life that ever I had heard of such people being in existence as the Abolitionists I supposed that they were a different race of people He conducted me to the house of one of these warm hearted friends of God and the slave I found him willing to aid a poor fugitive on his way to Canada even to the dividing of the last cent or morsel of bread if necessary These kind friends gave me something to eat and started me on my way to Canada with a recommendation to a friend on my way This was the commencement of what was called the under ground rail road to Canada I walked with bold courage trusting in the arm of Omnipotence guided by the unchangable North Star by night and inspired by an elevated thought that I was fleeing from a land of slavery and oppression bidding farewell to hand cuffs whips thumb screws and chains I travelled on until I had arrived at the place where I was directed to call on an Abolitionist but I made no stop so great were my fears of being pursued by the pro slavery hunting dogs of the South I prosecuted my journey vigorously for nearly forty eight hours without food or rest struggling against external difficulties such as no one can imagine who has never experienced the same not knowing what moment I might be captured while travelling among strangers through cold and fear breasting the north winds being thinly clad pelted by the snow storms through the dark hours of the night and not a house in which I could enter to shelter me from the storm The second night from Cincinnati about midnight I thought that I should freeze my shoes were worn through and my feet were exposed to the bare ground I approached a house on the road side knocked at the door and asked admission to their fire but was refused I went to the next house and was refused the privilege of their fire side to prevent my freezing This I thought was hard treatment among the human family But Behind a frowning Providence there was a smiling face which soon shed beams of light upon unworthy me The next morning I was still found struggling on my way faint hungry lame and rest broken I could see people taking breakfast from the road side but I did not dare to enter their houses to get my breakfast for neither love nor money In passing a low cottage I saw the breakfast table spread with all its bounties and I could see no male person Illustration Never mind the money about the house the temptation for food was greater than I could resist I saw a lady about the table and I thought that if she was ever so much disposed to take me up that she would have to catch and hold me and that would have been impossible I stepped up to the door with my hat off and asked her if she would be good enough to sell me a sixpence worth of bread and meat She cut off a piece and brought it to me I thanked her for it and handed her the pay but instead of receiving it she burst into tears and said never mind the money but gently turned away bidding me go on my journey This was altogether unexpected to me I had found a friend in the time of need among strangers and nothing could be more cheering in the day of trouble than this When I left that place I started with bolder courage The next night I put up at a tavern and continued stopping at public houses until my means were about gone When I got to the Black Swamp in the county of Wood Ohio I stopped one night at a hotel after travelling all day through mud and snow but I soon found that I should not be able to pay my bill This was about the time that the wild cat banks were in a flourishing state and shin plasters Nick name for temporary paper money in abundance they would charge a dollar for one night's lodging After I had found out this I slipped out of the bar room into the kitchen where the landlady was getting supper as she had quite a number of travellers to cook for that night I told her if she would accept my services I would assist her in getting supper that I was a cook She very readily accepted the offer and I went to work She was very much pleased with my work and the next morning I helped her to get breakfast She then wanted to hire me for all winter but I refused for fear I might be pursued My excuse to her was that I had a brother living in Detroit whom I was going to see on some important business and after I got that business attended to I would come back and work for them all winter When I started the second morning they paid me fifty cents beside my board with the understanding that I was to return but I have not gone back yet I arrived the next morning in the village of Perrysburgh where I found quite a settlement of colored people many of whom were fugitive slaves I made my case known to them and they sympathized with me I was a stranger and they took me in and persuaded me to spend the winter in Perrysburgh where I could get employment and go to Canada the next spring in a steamboat which run from Perrysburgh if I thought it proper so to do I got a job of chopping wood during that winter which enabled me to purchase myself a suit and after paying my board the next spring I had saved fifteen dollars in cash My intention was to go back to Kentucky after my wife When I got ready to start which was about the first of May my friends all persuaded me not to go but to get some other person to go for fear I might be caught and sold off from my family into slavery forever But I could not refrain from going back myself believing that I could accomplish it better than a stranger The money that I had would not pass in the South and for the purpose of getting it off to a good advantage I took a steamboat passage to Detroit Michigan and there I spent all my money for dry goods to peddle out on my way back through the State of Ohio I also purchased myself a pair of false whiskers to put on when I got back to Kentucky to prevent any one from knowing me after night should they see me I then started back after my little family V My safe arrival at Kentucky Surprise and delight to find my family Plan for their escape projected Return to Cincinnati My betrayal by traitors Imprisonment in Covington Kentucky Return to slavery Infamous proposal of the slave catchers My reply I succeeded very well in selling out my goods and when I arrived in Cincinnati I called on some of my friends who had aided me on my first escape They also opposed me in going back only for my own good But it has ever been characteristic of me to persevere in what I undertake I took a Steamboat passage which would bring me to where I should want to land about dark so as to give me a chance to find my family during the night if possible The boat landed me at the proper at the proper time accordingly This landing was about six miles from Bedford where my mother and wife lived but with different families My mother was the cook at a tavern in Bedford When I approached the house where mother was living I remembered where she slept in the kitchen her bed was near the window It was a bright moonlight night and in looking through the kitchen window I saw a person lying in bed about where my mother had formerly slept I rapped on the glass which awakened the person in whom I recognised my dear mother but she knew me not as I was dressed in disguise with my false whiskers on but she came to the window and asked who I was and what I wanted But when I took off my false whiskers and spoke to her she knew my voice and quickly sprang to the door clasping my hand exclaiming Oh is this my son drawing me into the room where I was so fortunate as to find Malinda and little Frances my wife and child whom I had left to find the fair climes of liberty and whom I was then seeking to rescue from perpetual slavery They never expected to see me again in this life I am entirely unable to describe what my feelings were at that time It was almost like the return of the prodigal son There was weeping and rejoicing They were filled with surprise and fear with sadness and joy The sensation of joy at that moment flashed like lightning over my afflicted mind mingled with a thousand dreadful apprehensions that none but a heart wounded slave father and husband like myself can possibly imagine After talking the matter over we decided it was not best to start with my family that night as it was very uncertain whether we should get a boat passage immediately And in case of failure if Malinda should get back even before daylight the next morning it would have excited suspicion against her as it was not customary for slaves to leave home at that stage of the week without permission Hence we thought it would be the most effectual way for her to escape to start on Saturday night this being a night on which the slaves of Kentucky are permitted to visit around among their friends and are often allowed to stay until the afternoon on Sabbath day I gave Malinda money to pay her passage on board of a Steamboat to Cincinnati as it was not safe for me to wait for her until Saturday night but she was to meet me in Cincinnati if possible the next Sunday Her father was to go with her to the Ohio River on Saturday night and if a boat passed up during the night she was to get on board at Madison and come to Cincinnati If she should fail in getting off that night she was to try it the next Saturday night This was the understanding when we separated This we thought was the best plan for her escape as there had been so much excitement caused by my running away The owners of my wife were very much afraid that she would follow me and to prevent her they had told her and other slaves that I had been persuaded off by the Abolitionists who had promised to set me free but had sold me off to New Orleans They told the slaves to beware of the abolitionists that their object was to decoy off slaves and then sell them off in New Orleans Some of them believed this and others believed it not and the owners of my wife were more watchful over her than the had ever been before as she was unbelieving This was in the month of June I left Malinda on a bright but lonesome Wednesday night When I arrived at the river Ohio I found a small craft chained to a tree in which I ferried myself across the stream I succeeded in getting a Steamboat passage back to Cincinnati where I put up with one of my abolition friends who knew that I had gone after my family and who appeared to be much surprised to see me again I was soon visited by several friends who knew of my having gone back after my family They wished to know why I had not brought my family with me but after they understood the plan and that my family was expected to be in Cincinnati within a few days they thought it the best and safest plan for us to take a stage passage out to Lake Erie But being short of money I was not able to pay my passage in the stage even if it would have prevented me from being caught by the slave hunters of Cincinnati or save me from being taken back into bondage for life These friends proposed helping me by subscription I accepted their kind offer but in going among friends to solicit aid for me they happened to get among traitors and kidnappers both white and colored men who made their living by that kind of business Several persons called on me and made me small donations and among them two white men came in professing to be my friends They told me not to be afraid of them they were abolitionists They asked me a great many questions They wanted to know if I needed any help and they wanted to know if it could be possible that a man so near white as myself could be a slave Could it be possible that men would make slaves of their own children They expressed great sympathy for me and gave me fifty cents each by this they gained my confidence They asked my master's name where he lived c After which they left the room bidding me God speed These traitors or land pirates took passage on board of the first Steamboat down the river in search of my owners When they found them they got a reward of three hundred dollars offered for the re capture of this stray which they had so long and faithfully been hunting by day and by night by land and by water with dogs and with guns but all without success This being the last and only chance for dragging me back into hopeless bondage time and money was no object when they saw a prospect of my being re taken Mr Gatewood got two of his slaveholding neighbors to go with him to Cincinnati for the purpose of swearing to anything which might be necessary to change me back into property They came on to Cincinnati and with but little effort they soon rallied a mob of ruffians who were willing to become the watch dogs of slaveholders for a dram in connection with a few slavehunting petty constables While I was waiting the arrival of my family I got a job of digging a cellar for the good lady where I was stopping and while I was digging under the house all at once I heard a man enter the house another stept up to the cellar door to where I was at work he looked in and saw me with my coat off at work He then rapped over the cellar door on the house side to notify the one who had entered the house to look for me that I was in the cellar This strange conduct soon excited suspicion so strong in me that I could not stay in the cellar and started to come out but the man who stood by the door rapped again on the house side for the other to come to his aid and told me to stop I attempted to pass out by him and he caught hold of me and drew a pistol swearing if I did not stop he would shoot me down By this time I knew that I was betrayed I asked him what crime I had committed that I should be murdered I will let you know very soon said he By this time there were others coming to his aid and I could see no way by which I could possibly escape the jaws of that hell upon earth All my flattering prospects of enjoying my own fire side with my little family were then blasted and gone and I must bid farewell to friends and freedom forever In vain did I look to the infamous laws of the Commonwealth of Ohio for that protection against violence and outrage that even the vilest criminal with a white skin might enjoy But oh the dreadful thought that after all my sacrifice and struggling to rescue my family from the hands of the oppressor that I should be dragged back into cruel bondage to suffer the penalty of a tyrant's law to endure stripes and imprisonment and to be shut out from all moral as well as intellectual improvement and linger out almost a living death Illustration Squire's office When I saw a crowd of blood thirsty unprincipled slave hunters rushing upon me armed with weapons of death it was no use for me to undertake to fight my way through against such fearful odds But I broke away from the man who stood by with his pistol drawn to shoot me if I should resist and reached the fence and attempted to jump over it before I was overtaken but the fence being very high I was caught by my legs before I got over I kicked and struggled with all my might to get away but without success I kicked a new cloth coat off of his back while he was holding on to my leg I kicked another in his eye but they never let me go until they got more help By this time there was a crowd on the out side of the fence with clubs to beat me back Finally they succeeded in dragging me from the fence and overpowered me by numbers and choked me almost to death These ruffians dragged me through the streets of Cincinnati to what was called a justice office But it was more like an office of injustice When I entered the room I was introduced to three slaveholders one of whom was a son of Wm Gatewood who claimed me as his property They pretended to be very glad to see me They asked me if I did not want to see my wife and child but I made no reply to any thing that was said until I was delivered up as a slave After they were asked a few questions by the court the old pro slavery squire very gravely pronounced me to be the property of Mr Gatewood The office being crowded with spectators many of whom were colored persons Mr G was afraid to keep me in Cincinnati two or three hours even until a steamboat got ready to leave for the South So they took me across the river and looked me up in Covington jail for safe keeping This was the first time in my life that I had been put into a jail It was truly distressing to my feelings to be locked up in a cold dungeon for no crime The jailor not being at home his wife had to act in his place After my owners had gone back to Cincinnati the jailor's wife in company with another female came into the jail and talked with me very friendly I told them all about my situation and these ladies said they hoped that I might get away again and went so far as to tell me if I should be kept in the jail that night there was a hole under the wall of the jail where a prisoner had got out It was only filled up with loose dirt they said and I might scratch it out and clear myself This I thought was a kind word from an unexpected friend I had power to have taken the key from those ladies in spite of them and have cleared myself but knowing that they would have to suffer perhaps for letting me get away I thought I would wait until after dark at which time I should try to make my escape if they should not take me out before that time But within two or three hours they came after me and conducted me on board of a boat on which we all took passage down to Louisville I was not confined in any way but was well guarded by five men three of whom were slaveholders and the two young men from Cincinnati who had betrayed me After the boat had got fairly under way with these vile men standing around me on the upper deck of the boat and she under full speed carrying me back into a land of torment I could see no possible way of escape Yet while I was permitted to gaze on the beauties of nature on free soil as I passed down the river things looked to me uncommonly pleasant The green trees and wild flowers of the forest the ripening harvest fields waving with the gentle breezes of Heaven and the honest farmers tilling their soil and living by their own toil These things seem to light upon my vision with a peculiar charm I was conscious of what must be my fate a wretched victim for Slavery without limit to be sold like an ox into hopeless bondage and to be worked under the flesh devouring lash during life without wages This was to me an awful thought every time the boat run near the shore I was tempted to leap from the deck down into the water with a hope of making my escape Such was then my feeling But on a moment's reflection reason with her warning voice overcame this passion by pointing out the dreadful consequences of one's committing suicide And this I thought would have a very striking resemblance to the act and I declined putting into practice this dangerous experiment though the temptation was great These kidnapping gentlemen seeing that I was much dissatisfied commenced talking to me by saying that I must not be cast down they were going to take me back home to live with my family if I would promise not to run away again To this I agreed and told them that this was all that I could ask and more than I had expected But they were not satisfied with having recaptured me because they had lost other slaves and supposed that I knew their whereabouts and truly I did They wanted me to tell them but before telling I wanted them to tell who it was that had betrayed me into their hands They said that I was betrayed by two colored men in Cincinnati whose names they were backward in telling because their business in connection with themselves was to betray and catch fugitive slaves for the reward offered They undertook to justify the act by saying if they had not betrayed me that somebody else would and if I would tell them where they could catch a number of other runaway slaves they would pay for me and set me free and would then take me in as one of the Club They said I would soon make money enough to buy my wife and child out of slavery But I replied No gentlemen I cannot commit or do an act of that kind even if it were in my power so to do I know that I am now in the power of a master who can sell me from my family for life or punish me for the crime of running away just as he pleases I know that I am a prisoner for life and have no way of extricating myself and I also know that I have been deceived and betrayed by men who professed to be my best friends but can all this justify me in becoming a traitor to others Can I do that which I complain of others for doing unto me Never I trust while a single pulsation of my heart continues to beat can I consent to betray a fellow man like myself back into bondage who has escaped Dear as I love my wife and little child and as much as I should like to enjoy freedom and happiness with them I am unwilling to bring this about by betraying and destroying the liberty and happiness of others who have never offended me I then asked them again if they would do me the kindness to tell me who it was betrayed me into their hands at Cincinnati They agreed to tell me with the understanding that I was to tell where there was living a family of slaves at the North who had run away from Mr King of Kentucky I should not have agreed to this but I knew the slaves were in Canada where it was not possible for them to be captured After they had told me the names of the persons who betrayed me and how was done then I told them their slaves were in Canada doing well The two white men were Constables who claimed the right of taking up any strange colored person as a slave while the two colored kidnappers under the pretext of being abolitionists would find out all the fugitives they could and inform these Constables for which they got a part of the reward after they found out where the slaves were from the name of his master c By the agency of these colored men they were seized by a band of white ruffians locked up in jail and their master sent for These colored kidnappers with the Constables were getting rich by betraying fugitive slaves This was told to me by one of the Constables while they were all standing around trying to induce me to engage in the same business for the sake of regaining my own liberty and that of my wife and child But my answer even there under the most trying circumstances surrounded by the strongest enemies of God and man was most emphatically in the negative Let my punishment be what it may either with the lash or by selling me away from my friends and home let my destiny be what you please I call never engage in this business for the sake of getting free They said I should not be sold nor punished with the lash for what I had done but I should be carried back to Bedford to live with my wife Yet when the boat got to where we should have landed she wafted by without making any stop I felt awful in view of never seeing my family again they asked what was the matter what made me look so cast down I informed them that I knew I was to be sold in the Louisville slave market or in New Orleans and I never expected to see my family again But they tried to pacify me by promising not to sell me to a slave trader who would take me off to New Orleans cautioning me at the same time not to let it be known that I had had been a runaway This would very much lessen the value of me in market They would not punish me by putting irons on my limbs but would give me a good name and sell me to some gentleman in Louisville for a house servant They thought I would soon make money enough to buy myself and would not part with me if they could get along without But I had cost them so much in advertising and looking for me that they were involved by it In the first place they paid eight hundred and fifty dollars for me and when I first run away they paid one hundred for advertising and looking after me and now they had to pay about forty dollars expenses travelling to and from Cincinnati in addition to the three hundred dollars reward and they were not able to pay the reward without selling me I knew then the only alternative I left for me to extricate myself was to use deception which is the most effectual defence a slave can use I pretended to be satisfied for the purpose of getting an opportunity of giving them the slip But oh the distress of mind the lamentable thought that I should never again see the face nor hear the gentle voice of my nearest and dearest friends in this life I could imagine what must be my fate from my peculiar situation To be sold to the highest bidder and then wear the chains of slavery down to the grave The day star of liberty which had once cheered and gladdened my heart in freedom's land had then hidden itself from my vision and the dark and dismal frown of slavery had obscured the sunshine of freedom from me as they supposed for all time to come But the understanding between us was I was not to be tied chained nor flogged for if they should take me into the city handcuffed and guarded by five men the question might be asked what crime I had committed And if it should be known that I had been a runaway to Canada it would lessen the value of me at least one hundred dollaas Illustration Slave State Free State VI Arrival at Louisville Ky Efforts to sell me Fortunate escape from the man stealers in the public street I return to Bedford Ky The rescue of my family again attempted I started alone expecting them to follow After waiting some months I resolve to go back again to Kentucky When the boat arrived at Louisville the day being too far spent for them to dispose of me they had to put up at a Hotel When we left the boat they were afraid of my bolting from them in the street and to prevent this they took hold of my arms one on each side of me gallanting me up to the hotel with as much propriety as if I had been a white lady This was to deceive the people and prevent my getting away from them They called for a bed room to which I was conducted and locked within That night three of them lodged in the same room to guard me They locked the door and put the key under the head of their bed I could see no possible way for my escape without jumping out of a high three story house window It was almost impossible for me to sleep that night in my peculiar situation I passed the night in prayer to our Heavenly Father asking that He would open to me even the smallest chance for escape The next morning after they had taken breakfast four of them left me in the care of Dan Lane He was what might be called one of the watch dogs of Kentucky There was nothing too mean for him to do He never blushed to rob a slave mother of her children no matter how young or small He was also celebrated for slave selling kidnapping and negro hunting He was well known in that region by the slaves as well as the slaveholders to have all the qualifications necessary for his business He was a drunkard a gambler a profligate and a slaveholder While the other four were looking around through the city for a purchaser Dan was guarding me with his bowie knife and pistols After awhile the others came in with two persons to buy me but on seeing me they remarked that they thought I would run away and asked me if I had ever run away Dan sprang to his feet and answered the question for me by telling one of the most palpable falsehoods that ever came from the lips of a slaveholder He declared that I had never run away in my life Fortunately for me Dan while the others were away became unwell and from taking salts or from some other cause was compelled to leave his room Off he started to the horse stable which was located on one of the most public streets of Louisville and of course I had to accompany him He gallanted me into the stable by the arm and placed himself back in one of the horses stalls and ordered me to standby until he was ready to come out At this time a thousand thoughts were flashing through my mind with regard to the propriety of trying the springs of my heels which nature had so well adapted for taking the body out of danger even in the most extraordinary emergencies thought in the attempt to get away by running if I should not succeed it could make my condition no worse for they could but sell me and this they were then trying to do These thoughts impelled me to keep edging towards the door though very cautiously Dan kept looking around after me as if he was not satisfied at my getting so near to the door But the last I saw of him in the stable was just as he turned his eyes from me I nerved myself with all the moral courage I could command and bolted for the door perhaps with the fleetness of a much frightened deer who never looks behind in time of peril Dan was left in the stable to make ready for the race or jump out into the street half dressed and thereby disgrace himself before the public eye It would be impossible for me to set forth the speed with which I run to avoid my adversary I I succeeded in turning a corner before Dan got sight of me and by fast running turning corners and jumping high fences I was enabled to effect my escape In running so swiftly through the public streets I thought it would be a safer course to leave the public way and a quick as thought I spied a high board fence by the way and attempted to leap over it The top board broke and down I came into a hen coop which stood by the fence The dogs barked and the hens flew and cackled so that I feared it would lead to my detection before I could get out of the yard The reader can only imagine how great must have been the excited state of my mind while exposed to such extraordinary peril and danger on every side In danger of being seized by a savage dog which sprang at me when I fell into the hen coop in danger of being apprehended by the tenants of the lot in danger of being shot or wounded by any one who might have attempted to stop me a runaway slave and in danger on the other hand of being overtaken and getting in conflict with my adversary With these fearful apprehensions caution dictated me not to proceed far by day light in this slaveholding city At this moment every nerve and muscle of my whole system was in full stretch and every facility of the mind brought into action striving to save my self from being re captured I dared not go to the forest knowing that I might be tracked by blood hounds and overtaken I was so fortunate as to find a hiding place in the city which seemed to be pointed out by the finger of Providence After running across lots turning corners and shunning my fellow men as if they were wild ferocious beasts I found a hiding place in a pile of boards or scantling where I kept concealed during that day No tongue nor pen can describe the dreadful apprehensions under which I labored for the space of ten or twelve hours My hiding place happened to be between two workshops where there were men at work within six or eight feet of me I could imagine that I heard them talking about me and at other times thought I heard the footsteps of Daniel Lane in close pursuit But I retained my position there until or o'clock at night without being discovered after which I attempted to find my way out which was exceedingly difficult The night being very dark in a strange city among slaveholders and slave hunters to me it was like a person entering a wilderness among wolves and vipers blindfolded I was compelled from necessity to enter this place for refuge under the most extraordinary state of excitement without regard to its geographical position I found myself surrounded with a large block of buildings which comprised a whole square built up mostly on three sides so that I could see no way to pass out without exposing myself perhaps to the gaze of patrols or slave catchers In wandering around through the dark I happened to find a calf in a back yard which was bawling after the cow the cow was also lowing in another direction as if they were trying to find each other A thought struck me that there must be an outlet somewhere about where the cow and calf were trying to meet I started in the direction where I heard the lowing of the cow and I found an arch or tunnel extending between two large brick buildings where I could see nothing of the cow but her eyes shining like balls of fire through the dark tunnel between the walls through which I passed to where she stood When I entered the streets I found them well lighted up My heart was gladdened to know there was another chance for my escape No bird ever let out of a cage felt more like flying than I felt like running Before I left the city I chanced to find by the way an old man of color Supposing him to be a friend I ventured to make known my situation and asked him if he would get me a bite to eat The old man most cheerfully complied with my request I was then about forty miles from the residence of Wm Gatewood where my wife whom I sought to rescue from slavery was living This was also in the direction it was necessary for me to travel in order to get back to the free North Knowing that the slave catchers would most likely be watching the public highway for me to avoid them I made my way over the rocky hills woods and plantations back to Bedford I travelled all that night guided on my way by the shining stars of heaven alone The next morning just before the break of day I came right to a large plantation about which I secreted myself until the darkness of the next night began to disappear The morning larks commenced to chirp and sing merrily pretty soon I heard the whip crack and the voice of the ploughman driving in the corn field About breakfast time I heard the sound of a horn saw a number of slaves in the field with a white man who I supposed to be their overseer He started to the house before the slaves which gave me an opportunity to get the attention of one of the slaves whom I met at the fence before he started to his breakfast and made known to him my wants and distresses I also requested him to bring me a piece of bread if he could when he came back to the field The hospitable slave complied with my request He came back to the field before his follow laborers and brought me something to eat and as an equivolent for his kindness I instructed him with regard to liberty Canada the way of escape and the facilities by the way He pledged his word that himself and others would be in Canada in less than six months from that day This closed our interview and we separated I concealed myself in the forest until about sunset before I pursued my journey and the second night from Louisville I arrived again in the neighborhood of Bedford where my little family were held in bondage whom I so earnestly strove to rescue I concealed myself by the aid of a friend in that neighborhood intending again to make my escape with my family This confidential friend then carried a message to Malinda requesting her to meet me on one side of the village We met under the most fearful apprehensions for my pursuers had returned from Louisville with the lamentable story that I was gone and yet they were compelled to pay three hundred dollars to the Cincinnati slave catchers for re capturing me there Daniel Lane's account of my escape from him looked so unreasonable to slaveholders that many of them charged him with selling me and keeping the money while others believed that I had got away from him and was then in the neighborhood trying to take off my wife and child which was true Lane declared that in less than five minutes after I run out of the stable in Louisville he had over twenty men running and looking in every direction after me but all without success They could hear nothing of me They had turned over several tons of hay in a large loft in search and I was not to be found there Dan imputed my escape to my godliness He said that I must have gone up in a chariot of fire for I went off by flying and that he should never again have any thing to do with a praying negro Great excitement prevailed in Bedford and many were out watching for me at the time Malinda was relating to me these facts The excitement was then so great among the slaveholders who were anxious to have me re captured as a means of discouraging other slaves from running away that time and money were no object while there was the least prospect of their success I therefore declined making an effort just at that time to escape with my little family Malinda managed to get me into the house of a friend that night in the village where I kept concealed several days seeking an opportunity to escape with Malinda and Frances to Canada But for some time Malinda was watched so very closely by white and by colored persons both day and night that it was not possible for us to escape together They well knew that my little family was the only object of attraction that I ever had or ever would induce me to come back and risk my liberty over the threshold of slavery therefore this point was well guarded by the watch dogs of slavery and I was compelled again to forsake my wife for a season or surrender which was suicidal to the cause of freedom in my judgment The next day after my arrival in Bedford Daniel Lane came to the very house wherein I was concealed and talked in my hearing to the family about my escape from him out of the stable in Louisville He was near enough for me to have laid my hands on his head while in that house and the intimidation which this produced on me was more than I could bear I was also aware of the great temptation of the reward offered to white or colored persons for my apprehension I was exposed to other calamities which rendered it altogether unsafe for me to A longer under that roof One morning about o'clock I took leave of my little family and started for Canada This was almost like tearing off the limbs from my body When we were about to separate Malinda clasped my hand exclaiming oh my soul my heart is almost broken at the thought of this dangerous separation This may be the last time we shall ever see each other's faces in this life which will destroy all my future prospects of life and happiness forever At this time the poor unhappy woman burst into tears and wept loudly and my eyes were not dry We separated with the understanding that she was to wait until the excitement was all over after which she was to meet me at certain place in the State of Ohio which would not be longer than two months from that time I succeeded that night in getting a steamboat conveyance Illustration My heart is almost broken back to Cincinnati or within ten miles of the city I was apprehensive that there were slave hunters in Cincinnati watching the arrival Of every boat up the river expecting to catch me and the boat landing to take in wood ten miles below the city I got off and walked into Cincinnati to avoid detection No my arrival at the house of a friend I heard that the two young men who betrayed me for the three hundred dollars had returned and were watching for me One of my friends in whom they had great confidence called on the traitors after he had talked with me and asked them what they had done with me Their reply was that I had given them the slip and that they were glad of it because they believed that I was a good man and if they could see me on my way to Canada they would give me money to add me on my escape My friend assured them that if they would give any thing to aid me on my way much or little if they would put the same into his hands he would give it to me that night or return it to them the next morning They then wanted to know where I was and whether I was in the city but he would not tell them but one of them gave him one dollar for me promising that if I was in the city and he would let him know the next morning he would give me ten dollars But I never waited for the ten dollars I received one dollar of the amount which they got for betraying me and started that night for the north Their excuse for betraying me was that catching runaways was their business and if they had not done it somebody else would but since they had got the reward they were glad that I had made my escape Having travelled the road several times from Cincinnati to Lake Erie I travelled through without much fear or difficulty My friends in Perrysburgh who knew that I had gone back into the very jaws of slavery after my family were much surprised at my return for they had heard that I was re captured After I had waited three months for the arrival of Malinda and she came not it caused me to be one of the most unhappy fugitives that ever left the South I had waited eight or nine months without hearing from my family I felt it to be my duty as a husband and father to make one more effort I felt as if I could not give them up to be sacrificed on the bloody altar of slavery I felt as if love duty humanity and justice required that I should go back putting my trust in the God of Liberty for success VII My safe return to Kentucky The perils I encountered there Again betrayed and taken by a mob ironed and imprisoned Narrow escape from death Life in a slave prison I prepared myself for the journey before named and started back in the month of July My intention was to let no person know my business until I returned back to the North I went to Cincinnati and got a passage down on board of a boat just as I did the first time without any misfortune or delay I called on my mother and the raising of a dead body from the grave could not have been more surprising to any one than my arrival was to her on that sad summer's night She was not able to suppress her feelings When I entered the room there was but one other person in the house with my mother and this was a little slave girl who was asleep when I entered The impulsive feeling which is ever ready to act itself out at the return of a long absent friend was more than my bereaved mother could suppress And unfortunately for me the loud shouts of joy at that late hour of the night awakened the little slave girl who afterwards betrayed me She kept perfectly still and never let either of us know that she was awake in order that she might hear our conversation and report it Mother informed me where my family was living and that she would see them the next day and would make arrangements for us to meet the next night at that house after the people in the village had gone to bed I then went off and concealed myself during the next day and according to promise came back the next night about eleven o'clock When I got near the house moving very cautiously filled with fearful apprehensions I saw several men walking around the house as if they were looking for some person I went back and waited about one hour before I returned and the number of men had increased They were still to be seen lurking about this house with dogs following them This strange movement frightened me off again and I never returned until after midnight at which time I slipped up to the window and rapped for my mother who sprang to it and informed me that I was betrayed by the girl who overheard our conversation the night before She thought that if I could keep out of the way for a few days the white people would think that this girl was mistaken or had lied She had told her old mistress that I was there that night and had made a plot with my mother to get my wife and child there the next night and that I was going to take them off to Canada I went off to a friend of mine who rendered me all the aid that one slave could render another under the circumstances Thank God he is now free from slavery and is doing well He was a messenger for me to my wife and mother until at the suggestion of my mother I changed an old friend for a new one who betrayed me for the sum of five dollars We had set the time when we were to start for Canada which was to be on the next Saturday night My mother had an old friend whom she thought was true and she got him to conceal me in a barn not over two miles from the village This man brought provisions to me sent by my mother and would tell me the news which was in circulation about me among the citizens But the poor fellow was not able to withstand the temptation of money My owners had about given me up and thought report of the slave girl was false but they had offered a little reward among the slaves for my apprehension The night before I was betrayed I met with my mother and wife and we had set up nearly all night plotting to start on the next Saturday night I hid myself away in the flax in the barn and being much rest broken I slept until the next morning about o'clock Then I was awakened by a mob of blood thirsty slaveholders who had come armed with all the implements of death with a determination to reduce me again to a life of slavery or murder me on the spot When I looked up and saw that I was surrounded they were exclaiming at the top of their voices shoot him down shoot him down If he offers to run or to resist kill him I saw it was no use then for me to make any resistance as I should be murdered I felt confident that I had been betrayed by a slave and all my flattering prospects of rescuing my family were gone for ever and the grim monster slavery with all its horrors was staring me in the face I surrendered myself to this hostile mob at once The first thing done after they had laid violent hands on me was to bind my hands behind me with a cord and rob me of all I possessed In searching my pockets they found my certificate from the Methodist E Church which had been given me by my classleader testifying to my worthiness as a member of that church And what made the matter look more disgraceful to me many of this mob were members of the M E Church and they were the persons who took away my church ticket and then robbed me also of fourteen dollars in cash a silver watch for which I paid ten dollars a pocket knife for which I paid seventy five cents and a Bible for which I paid sixty two and one half cents All this they tyrannically robbed me of and yet my owner Wm Gatewood was a regular member of the same church to which I belonged He then had me taken to a blacksmith's shop and most wickedly had my limbs bound with heavy irons and then had my body locked within the cold dungeon walls of the Bedford jail to be sold to a Southern slave trader My heart was filled with grief my eyes were filled with tears I could see no way of escape I could hear no voice of consolation Slaveholders were coming to the dungeon window in great numbers to ask me questions Some were rejoicing some swearing and others saying that I ought to be hung while others were in favor of sending both me and my wife to New Orleans They supposed that I had informed her all about the facilities for slaves to escape to Canada and that she would tell other slaves after I was gone hence we must all be sent off to where we could neither escape ourselves nor instruct others the way In the afternoon of the same day Malinda was permitted to visit the prison wherein I was locked but was not permitted to enter the door When she looked through the dungeon grates and saw my sad situation which was caused by my repeated adventures to rescue her and my little daughter from the grasp of slavery it was more than she could bear without bursting in tears She plead for admission into the cold dungeon where I was confined but without success With manacled limbs with wounded spirit with sympathising tears and with bleeding heart I intreated Malinda to weep not for me for it only added to my grief which was greater than I could bear I have often suffered from the sting of the cruel slave driver's lash on my quivering flesh I have suffered from corporeal punishment in its various forms I have mingled my sorrows with those that were bereaved by the ungodly soul drivers and I also know what it is to shed the sympathetic tear at the grave of a departed friend but all this is but a mere trifle compared with my sufferings from then to the end of six months subsequent The second night while I was in jail two slaves came to the dungeon grates about the dead hour of night and called me to the grates to have some conversation about Canada and the facilities for getting there They knew that I had travelled over the road and they were determined to run away and go where they could be free I of course took great pleasure in giving them directions how and where to go and they started in less than a week from that time and got clear to Canada I have seen them both since I came back to the north myself They were known by the names of King and Jack The third day I was brought out of the prison to be carried off with my little family to the Louisville slave market My hands were fastened together with heavy irons and two men to guard me with loaded rifles one of whom led the horse upon which I rode My wife and child were set upon another nag After we were all ready to start my old master thought I was not quite safe enough and ordered one of the boys to bring him a bed cord from the store He then tied my feet together under the horse declaring that if I flew off this time I should fly off with the horse Many tears were shed on that occasion by our friends and relatives who saw us dragged off in irons to be sold in the human flesh market No tongue could express the deep anguish of my soul when I saw the silent tear drops streaming down the sable cheeks of an aged slave mother at my departure and that too caused by a black hearted traitor who was himself a slave I love the man with a feeling soul Whose passions are deep and strong Whose cords when touched with a kindred power Will vibrate loud and long The man whose word is bond and law Who ne'er for gold or power Would kiss the hand that would stab the heart In adversity's trying hour I love the man who delights to help The panting struggling poor The man that will open his heart Nor close against the fugitive at his door Oh give me a heart that will firmly stand When the storm of affliction shall lower A hand that will never shrink if grasped In misfortune's darkest hour As we approached the city of Louisville we attracted much attention my being tied and handcuffed and a person leading the horse upon which I rode The horse appeared to be much frightened at the appearance of things in the city being young and skittish A carriage passing by jammed against the nag which caused him to break from the man who was leading him and in his fright throw me off backwards My hands being confined with irons and my feet tied under the horse with a rope I had no power to help myself I fell back off of the horse and could not extricate myself from this dreadful condition the horse kicked with all his might while I was tied so close to his rump that he could only strike me with his legs by kicking The breath was kicked out of my body but my bones were not broken No one who saw my situation would have given five dollars for me It was thought by all that I was dead and would never come to life again When the horse was caught the cords were cut from my limbs and I was rubbed with whiskey camphor c which brought me to life again Many bystanders expressed sympathy for me in my deplorable condition and contempt for the tyrant who tied me to the young horse I was then driven through the streets of the city with my little family on foot to jail wherein I was locked with handcuffs yet on A physician was then sent for who doctored me several days before I was well enough to be sold in market The jail was one of the most disagreeable places I ever was confined in It was not only disagreeable on account of the filth and dirt of the most disagreeable kind but there were bed bugs fleas lice and musquitoes in abundance to contend with At night we had to lie down on the floor in this filth Our food was very scanty and of the most inferior quality No gentleman's dog would eat what we were compelled to eat or starve I had not been in this prison many days before Madison Garrison the soul driver bought me and my family to sell again in the New Orleans slave market He was buying up slaves to take to New Orleans So he took me and my little family to the work house to be kept under lock and key at work until he had bought up as many as he wished to take off to the South The work house of Louisville was a very large brick building built on the plan of a jail or State's prison with many apartments to it divided off into cells wherein prisoners were locked up after night The upper apartments were occupied by females principally This prison was enclosed by a high stone wall upon which stood watchmen with loaded guns to guard the prisoners from breaking out and on either side there were large iron gates When Garrison conducted me with my family to the prison in which we were to be confined until he was ready to take us to New Orleans I was shocked at the horrid sight of the prisoners on entering the yard When the large iron gate or door was thrown open to receive us it was astonishing to see so many whites as well as colored men loaded down with irons at hard labor under the supervision of overseers Some were sawing stone some cutting stone and others breaking stone The first impression which was made on my mind when I entered this place of punishment made me think of hell with all its terrors of torment such as weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth which was then the idea that I had of the infernal regions from oral instruction And I doubt whether there can be a better picture of it drawn than may be sketched from an American slave prison In this prison almost every prisoner had a heavy log chain riveted about his leg It would indeed be astonishing to a christian man to stand in that prison one half hour and hear and see the contaminating influence of Southern slavery on the body and mind of man you may there find almost every variety of character to look on Some signing some crying some praying and others swearing The people of color who were in there were slaves there without crime but for safe keeping while the whites were some of the most abandoned characters living The keeper took me up to the anvil block and fastened a chain about my leg which I had to drag after me both day and night during three months My labor was sawing stone my food was coarse corn bread and beef shanks and cows heads with pot liquor and a very scanty allowance of that I have often seen the meat spoiled when brought to us covered with flies and fly blows and even worms crawling over it when we were compelled to eat it or go without any at all It was all spread out on a long table in separate plates and at the sound of a bell every one would take his plate asking no questions After hastily eating we were hurried back to our work each man dragging a heavy log chain after him to his work About a half hour before night they were commanded to stop work take a bite to eat and then be locked up in a small cell until the next morning after sunrise The prisoners were locked in two together My bed was a cold stone floor with but little bedding My visitors were bed bugs and musquitoes VIII Character of my prison companions Jail breaking contemplated Defeat of our plan My wife and child removed Disgraceful proposal to her and cruel punishment Our departure in a coffle for New Orleans Events of our journey Most of the inmates of this prison I have described were white men who had been sentenced there by the law for depredations committed by them There was in that prison gamblers drunkards thieves robbers adulterers and even murderers There were also in the female department harlots pick pockets and adulteresses In such company and under such influences where there was constant swearing lying cheating and stealing it was impossible for a virtuous person to avoid pollution or to maintain their virtue No place or places in this country can be better calculated to inculcate vice of every kind than a Southern work house or house of correction After a profligate thief or a robber has learned all that they can out of the prison they might go in one of those prisons and learn something more they might properly be called robber colleges and if slaveholders understood this they would never let their slaves enter them No man would give much for a slave who had been kept long in one of these prisons I have often heard them telling each other how they robbed houses and persons on the high way by knocking them down and would rob them pick their pockets and leave them half dead Others would tell of stealing horses cattle sheep and slaves and when they would be sometimes apprehended by the aid of their friends they would break jail But they could most generally find enough to swear them clear of any kind of villany They seemed to take great delight in telling of their exploits in robbery There was a regular combination of them who had determined to resist law wherever they went to carry out their purposes In conversing with myself they learned that I was notorious for running away and professed sympathy for me They thought that I might yet get to Canada and be free and suggested a plan by which I might accomplish it and one way was to learn to read and write so that I might write myself a pass ticket to go just where I pleased when I was taken out of the prison and they taught me secretly all they could while in the prison But there was another plan which they suggested to me to get away from slavery that was to break out of the prison and leave my family I consented to engage in this plot but not to leave my family By my conduct in the prison after having been there several weeks I had gained the confidence of the keeper and the turnkey So much so that when I wanted water or anything of the kind they would open my door and hand it in to me One of the turnkeys was an old colored man who swept and cleaned up the cells supplied the prisoners with water c On Sundays in the afternoon the watchmen of the prison were most generally off and this old slave whose name was Stephen had the prisoners to attend to The white prisoners formed a plot to break out on Sunday in the afternoon by making me the agent to get the prison keys from old Stephen I was to prepare a stone that would weigh about one pound tie it up in a rag and keep it in my pocket to strike pool old Stephen with when he should open my cell door But this I would not consent to do without he should undertake to betray me I gave old Stephen one shilling to buy me a water melon which he was to bring to me in the afternoon All the prisoners were to be ready to strike just as soon as I opened their doors When Stephen opened my door to hand me the melon I was to grasp him by the collar raise the stone over his head and say to him that if he made any alarm that I should knock him down with the stone But if he would be quiet he should not be hurt I was then to take all the keys from him and lock him up in the cell take a chisel and cut the chain from my own leg then unlock all the cells below and let out the other prisoners who were all to cut off their chains We were then to go and let out old Stephen and make him go off with us We were to form a line and march to the front gate of the prison with a sledge hammer and break it open and if we should be discovered and there should be any out cry we were all to run and raise the alarm of fire so as to avoid detection But while we were all listening for Stephen to open the door with the melon he came and reported that he could not got one and handed me back the money through the window All were disappointed and nothing done I looked upon it as being a fortunate thing for me for it was certainly a very dangerous experiment for a slave and they could never get me to consent to be the leader in that matter again A few days after another plot was concocted to to break prison but it was betrayed by one of the party which resulted in the most cruel punishment to the prisoners concerned in it and I felt thankful that my name was not connected with it They were not only flogged but they were kept on bread and water alone for many days A few days after we were put in this prison Garrison came and took my wife and child out I knew not for what purpose nor to what place but after the absence of several days I supposed that he had sold them But one morning the outside door was thrown open and Malinda thrust in by the ruthless hand of Garrison whose voice was pouring forth the most bitter oaths and abusive language that could be dealt out to a female while her heart rending shrieks and sobbing was truly melting to the soul of a father and husband The language of Malinda was Oh my dear little child is gone What shall I do my child is gone This most distressing sound struck a sympathetic chord through all the prison among the prisoners I was not permitted to go to my wife and inquire what had become of little Frances I never expected to see her again for I supposed that she was sold That night however I had a short interview with my much abused wife who told me the secret She said that Garrison had taken her to a private house where he kept female slaves for the basest purposes It was a resort for slave trading profligates and soul drivers who were interested in the same business Soon I after she arrived at this place Garrison gave her to understand what he brought her there for and made a most disgraceful assault on her virtue which she promptly repeled and for which Garrison punished her with the lash threatening her that if she did not submit that he would sell her child The next day he made the same attempt which she resisted declaring that she would not submit to it and again he tied her up and flogged her until her garments were stained with blood He then sent our child off to another part of the city and said he meant to sell it and that she should never see it again He then drove Malinda before him to the work house swearing by his Maker that submit to him or die I have already described her entrance in the prison Two days after this he came again and took Malinda out of the prison It was several weeks before I saw her again and learned that he had not sold her or the child At the same time he was buying up other slaves to take to New Orleans At the expiration of three months he was ready to start with us for the New Orleans slave market but we never knew when we were to go until the hour had arrived for our departure One Sabbath morning Garrison entered the prison and commanded that our limbs should be made ready for the coffles They called us up to an anvil block and the heavy log chains which we had been wearing on our legs during three months were cut off I had been in the prison over three months but he had other slaves who had not been there so long The hand cuffs were then put on to our wrists We were coupled together two and two the right hand of one to the left hand of another and a long chain to connect us together The other prisoners appeared to be sorry to see us start off in this way We marched off to the river Ohio to take passage on board of the steam boat Water Witch But this was at a very low time of water in the fall of The boat got aground and did not get off that night and Garrison had to watch us all night to keep any from getting away He also had a very large savage dog which was trained up to catch runaway slaves We were more than six weeks getting to the city of New Orleans in consequence of low water We were shifted on to several boats before we arrived at the mouth of the river Ohio But we got but very little rest at night As all were chained together night and day it was impossible to sleep being annoyed by the bustle and crowd of the passengers on board by the terrible thought that we were destined to be sold in market as sheep or oxen and annoyed by the galling chains that cramped our wearied limbs on the tedious voyage But I had several opportunities to have run away from Garrison before we got to the mouth of the Ohio river While they were shifting us from one boat to another my hands were some times loosed until they got us all on board and I know that I should have broke away had it not been for the sake of my wife and child who was with me I could see no chance to get them off and I could not leave them in that condition and Garrison was not so much afraid of my running away from him while he held on to my family for he knew from the great sacrifices which I had made to rescue them from slavery that my attachment was too strong to run off and leave them in his hands while there was the least hope of ever getting them away with me Illustration Illustration IX Our arrival and examination at Vicksburg An account of slave sales Cruel punishment with the paddle Attempts to sell myself by Garrison's direction Amusing interview with a slave buyer Deacon Whitfield's examination He purchases the family Character of the Deacon WHEN we arrived at the city of Vicksburg he intended to sell a portion of his slaves there and stopped for three weeks trying to sell But he met with very poor success We had there to pass through an examination or inspection by a city officer whose business it was to inspect slave property that was brought to that Market for sale He examined our backs to see if we had been much scarred by the lash He examined our limbs to see whether we were inferior As it is hard to tell the ages of slaves they look in their mouths at their teeth and prick up the skin on the back of their hands and if the person is very far advanced in life when the skin is pricked up the pucker will stand so many seconds on the back of the hand But the most rigorous examinations of slaves by those slave inspectors is on the mental capacity If they are found to be very intelligent this is pronounced the most objectionable of all other qualities connected with the life of a slave In fact it undermines the whole fabric of his chattelhood it prepares for what slaveholders are pleased to pronounce the unpardonable sin when committed by a slave It lays the foundation for running away and going to Canada They also see in it a love for freedom patriotism insurrection bloodshed and exterminating war against American slavery Hence they are very careful to inquire whether a slave who is for sale can read or write This question has been asked me often by slave traders and cotton planters while I was there for market After conversing with me they have sworn by their Maker that they would not have me among their negroes and that they saw the devil in my eye I would run away c I have frequently been asked also if I had ever answer run away but Garrison would generally this question for me in the negative He could have sold my little family without any trouble for the sum of one thousand dollars But for fear he might not get me off at so great an advantage as the people did not like my appearance he could do better by selling us all together They all wanted my wife while but very few wanted me He asked twenty five hundred dollars but was not able to get us off at that price He tried to speculate on my Christian character He tried to make it appear that I was so pious and honest that I would not runaway for ill treatment which was a gross mistake for I never had religion enough to keep me from running away from slavery in my life But we were taken from Vicksburgh to the city of New Orleans were we were to be sold at any rate We were taken to a trader's yard or a slave prison on the corner of' St Joseph street This was a common resort for slave traders and planters who wanted to buy slaves and all classes of slaves were kept there for sale to be sold in private or public young or old males or females children or parents husbands or wives Everyday at o'clock they were exposed for sale They had to be in trim for showing themselves to the public for sale Every one's head had to be combed and their faces washed and those who were inclined to look dark and rough were compelled to wash in greasy dish water to look slick and lively When spectators would come in the yard the slaves were ordered out to form a line They were made to stand up straight and look as sprightly as they could and when they were asked a question they had to answer it as promptly as they could and try to induce the spectators to buy them If they failed to do this they were severely paddled after the spectators were gone The object for using the paddle in the place of a lash was to conceal the marks which would be made by the flogging And the object for flogging under such circumstances is to make the slaves anxious to be sold The paddle is made of a piece of hickory timber about one inch thick three inches in width and about eighteen inches in length The part is applied to the flesh is bored full of quarter inch Illustration Illustration auger holes and every time this is applied to the flesh of the victim the blood gushes through the holes of the paddle or a blister makes its appearance The persons who are thus flogged are always stripped naked and their hands tied together They are then bent over double their knees are forced between their elbows and a stick is put through between the elbows and the bend of the legs in order to hold the victim in that position while the paddle is applied to those parts of the body which would not be so likely to be seen by those who wanted to buy slaves See on I was kept in this prison for several months and no one would buy me for fear I would run away One day while I was in this prison Garrison got mad with my wife and took her off in one of the rooms with his paddle in hand swearing that he would paddle her and I could afford her no protection at all while the strong arm of the law public opinion and custom were all against me I have often heard Garrison say that he had rather paddle a female than eat when he was hungry that it was music for him to hear them scream and too see their blood run After the lapse of several months he found that he could not dispose of my person to a good advantage while he kept me in that prison confined among the other slaves I do not speak with vanity when I say the contrast was so great between myself and ordinary slaves from the fact that I had enjoyed superior advantages to which I have already referred They have their slaves classed off and numbered Garrison came to me one day and informed me that I might go out through the city and find myself a master I was to go to the Hotels boarding houses c tell them that my wife was a good cook wash woman c and that I was a good dining room servant carriage driver or porter and in this way I might find some gentleman who would buy us both and that this was the only hope of our being sold together But before starting me out he dressed me up in a suit of his old clothes so as to make me look respectable and I was so much better dressed than usual that I felt quite gay He would not allow my wife to go out with me however for fear we might get away I was out every day for several weeks three or four hours in each day trying to find a new master but without success Many of the old French inhabitants have taken slaves for their wives in this city and their own children for their servants Such commonly are called Creoles They are better treated than other slaves and I resembled this class in appearance so much that the French did not want me Many of them set their mulatto children free and make slaveholders of them At length one day I heard that there was a gentleman in the city from the State of Tennessee to buy slaves He had brought down two rafts of lumber for market and I thought if I could get him buy me with my family and take us to Tennessee from there I would stand a better opportunity to run away again and get to Canada than I would from the extreme South So I brushed up myself and walked down to the river's bank where the man was pointed out to me standing on board of his raft I approached him and after passing the usual compliments I said Sir I understand that you wish to purchase a lot of servants and I have called to know if it is so He smiled and appeared to be much pleased at my visit on such laudable business supposing me to be a slave trader He commenced rubbing his hands together and replied by saying Yes sir I am glad to see you It is a part of my business here to buy slaves and if I could get you to take my lumber in part pay I should like to buy four or five of your slaves at any rate What kind of slaves have you sir After I found that he took me to be a slave trader I knew that it would be of no use for me to tell him that I was myself a slave looking for a master for he would have doubtless brought up the same objection that others had brought up that I was too white and that they were afraid that I could read and write and would never serve as a slave but run away My reply to the question respecting the quality of my slaves was that I did not think his lumber would suit me that I must have the cash for my negroes and turned on my heel and left him I returned to the prison and informed my wife of the fact that I had been taken to be a slaveholder She thought that in addition to my light complexion my being dressed up in Garrison's old slave trading clothes might have caused the man to think that I was a slave trader and she was afraid that we should yet be separated if I should not succeed in finding some body to buy us Every day to us was a day of trouble and every night brought new and fearful apprehensions that the golden link which binds together husband and wife might be broken by the heartless tyrant before the light of another day Deep has been the anguish of my soul when looking over my little family during the silent hours of the night knowing the great danger of our being sold off at auction the next day and parted forever That this might not come to pass many have been the tears and prayers which I have offered up to the God of Israel that we might be preserved While waiting here to be disposed of I heard of one Francis Whitfield a cotton planter who wanted to buy slaves He was represented to be a very pious soul being a deacon of a Baptist church As the regulations as well as public opinion generally were against slaves meeting for religious worship I thought it would give me a better opportunity to attend to my religious duties should I fall into the hands of this deacon So I called on him and tried to show to the best advantage for the purpose of inducing him to buy me and my family When I approached him I felt much pleased at his external appearance I addressed him in the following words as well as I can remember Sir I understand you are desirous of purchasing slaves With a very pleasant smile he replied Yes I do want to buy some are you for sale Yes sir with my wife and one child Garrison had given me a note to show wherever I went that I was for sale speaking of my wife and child giving us a very good character of course and I handed him the note After reading it over he remarked I have a few questions to ask you and if you will tell me the truth like a good boy perhaps I may buy you with your family In the first place my boy you are a little too near white I want you to tell me now whether you can read or write My reply was in the negative Now I want you to tell we whether you have run away Don't tell me no stories now like a good fellow and perhaps I may buy you But as I was not under oath to tell him the whole truth I only gave him a part of it by telling him that I had run away once He appeared to be pleased at that but cautioned me to tell him the truth and asked me how long I stayed away when I run off I told him that I was gone a month He assented to this by a bow of his head and making a long grunt saying That's right tell me the truth like a good boy The whole truth was that I had been off in the state of Ohio and other free states and even to Canada besides this I was notorious for running away from my boyhood I never told him that I had been a runaway longer than one month neither did I tell him that I had not run away more than once in my life for these questions he never asked me I afterwards found him to be one of the basest hypocrites that I ever saw He looked like a saint talked like the best of slave holding Christians and acted at home like the devil When he saw my wife and child he concluded to buy us He paid for me twelve hundred dollars and one thousand for my wife and child He also bought several other slaves at the same time and took home with him His residence was in the parish of Claiborn fifty miles up from the mouth of Red River When we arrived there we found his slaves poor ragged stupid and half starved The food he allowed them per week was one peck of corn for each grown person one pound of pork and sometimes a molasses This was all that they were allowed and if they got more they stole it He had one of the most cruel overseers to be found in that section of country He weighed and measured out to them their week's allowance of food very Sabbath morning The overseer's horn was sounded two hours before daylight for them in the morning in order that they should be ready for work before daylight They were worked from daylight until after dark without stopping but one half hour to eat or rest which was at noon And at the busy season of the year they were compelled to work just as hard on the Sabbath as on any other day Illustration X Cruel treatment on Whitfield's farm Exposure of the Children Mode of extorting extra labor Neglect of the sick Strange medicine used Death of our second child My first impressions when I arrived on the Deacon's farm were that he was far more like what the people call the devil than he was like a deacon Not many days after my arrival there I heard the Deacon tell one of the slave girls that he had bought her for a wife for his boy Stephen which office he compelled her fully to perform against her will This he enforced by a threat At first the poor girl neglected to do this having no sort of affection for the man but she was finally forced to it by an application of the driver's lash as threatened by the Deacon The next thing I observed was that he made the slave driver strip his own wife and flog her for not doing just as her master had ordered He had a white overseer and a colored man for a driver whose business it was to watch and drive the slaves in the field and do the flogging according orders of the overseer Next a mulatto girl who waited about the house on her mistress displeased her for which the Deacon stripped and tied her up He then handed the lash and ordered me to put it on but I told him I never had done the like and hoped he would not compel me to do it He then informed me that I was to be his overseer and that he had bought me for that purpose He was paying a man eight hundred dollars a year to oversee and he believed I was competent to do the same business and if I would do it up right he would put nothing harder on me to do and if I knew not how to flog a slave he would set me an example by which I might be governed He then commenced on this poor girl and gave her two hundred lashes before he had her untied Illustration Illustration After giving her fifty lashes he stopped and lectured her awhile asking her if she thought that she could obey her mistress c She promised to do all in her power to please him and her mistress if he would have mercy on her But this plea was all vain He commenced on her again and this flogging was carried on in the most inhuman manner until she had received two hundred stripes on her naked quivering flesh tied up and exposed to the public gaze of all And this was the example that I was to copy after He then compelled me to wash her back off with strong salt brine before she was untied which was so revolting to my feelings that I could not refrain from shedding tears For some cause he never called on me again to flog a slave I presume he saw that I was not savage enough The above were about the first items of the Deacon's conduct which struck me with peculiar disgust After having enjoyed the blessings of civil and religious liberty for a season to be dragged into that horrible place with my family to linger out my existence without the aid of religious societies or the light of revelation was more than I could endure I really felt as if I had got into one of the darkest corners of the earth I thought I was almost out of humanity's reach and should never again have the pleasure of hearing the gospel sound as I could see no way by which I could extricate myself yet I never omitted to pray for deliverance I had faith to believe that the Lord could see our wrongs and hear our cries I was not used quite as bad as the regular field hands as the greater part of my time was spent working about the house and my wife was the cook This country was full of pine timber and every slave had to prepare a light wood torch over night made of pine knots to meet the overseer with before daylight in the morning Each person had to have his torch lit and come with it in his hand to the gin house before the overseer and driver so as to be ready to go to the cotton field by the time they could see to pick out cotton These lights looked beautiful at a distance The object of blowing the horn for them two hours before day was that they should get their bite to eat before they went to the field that they need not stop to eat but once during the day Another object was to do up their flogging which had been omitted over night I have often heard the sound of the slave driver's lash on the backs of the slaves and their heart rending shrieks which were enough to melt the heart of humanity even among the most barbarous nations of the earth But the Deacon would keep no overseer on his plantation who neglected to perform this every morning I have heard him say that he was no better pleased than when he could hear the overseer's loud complaining voice long before daylight in the morning and the sound of the driver's lash among the toiling slaves Illustration Oh my child my child This was a very warm climate abounding with musquitoes galinippers and other insects which were exceedingly annoying to the poor slaves by night and day at their quarters and in the field But more especially to their helpless little children which they had to carry with them to the cotton fields where they had to set on the damp ground alone from morning till night exposed to the scorching rays of the sun liable to be bitten by poisonous rattle snakes which are plenty in that section of the country or to be devoured by large alligators which are often seen creeping through the cotton fields going from swamp to swamp seeking their prey The cotton planters generally never allow a slave mother time to go to the house or quarter during the day to nurse her child hence they have to carry them to the cotton fields and tie them in the shade of a tree or in clusters of high weeds about in the fields where they can go to them at noon when they are allowed to stop work for one half hour This is the reason why so very few slave children are raised on these cotton plantations mothers have no time to take care of them and they are often found dead in the field and in the quarter for want of the care of their mothers But I never was eye witness to a case of this kind but have heard many narrated by my slave brothers and sisters some of which occurred on the deacon's plantation Their plan of getting quantities of cotton picked is not only to extort it from them by the lash but hold out an inducement and deceive them by giving small prizes For example the overseer will offer something worth one or two dollars to any slave who will pick out the most cotton in one day dividing the hands off in three classes and offering a prize to the one who will pick out the most cotton in each of the classes By this means they are all interested in trying to get the prize After making them try it over several times and weighing what cotton they pick every night the overseer can tell just how much every hand can pick He then gives the present to those that pick the most cotton and then if they do not pick just as much afterward they are flogged I have known the slaves to be so much fatigued from labor that they could scarcely get to their lodging places from the field at night And then they would have to prepare something to eat before they could lie down to rest Their corn they had to grind on a hand mill for bread stuff or pound it in a mortar and by the time they would get their suppers it would be midnight then they would herd down all together and take but two or three hours rest before the overseer's horn called them up again to prepare for the field At the time of sickness among slaves they had but very little attention The master was to be the judge of their sickness but never had studied the medical profession He always pronounced a slave who said he was sick a liar and a hypocrite said there was nothing the matter and he only wanted to keep from work His remedy was most generally strong red pepper tea boiled till it was red He would make them drink a pint cup full of it at one dose If he should not get better very soon after it the dose was repeated If that should not accomplish the object for which it was given or have the desired effect a pot or kettle was then put over the fire with a large quantity of chimney soot which was boiled down until it was as strong as the juice of tobacco and the poor sick slave was compelled to drink a quart of it This would operate on the system like salts or castor oil But if the slave should not be very ill he would rather work as long as he could stand up than to take this dreadful medicine If it should be a very valuable slave sometimes a physician was sent for and something done to save him But no special aid is afforded the suffering slave even in the last trying hour when he is called to grapple with the grim monster death He has no Bible no family altar no minister to address to him the consolations of the gospel before he launches into the spirit world As to the burial of slaves but very little more care is taken of their dead bodies than if they were dumb beasts My wife was very sick while we were both living with the Deacon We expected every day would be her last While she was sick we lost our second child and I was compelled to dig my own child's grave and bury it myself without even a box to put it in XI I attend a prayer meeting Punishment therefor threatened I attempt to escape alone My return to take my family Our sufferings Dreadful attack of wolves Our recapture SOME months after Malinda had recovered from her sickness I got permission from the Deacon on one Sabbath day to attend a prayer meeting on a neighboring plantation with a few old superanuated slaves although this was contrary to the custom of the country for slaves were not allowed to assemble for religious worship Being more numerous than the whites there was fear of rebellion and the overpowering of their oppressors in order to obtain freedom But this gentleman on whose plantation I attended the meeting was not a Deacon nor a professor of religion He was not afraid of a few old Christian slaves rising up to kill their master because he allowed them to worship God on the Sabbath day We had a very good meeting although our exercises were not conducted in accordance with an enlightened Christianity for we had no Bible no intelligent leader but a conscience prompted by our own reason constrained us to worship God the Creator of all things When I returned home from meeting I told the other slaves what a good time we had at our meeting and requested them to go with me to meeting thereon the next Sabbath As no slave was allowed to go from the plantation on a visit without a written pass from his master on the next Sabbath several of us went to the Deacon to get permission to attend that prayer meeting but he refused to let any go I thought I would slip off and attend the meeting and get back before he would miss me and would not know that I had been to the meeting When I returned home from the meeting as I approached the house I saw Malinda standing out at the fence looking in the direction in which I was expected to return She hailed my approach not with joy but with grief She was weeping under great distress of mind but it was hard for me to extort from her the reason why she wept She finally in formed me that her master had found out that I had violated his law and I should suffer the penalty which was five hundred lashes on my naked back I asked her how he knew that I had gone She said I had not long been gone before he called for me and I was not to be found He then sent the overseer on horseback to the place where we were to meet to see if I was there But when the overseer got to the place the meeting was over and I had gone back home but had gone a nearer route through the woods and the overseer happened not to meet me He heard that I had been there and hurried back home before me and told the Deacon who ordered him to take me on the next morning strip off my clothes drive down four stakes in the ground and fasten my limbs to them then strike me five hundred lashes for going to the prayer meeting This was what distressed my poor companion She thought it was more than I could bear and that it would be the death of me I concluded then to run away but she thought they would catch me with the blood hounds by their taking my track But to avoid them I thought I would ride off on one of the Deacon's mules She thought if I did they would sell me No matter I will try it said I let the consequences be what they may The matter can be no worse than it now is So I tackled up the Deacon's best mule with his saddle c and started that night and went off eight or ten miles from home But I found the mule to be rather troublesome and was like to betray me by braying especially when he would see cattle horses or any thing of the kind in the woods The second night from home I camped in a cane break down in the Red river swamp not a great way off from the road perhaps not twenty rods exposed to wild ferocious beasts which were numerous in that section of country On that night about the middle of the night the mule heard the sound of horses feet on the road and he commenced stamping and trying to break away As the horses seemed to come nearer the mule commenced trying to bray and it was all that I could do to prevent him from making a loud bray there in the woods which would have betrayed me I supposed that it was the overseer out with the dogs looking for me and I found afterwards that I was not mistaken As soon as the people had passed by I mounted the mule and took him home to prevent his betraying me When I got near by home I stripped off the tackling and turned the mule loose I then slipt up to the cabin wherein my wife laid and found her awake much distressed about me She informed me that they were then out looking for me and that the Deacon was bent on flogging me nearly to death and then selling me off from my family This was truly heart rending to my poor wife the thought of our being torn apart in a strange land after having been sold away from all her friends and relations was more than she could bear The Deacon had declared that I should not only suffer for the crime of attending a prayer meeting without his permission and for running away but for the awful crime of stealing a jackass which was death by the law when committed by a negro But I well knew that I was regarded as property and so was the ass and I thought if one piece of property took off another there could be no law violated in the act no more sin committed in this than if one jackass had rode off another But after consultation with my wife I concluded to take her and my little daughter with me and they would be guilty of the same crime that I was so far as running away was concerned and if the Deacon sold one he might sell us all and perhaps to the same person So we started off with our child that night and made our way down to the Red river swamps among the buzzing insects and wild beasts of the forest We wandered about in the wilderness for eight or ten days before we were apprehended striving to make our way from slavery but it was all in vain Our food was parched corn with wild fruit such as pawpaws percimmons grapes c We did at one time chance to find a sweet potato patch where we got a few potatoes but most of the time while we were out we were lost We wanted to cross the Red river but could find no conveyance to cross in I recollect one day of finding a crooked tree which bent over the river or over one fork of the river where it was divided by an island I should think that the tree was at least twenty feet from the surface of the water I picked up my little child and my wife followed me saying if we perish let us all perish together in the stream We succeeded in crossing over I often look back to that dangerous event even now with astonishment and wonder how I could have run such a risk What would induce me to run the same risk now What could induce me now to leave home and friends and go to the wild forest and lay out on the cold ground night after night without covering and live on parched corn What would induce me to take my family and go into the Red river swamps of Louisiana among the snakes and alligators with all the liabilities of being destroyed by them hunted down with blood hounds or lay myself liable to be shot down like the wild beasts of the forest Nothing I say nothing but the strongest love of liberty humanity and justice to myself and family would induce me to run such a risk again When we crossed over on the tree we supposed that we had crossed over the main body of the river but we had not proceeded far on our journey before we found that we were on an Island surrounded by water on either side We made our bed that night in a pile of dry leaves which had fallen from off the trees We were much rest broken wearied from hunger and travelling through briers swamps and cane brakes consequently we soon fell asleep after lying down About the dead hour of the night I was aroused by the awful howling of a gang of blood thirsty wolves which had found us out and surrounded us as their prey there in the dark wilderness many miles from any house or settlement My dear little child was so dreadfully alarmed that she screamed loudly with fear my wife trembling like a leaf on a tree at the thought of being devoured there in the wilderness by ferocious wolves The wolves kept howling and were near enough for us to see their glaring eyes and hear their chattering teeth I then thought that the hour of death for us was at hand that we should not live to see the light of another day for there was no way for our escape My little family were looking up to me for protection but I could afford them none And while I was offering up my prayers to that God who never forsakes those in the hour of Illustration danger who trust in him I thought of Deacon Whitfield I thought of his profession and doubted his piety I thought of his hand cuffs of his whips of his chains of his stocks of his thumb screws of his slave driver and overseer and of his religion I also thought of his opposition to prayer meetings and of his five hundred lashes promised me for attending a prayer meeting I thought of God thought of the devil I thought of hell and I thought of heaven and wondered whether I should ever see the Deacon there And I calculated that if heaven was made up of such Deacons or such persons it could not be filled with love to all mankind and with glory and eternal happiness as we know it is from the truth of the Bible The reader may perhaps think me tedious on this topic but indeed it is one of so much interest to me that I find myself entirely unable to describe what my own feelings were at that time I was so much excited by the fierce howling of the savage wolves and the frightful screams of my little family that I thought of the future I thought of the past I thought the time of my departure had come at last My impression is that all these thoughts and thousands of others flashed through my mind while I was surrounded by those wolves But it seemed to be the will of a merciful providence that our lives should be spared and that we should not be destroyed by them I had no weapon of defence but a long bowie knife which I had slipped from the Deacon It was a very splendid blade about two feet in length and about two inches in width This used to be a part of his armor of defence while walking about the plantation among his slaves The plan which I took to expel the wolves was a very dangerous one but it proved effectual While they were advancing to me prancing and accumulating in number apparently of all sizes and grades who had come to the feast I thought just at this time that there was no alternative left but for me to make a charge with my bowie knife I well knew from the action of the wolves that if I made no farther resistance they would soon destroy us and if I made a break at them the matter could be no worse I thought if I must die I would die striving to protect my little family from destruction die striving to escape from slavery My wife took a club in one hand and her child in the other while I rushed forth with my bowie knife in hand to fight off the savage wolves I made one desperate charge at them and at the same time making a loud yell at the top of my voice that caused them to retreat and scatter which was equivalent to a victory on our part Our prayers were answered and our lives spared through the night We slept no more that night and the next morning there were no wolves to be seen or heard and we resolved not to stay on that island another night We travelled up and down the river side trying to find a place where we could cross FinalIy we found a lot of drift wood clogged together extending across the stream at a narrow place in the river upon which we crossed over But we had not yet surmounted our greatest difficulty We had to meet one which was far more formidable than the first Not many days after I had to face the Deacon We had been wandering about through the cane brakes bushes and briers for several days when we heard the yelping of blood hounds a great way off but they seemed to come nearer and nearer to us We thought after awhile that they must be on our track we listened attentively at the approach We knew it was no use for us to undertake to escape from them and as they drew nigh we heard the voice of a man hissing on the dogs After awhile we saw the hounds coming in full speed on our track and the soul drivers close after them on horse back yelling like tigers as they came in sight The shrill yelling of the savage blood hounds as they drew nigh made the woods echo The first impulse was to run to escape the approaching danger of ferocious dogs and blood thirsty slave hunters who were so rapidly approaching me with loaded muskets and bowie knives with a determination to kill or capture me and my family I started to run with my little daughter in arms but stumbled and fell down and scratched the arm of little Frances with a brier so that it bled very much but the dear child never cried for she seemed to know the danger to which we were exposed But we soon found that it was no use for us to run The dogs were soon at our heels and we were compelled to stop or be torn to pieces by them Illustration Illustration By this time the soul drivers came charging up on their horses commanding us to stand still or they would shoot us down Of course I surrendered up for the sake of my family The most abusive terms to be found in the English language were poured forth on us with bitter oaths They tied my hands behind me and drove us home before them to suffer the penalty of a slaveholder's broken law As we drew nigh the plantation my heart grew faint I was aware that we should have to suffer almost death for running off I was filled with dreadful apprehensions at the thought of meeting a professed follower of Christ whom I knew to be a hypocrite No tongue no pen can ever describe what my feelings were at that time XII My sad condition before Whitfield My terrible punishment Incidents of a former attempt to escape Jack at a farm house Six pigs and turkey Our surprise and arrest THE reader may perhaps imagine what must have been my feelings when I found myself surrounded on the island with my little family at midnight by a gang of savage wolves This was one of those trying emergencies in my life when there was apparently but one step between us and the grave But I had no cords wrapped about my limbs to prevent my struggling against the impending danger to which I was then exposed I was not denied the consolation of resisting in self defence as was now the case There was no Deacon standing before me with a loaded rifle swearing that I should submit to the torturing lash or be shot down like a dumb beast I felt that my chance was by far better among the howling wolves in the Red river swamp than before Deacon Whitfield on the cotton plantation I was brought before him as a criminal before a bar without counsel to be tried and condemned by a tyrant's law My arms were bound with a cord broken and my little family standing by weeping I was not allowed to plead my own cause and there was no one to utter a word in my behalf He ordered that the field hands should be called together to witness my punishment that it might serve as a caution to them never to attend a prayer meeting or runaway as I had lest they should receive the same punishment At the sound of the overseer's horn all the slaves came forward and witnessed my punishment My clothing was stripped off and I was compelled to lie down on the ground with my face to the earth Four stakes were driven in the ground to which my hands and feet were tied Then the overseer stood over me with the lash and laid it on according to the Deacon's order Fifty lashes were laid on before stopping I was then lectured with reference to my going to prayer meeting without his orders and running away to escape flogging While I suffered under this dreadful torture I prayed and wept and implored mercy at the hand of slavery but found none After I was marked from my neck to my heels the Deacon took the gory lash and said he thought there was a spot on my back yet where he could put in a few more He wanted to give me something to remember him by he said After I was flogged almost to death in this way a paddle was brought forward and eight or ten blows given me with it which was by far worse than the lash My wounds were then washed with salt brine after which I was let up A description of such paddles I have already given in another I Illustration Illustration was so badly punished that I was not able to work for several days After being flogged as described they took me off several miles to a shop and had a heavy iron collar riveted on my neck with prongs extending above my head on the end of which there was a small bell I was not able to reach the bell with my hand This heavy load of iron I was compelled to wear for six weeks I never was allowed to lie in the same house with my family again while I was the slave of Whitfield I either had to sleep with my feet in the stocks or be chained with a large log chain to a log over night with no bed or bedding to rest my wearied limbs on after toiling all day in the cotton field I suffered almost death while kept in this confinement and he had ordered the overseer never to let me loose again saying that I thought of getting free by running off but no negro should ever get away from him alive I have omitted to state that this was the second time I had run away from him while I was gone the first time he extorted from my wife the fact that I had been in the habit of running away before we left Kentucky that I had been to Canada and that I was trying to learn the art of reading and writing All this was against me It is true I was striving to learn myself to write I was a kind of a house servant and was frequently sent off on errands but never without a written pass and on Sundays I have sometimes got permission to visit our neighbor's slaves and I have often tried to write myself a pass Whenever I got hold of an old letter that had been thrown away or a piece of white paper I would save it to write on I have often gone off in the woods and spent the greater part of the day alone trying to learn to write myself a pass by writing on the backs of old letters copying after the pass that had been written by Whitfield by so doing I got the use of the pen and could form letters as well as I can now but knew not what they were The Deacon had an old slave by the name of Jack whom he bought about the time that he bought me Jack was born in the State of Virginia He had some idea of freedom had often run away but was very ignorant knew not where to go for refuge but understood all about providing something to eat when unjustly deprived of it So for ill treatment we concluded to take a tramp together I was to be the pilot while Jack was to carry the baggage and keep us in provisions Before we started I managed to get hold of a suit of clothes the Deacon possessed with his gun ammunition and bowie knife We also procured a blanket a joint of meat and some bread We started in a northern direction being bound for the city of Little Rock State of Arkansas We travelled by night and laid by in the day being guided by the unchangeable North Star but at length our provisions gave out and it was Jack's place to get more We came in sight of a large plantation one morning where we saw people of color and Jack said he could get something there among the slaves that night for us to eat So we concealed ourselves in sight of this plantation until about bed time when we saw the lights extinguished During the day we saw a female slave passing from the dwelling house to the kitchen as if she was the cook the house being about three rods from the landlord's dwelling After we supposed the whites were all asleep Jack slipped up softly to the kitchen to try his luck with the cook to see if he could get any thing from her to eat I would remark that the domestic slaves are often found to be traitors to their own people for the purpose of gaining favor with their masters and they are encouraged and trained up by them to report every plot they know of being formed about stealing any thing or running away or any thing of the kind and for which they are paid This is one of the principal causes of the slaves being divided among themselves and without which they could not be held in bondage one year and perhaps not half that time I now proceed to describe the unsuccessful attempt of poor Jack to obtain something from the female slave to satisfy hunger The planter's house was situated on an elevated spot on the side of a hill The fencing about the house and garden was very crookedly laid up with rails The night was rather dark and rainy and Jack left me with the understanding that I was to stay at a certain place until he returned I cautioned him before he left me to be very careful and after he started I left the place where he was going to find me when he returned for fear something might happen which might lead to my detection should I remain at that spot So I left it and went off where I could see the house and that place too Jack had not long been gone before I heard a great noise a man crying out with a loud voice Catch him Catch him and hissing the dogs on and they were close after Jack The next thing I saw was Jack running for life and an old white man after him with a gun and his dogs The fence being on sidling ground and wet with the rain when Jack run against it he knocked down several pannels of it and fell tumbling over and over to the foot of the hill but soon recovered and ran to where he had left me but I was gone The dogs were still after him There happened to be quite a thicket of small oak shrubs and bushes in the direction he ran I think he might have been heard running and straddling bushes a quarter of a mile The poor fellow hurt himself considerably in straddling over bushes in that way in making his escape Finally the dogs relaxed their chase and poor Jack and myself again met in the thick forest He said when he rapped on the cook house door the colored woman came to the door He asked her if she would let him have a bite of bread if she had it that he was a poor hungry absconding slave But she made no reply to what he said but immediately sounded the alarm by calling loudly after her master saying here is a runaway negro Jack said that he was going to knock her down but her master was out within one moment and he had to run for his life As soon as we got our eyes fixed on the North Star again we started on our way We travelled on a few miles and came to another large plantation where Jack was determined to get something to eat He left me at a certain place while he went up to the house to find something if possible He was gone some time before he returned but when I saw him coming he appeared to be very heavy loaded with a bag of something We walked off pretty fast until we got some distance in the woods Jack then stopped and opened his bag in which he had six small pigs I asked him how he got them without making any noise and he said that he found a bed of hogs in which there were the pigs with their mother While the pigs were sucking he crawled up to them without being discovered by the sow and took them by their necks one after another and choked them to death and slipped them into his bag We intended to travel on all that night and lay by the next day in the forest and cook up our pigs We fell into a large road leading on the direction which we were travelling and had not proceeded over three miles before I found a white hat in the road before me Jack being a little behind me I stopped until he came up and showed it to him He picked it up We looked a few steps farther and saw a man lying by the way either asleep or intoxicated as we supposed I told Jack not to take the hat but he would not obey me He had only a piece of a hat himself which he left in exchange for the other We travelled on about five miles farther and in passing a house discovered a large turkey sitting on the fence which temptation was greater than Jack could resist Notwithstanding he had six very nice fat little pigs on his back he stepped up and took the turkey off the fence By this time it was getting near day light and we left the road and went off a mile or so among the hills of the forest where we struck camp for the day We then picked our turkey dressed our pigs and cooked two of them We got the hair off by singeing them over the fire and after we had eaten all we wanted one of us slept while the other watched We had flint punk and powder to strike fire with A little after dark the next night we started on our way But about ten o'clock that night just as we were passing through a thick skirt of woods five men sprang out before us with fire arms swearing if we moved another step they would shoot us down and each man having his gun drawn up for shooting we had no chance to make any defence and surrendered sooner than run the risk of being killed They had been lying in wait for us there for several hours They had seen a reward out for notices were put up in the most public places that fifty dollars would be paid for me dead or alive if I should not return home within so many days And the reader will remember that neither Jack nor myself was able to read the advertisement It was of very little consequence with the slave catchers whether they killed us or took us alive for the reward was the same to them Illustration Illustration After we were taken and tied one of the men declared to me that he would have shot me dead just as sure as he lived if I had moved one step after they commanded us to stop He had his gun levelled at my breast already cocked and his finger on the trigger The way they came to find us out was from the circumstance of Jack's taking the man's hat in connection with the advertisement The man whose hat was taken was drunk and the next morning when he came to look for his hat it was gone and Jack's old hat lying in the place of it and in looking round he saw the tracks of two persons in the dust who had passed during the night and one of them having but three toes on one foot He followed these tracks until they came to a large mud pond in a lane on one side of which a person might pass dry shod but the man with three toes on one foot had plunged through the mud This led the man to think there must be runaway slaves and from out of that neighborhood for all persons in that settlement knew which side of that mud hole to go He then got others to go with him and they followed us until our track left the road They supposed that we had gone off in the woods to lay by until night after which we should pursue our course After we were captured they took us off several miles to where one of them lived and kept us over night One of our pigs was cooked for us to eat that night and the turkey the next morning But we were both tied that night with our hands behind us and our feet were also tied The doors were looked and a bedstead was set against the front door and two men slept in it to prevent our getting out in the night They said that they knew how to catch runaway negroes and how to keep them after they were caught They remarked that after they found we had stopped to lay by until night and they saw from our tracks what direction we were travelling they went about ten miles on that direction and hid by the road side until we came up that night That night after all had got fast to sleep I thought I would try to get out and I should have succeeded if I could have moved the bed from the door I managed to untie myself and crawled under the bed which was placed at the door and strove to remove it but in so doing I awakened the men and they got up and confined me again and watched me until day light each with a gun in hand The next morning they started with us back to Deacon Whitfield's plantation but when they got within ten miles of where he lived they stopped at a public house to stay over night and who should we meet there but the Deacon who was then out looking for me The reader may well imagine how I felt to meet him I had almost as soon come in contact with Satan himself He had two long poles or sticks of wood brought into confine us to I was compelled to lie on my back across one of those sticks with my arms out and have them lashed fast to the log with a cord My feet were also tied to the other and there I had to lie all that night with my back across this stick of wood and my feet and bands tied I suffered that night under the most excruciating pain From the tight binding of the cord the circulation of the blood in my arms and feet was almost entirely stopped If the night had been much longer I must have died in that confinement The next morning we were taken back to the Deacon's farm and both flogged for going off and set to work But there was some allowance made me on account of my being young They said they knew old Jack had pursuaded me off or I never would have gone And the Deacon's wife begged that I might be favored some for that time as Jack had influenced me so as to bring up my old habits of running away that I had entirely given up XIII I am sold to gamblers They try to purchase my family Our parting scene My good usage I am sold to an Indian His confidence in my integrity manifested THE reader will remember that this brings me back to the time the Deacon had ordered me to be kept in confinement until he got a chance to sell me and that no negro should ever get away from him and live Some days after this we were all out at the gin house ginning cotton which was situated on the road side and there came along a company of men fifteen or twenty in number who were Southern sportsmen Their attention was attracted by the load of iron which was fastened about my neck with a bell attached They stopped and asked the Deacon what that bell was put on my neck for and he said it was to keep me from running away c They remarked that I looked as if I might be a smart negro and asked if he wanted to sell me The reply was yes They then got off their horses and struck a bargain with him for me They bought me at a reduced price for speculation After they had purchased me I asked the privilege of going to the house to take leave of my family before I left which was granted by the sportsmen But the Deacon said I should never again step my foot inside of his yard and advised the sportsmen not to take the irons from my neck until they had sold me that if they gave me the least chance I would run away from them as I did from him So I was compelled to mount a horse and go off with them as I supposed never again to meet my family in this life We had not proceeded far before they informed me that they had bought me to sell again and if they kept the irons on me it would be detrimental to the sale and that they would therefore take off the irons and dress me up like a man and throw away the old rubbish which I then had on and they would sell me to some one who would treat me better than Deacon Whitfield After they had cut off the irons and dressed me up they crossed over Red River into Texas where they spent some time horse racing and gambling and although they were wicked black legs of the basest character it is but due to them to say that they used me far better than ever the Deacon did They gave me plenty to eat and put nothing hard on me to do They expressed much sympathy for me in my bereavement and almost every day they gave me money more or less and by my activity in waiting on them and upright conduct I got into the good graces of them all but they could not get any person to buy me an account of the amount of intelligence which they supposed me to have for many of them thought that I could read and write When they left Texas they intended to go to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi to attend a great horse race which was to take place Not being much out of their way to go past Deacon Whitfield's again I prevailed on them to call on him for the purpose of trying to purchase my wife and child and I promised them that if they would buy my wife and child I would get some person to purchase us from them So they tried to grant my request by calling on the Deacon and trying to make the purchase As we approached the Deacon's plantation my heart was filled with a thousand painful and fearful apprehensions I had the fullest confidence in the blacklegs with whom I travelled believing that they would do according to promise and go to the fullest extent of their ability to restore peace and consolation to a bereaved family to re unite husband and wife parent and child who had long been severed by slavery through the agency of Deacon Whitfield But I knew his determination in relation to myself and I feared his wicked opposition to a restoration of myself and little family which he had divided and soon found that my fears were not without foundation When we rode up and walked into his yard the Deacon came out and spoke to all but myself and not finding me in tattered rags as a substitute for clothes nor having an iron collar bell about my neck as was the case when he sold me he appeared to be much displeased What did you bring that negro back here for said he We have come to try to buy his wife and child for we can find no one who is willing to buy him alone and we will either buy or sell so that the family may be together said they While this conversation was going on my poor bereaved wife who never expected to see me again in this life spied me and came rushing to me through the crowd throwing her arms about my neck exclaiming in the most sympathetic tones Oh my dear husband I never expected to see you again The poor woman was bathed with tears of sorrow and grief But no sooner had she reached me than the Deacon peremptorily commanded her to go to her work This she did not obey but prayed that her master would not separate us again as she was there alone far from friends and relations whom she should never meet again And now to take away her husband her last and only true friend would be like taking her life But such appeals made no impression on the unfeeling Deacon's heart While he was storming with abusive language and even using the gory lash with hellish vengeance to separate husband and wife I could see the sympathetic tear drop stealing its way down the cheek of the profligate and black leg whose object it now was to bind up the broken heart of a wife and restore to the arms of a bereaved husband his companion They were disgusted at the conduct of Whitfield and cried out shame even in his presence They told him that they would give a thousand dollars for my wife and child or any thing in reason But no he would sooner see me to the devil than indulge or gratify me after my having run away from him and if they did not remove me from his presence very soon he said he should make them suffer for it But all this and even the gory lash had yet failed to break the grasp of poor Malinda whose prospect of connubial social and future happiness was all at stake When the dear woman saw there was no help for us and that we should soon be separated forever in the name of Deacon Whitfield and American slavery to meet no more as husband and wife parent and child the last and loudest appeal was made on our knees We appealed to the God of justice and to the sacred ties of humanity but this was all in vain The louder we prayed the harder he whipped amid the most heart rending shrieks from the poor slave mother and child as little Frances stood by sobbing at the abuse inflicted on her mother Oh how shall I give my husband the parting hand never to meet again This will surely break my heart were her parting words I can never describe to the reader the awful reality of that separation for it was enough to chill the blood and stir up the deepest feeling of revenge in the hearts of slaveholding black legs who as they stood by were threatening some weeping some swearing and others declaring vengeance against such treatment being inflicted on a human being As we left the plantation as far as we could see and hear the Deacon was still laying on the gory lash trying to prevent poor Malinda from weeping over the loss of her departed husband who was then by the hellish laws of slavery to her theoretically and Illustration Oh how shall I give my husband the parting hand never to meet again practically dead One of the black legs exclaimed that hell was full of just such Deacon's as Whitfield This occurred in December I have never seen Malinda since that period I never expect to see her again The sportsmen to whom I was sold showed their sympathy for me not only by word but by deeds They said that they had made the most liberal offer to Whitfield to buy or sell for the sole purpose of reuniting husband and wife But he stood out against it they felt sorry for me They said they had bought me to speculate on and were not able to lose what they had paid for me But they would make a bargain with me if I was willing and would lay a plan by which I might yet get free If I would use my influence so as to get some person to buy me while traveling about with them they would give me a portion of the money for which they sold me and they would also give me directions by which I might yet run away and go to Canada This offer I accepted and the plot was made They advised me to act very stupid in language and thought but in business I must be spry and that I must persuade men to buy me and promise them that I would be smart We passed through the State of Arkansas and stopped at many places horse racing and gambling My business was to drive a wagon in which they carried their gambling apparatus clothing c I had also to black boots and attend to horses We stopped at Fayettville where they almost lost me betting on a horse race They went from thence to the Indian Territory among the Cherokee Indians to attend the great races which were to take place there During the races there was a very wealthy half Indian of that tribe who became much attached to me and had some notion of buying me after hearing that I was for sale being a slaveholder The idea struck me rather favorable for several reasons First I thought I should stand a better chance to get away from an Indian than from a white man Second he wanted me only for a kind of a body servant to wait on him and in this case I knew that I should fare better than I should in the field And my owners also told me that it would be an easy place to get away from I took their advice for fear I might not get another chance so good as that and prevailed on the man to buy me He paid them nine hundred dollars in gold and silver for me I saw the money counted out After the purchase was made the sportsmen got me off to one side and according to promise they gave me a part of the money and directions how to get from there to Canada They also advised me how to act until I got a good chance to run away I was to embrace the earliest opportunity of getting away before they should become acquainted with me I was never to let it be known where I was from nor where I was born I was to act quite stupid and ignorant And when I started I was to go up the boundary line between the Indian Territory and the States of Arkansas and Missouri and this would fetch me out on the Missouri river near Jefferson city the capital of Missouri I was to travel at first by night and to lay by in daylight until I got out of danger The same afternoon that the Indian bought me he started with me to his residence which was fifty or sixty miles distant And so great was his confidence in me that he intrusted me to carry his money The amount must have been at least five hundred dollars which was all in gold and silver and when we stopped over night the money and horses were all left in my charge It would have been a very easy matter for me to have taken one of the best horses with the money and run off And the temptation was truly great to a man like myself who was watching for the earliest opportunity to escape and I felt confident that I should never have a better opportunity to escape full handed than then XIV Character of my Indian Master Slavery among the Indians less cruel Indian carousal Enfeebled health of my Indian Master His death My escape Adventure in a wigwam Successful progress toward liberty THE next morning I went home with my new master and by the way it is only doing justice to the dead to say that he was the most reasonable and humane slaveholder that I have ever belonged to He was the last man that pretended to claim property in my person and although I have freely given the names and residences of all others who have held me as a slave for prudential reasons I shall omit giving the name of this individual He was the owner of a large plantation and quite a number of slaves He raised corn and wheat for his own consumption only There was no cotton tobacco or anything of the kind produced among them for market And I found this difference between negro slavery among the Indians and the same thing among the white slaveholders of the South The Indians allow their slaves enough to eat and wear They have no overseers to whip nor drive them If a slave offends his master he sometimes in a heat of passion undertakes to chastise him but it is as often the case as otherwise that the slave gets the better of the fight and even flogs his master This singular fact is corroborated in a letter read by the publisher from an acquaintance while passing through this country in for which there is no law to punish him but when the fight is over that is the last of it So far as religious instruction is concerned they have it on terms of equality the bond and the free they have no respect of persons they have neither slave laws nor negro pews Neither do they separate husbands and wives nor parents and children All things considered if I must be a slave I had by far rather be a slave to an Indian than to a white man from the experience I have had with both A majority of the Indians were uneducated and still followed up their old heathen traditional notions They made it a rule to have an Indian dance or frolic about once a fortnight and they would come together far and near to attend these dances They would most generally commence about the middle of the afternoon and would give notice by the blowing of horns One would commence blowing and another would answer and so it would go all round the neighborhood When a number had got together they would strike a circle about twenty rods in circumference and kindle up fires about twenty feet apart all around in this circle In the centre they would have a large fire to dance around and at each one of the small fires there would be a squaw to keep up the fire which looked delightful off at a distance But the most degrading practice of all was the use of intoxicating drinks which were used to a great excess by all that attended these stump dances At almost all of these fires there was some one with rum to sell There would be some dancing some singing some gambling some fighting and some yelling and this was kept up often for two days and nights together Their dress for the dance was most generally a great bunch of bird feathers coon tails or something of the kind stuck in their heads and a great many shells tied about their legs to rattle while dancing Their manner of dancing is taking hold of each others hands and forming a ring around the large fire in the centre and go stomping around it until they would get drunk or their heads would get to swimming and then they would go off and drink and another set come on Such were some of the practises indulged in by these Indian slaveholders My last owner was in a declining state of health when he bought me and not long after he bought me he went off forty or fifty miles from home to be doctored by an Indian doctor accompanied by his wife I was taken along also to drive the carriage and to wait upon him during his sickness But he was then so feeble that his life was of but short duration after the doctor commenced on him While he lived I waited on him according to the best of my ability I watched over him night and day until he died and even prepared his body for the tomb before I left him He died about midnight and I understood from his friends that he was not to be buried until the second day after his death I pretended to be taking on at a great rate about his death but I was more excited about running away than I was about that and before daylight the next morning I proved it for I was on my way to Canada I never expected a better opportunity would present itself for my escape I slipped out of the room as if I had gone off to weep for the deceased knowing that they would not feel alarmed about me until after my master was buried and they had returned back to his residence And even then they would think that I was somewhere on my way home and it would be at least four or five days before they would make any stir in looking after me By that time if I had no bad luck I should be out of much danger After the first day I laid by in the day and traveled by night for several days and nights passing in this way through several tribes of Indians I kept pretty near the boundary line I recollect getting lost one dark rainy night Not being able to find the road I came into an Indian settlement at the dead hour of the night I was wet wearied cold and hungry and yet I felt afraid to enter any of their houses or wigwams not knowing whether they would be friendly or not But I knew the Indians were generally drunkards and that occasionally a drunken white man was found straggling among them and that such an one would be more likely to find friends from sympathy than an upright man So I passed myself off that night as a drunkard among them I walked up to the door of one of their houses and fell up against it making a great noise like a drunken man but no one came to the door I opened it and staggered in falling about and making a great noise But finally an old woman got up and gave me a blanket to lie down on There was quite a number of them lying about on the dirt floor but not one could talk or understand a word of the English language I made signs so as to let them know that I wanted something to eat but they had nothing so I had to go without that night I laid down and pretended to be asleep but I slept none that night for I was afraid that they would kill me if I went to sleep About one hour before day the next morning three of the females got up and put into a tin kettle a lot of ashes with water to boil and then poured into it about one quart of corn After letting it stand a few moments they poured it into a trough and pounded it into thin hominy They washed it out and boiled it down and called me up to eat my breakfast of it After eating I offered them six cents but they refused to accept it I then found my way to the main road and traveled all that day on my journey and just at night arrived at a public house kept by an Indian who also kept a store I walked in and asked if I could get lodging which was granted but I had not been there long before three men came riding up about dusk or between sunset and dark They were white men and I supposed slaveholders At any rate when they asked if they could have lodging I trembled for fear they might be in pursuit of me But the landlord told them that he could not lodge them but they could get lodging about two miles off with a white man and they turned their horses and started The landlord asked me where I was traveling to and where I was from I told him that I had been out looking at the country that I had thought of buying land and that I lived in the State of Ohio in the village of Perrysburgh He then said that he had lived there himself and that he had acted as an interpreter there among the Maumee tribe of Indians for several years He then asked who I was acquainted with there I informed him that I knew Judge Hollister Francis Hollister J W Smith and others At this he was so much pleased that he came up and took me by the hand and received me joyfully after seeing that I was acquainted with those of his old friends I could converse with him understandingly from personal acquaintance for I had lived there when I first ran away from Kentucky But I felt it to be my duty to start off the next morning before breakfast or sunrise I bought a dozen of eggs and had them boiled to carry with me to eat on the way I did not like the looks of those three men and thought I would get on as fast as possible for fear I might be pursued by them I was then about to enter the territory of another slave State Missouri I had passed through the fiery ordeal of Sibley Gatewood and Garrison and had even slipped through the fingers of Deacon Whitfield I had doubtless gone through great peril in crossing the Indian territory in passing through the various half civilized tribes who seemed to look upon me with astonishment as I passed along Their hands were almost invariably filled with bows and arrows tomahawks guns butcher knives and all the various implements of death which are used by them And what made them look still more frightful their faces were often painted red and their heads muffled with birds feathers bushes coons tails and owls heads But all this I had passed through and my long enslaved limbs and spirit were then in full stretch for emancipation I felt as if one more short struggle would set me free XV Adventure on the Prairie I borrow a horse without leave Rapid traveling one whole night Apology for using other men's horses My manner of living on the road EARLY in the morning I left the Indian territory as I have already said for fear I might be pursued by the three white men whom I had seen there over night but I had not proceeded far before my fears were magnified a hundred fold I always dreaded to pass through a prairie and on coming to one which was about six miles in width I was careful to look in every direction to see whether there was any person in sight before I entered it but I could see no one So I started across with a hope of crossing without coming in contact with any one on the prairie I walked as fast as I could but when I got about midway of the prairie I came to a high spot where the road forked and three men came up from a low spot as if they had been there concealed They were all on horse back and I supposed them to be the same men that had tried to get lodging where I stopped over night Had this been in timbered land I might have stood some chance to have dodged them but there I was out in the open prairie where I could see no possible way by which I could escape They came along slowly up behind me and finally passed and spoke or bowed their heads oil passing but they traveled in a slow walk and kept but a very few steps before me until we got nearly across the prairie When we were coming near a plantation a piece off from the road on the skirt of the timbered land they whipped up their horses and left the road as if they were going across to this plantation They soon got out of my sight by going down into a valley which lay between us and the plantation Not seeing them rise the hill to go up to the farm excited greater suspicion in my mind so I stepped over on the brow of the hill where I could see what they were doing and to my surprise I saw them going right back in the direction they had just came and they were going very fast I was then satisfied that they were after me and that they were only going back to get more help to assist them in taking me for fear that I might kill some of them if they undertook it The first impression was that I had better leave the road immediately so I bolted from the road and ran as fast as I could for some distance in the thick forest and concealed myself for about fifteen or twenty minutes which were spent in prayer to God for his protecting care and guidance My impression was that when they should start in pursuit of me again they would follow on in the direction which I was going when they left me and not finding or hearing of me on the road they would come back and hunt through the woods around and if they could find no track they might go and get dogs to trace me out I thought my chance of escape would be better if I went back to the same side of the road that they first went for the purpose of deceiving them as I supposed that they would not suspect my going in the same direction that they went for the purpose of escaping from them So I traveled all that day square off from the road through the wild forest without any knowledge of the country whatever for I had nothing to travel by but the sun by day and the moon and stars by night Just before night I came in sight of a large plantation where I saw quite a number of horses running at large in a field and knowing that my success in escaping depended upon my getting out of that settlement within twenty four hours to save myself from everlasting slavery I thought I should be justified in riding one of those horses that night if I could catch one I cut a grape vine with my knife and made it into a bridle and shortly after dark I went into the field and tried to catch one of the horses I got a bunch of dry blades of fodder and walked up softly towards the horses calling to them cope cope cope but there was only one out of the number that I was able to get my hand on and that was an old mare which I supposed to be the mother of all the rest and I knew that I could walk faster than she could travel She had a bell on and was very thin a flesh she looked gentle and walked on three legs only The young horses pranced and galloped off I was not able to get near them and the old mare being of no use to me I left them all After fixing my eyes on the north star I pursued my journey holding on to my bridle with a hope of finding a horse upon which I might ride that night I found a road leading pretty nearly in the direction which I wanted to travel and I kept it After traveling several miles I found another large plantation where there was a prospect of finding a horse I stopped up to the barn yard wherein I found several horses There was a little barn standing with the door open and I found it quite an easy task to get the horses into the barn and select out the best looking one of them I pulled down the fence led the noble beast out and mounted him taking a northern direction being able to find a road which led that way But I had not gone over three or four miles before I came to a large stream of water which was past fording yet I could see that it had been forded by the road track but from high water it was then impassible As the horse seemed willing to go in I put him through but before he got in far he was in water up to his sides and finally the water came over his back and he swam over I got as wet as could be but the horse carried me safely across at the proper place After I got out a mile or so from the river I came into a large prairie which I think must have been twenty or thirty miles in width and the road run across it about in the direction that I wanted to go I laid whip to the horse and I think he must have carried me not less than forty miles that night or before sun rise the next morning I then stopped him in a spot of high grass in an old field and took off the bridle I thanked God and thanked the horse for what he had done for me and wished him a safe journey back home I know the poor horse must have felt stiff and tired from his speedy jaunt and I felt very bad myself riding at that rate all night without a saddle but I felt as if I had too much at stake to favor either horse flesh or man flesh I could indeed afford to crucify my own flesh for the sake of redeeming myself from perpetual slavery Some may be disposed to find fault with my taking the horse as I did but I did nothing more than nine out of ten would do if they were placed in the same circumstances I had no disposition to steal a horse from any man But I ask if a white man had been captured by the Cherokee Indians and carried away from his family for life into slavery and could see a chance to escape and get back to his family should the Indians pursue him with a determination to take him back or take his life would it be a crime for the poor fugitive whose life liberty and future happiness were all at stake to mount any man's horse by the way side and ride him without asking any questions to effect his escape Or who would not do the same thing to rescue a wife child father or mother Such an act committed by a white man under the same circumstances would not only be pronounced proper but praiseworthy and if he neglected to avail himself of such a means of escape he would be pronounced a fool Therefore from this act I have nothing to regret for I have done nothing more than any other reasonable person would have done under the same circumstances But I had good luck from the morning I left the horse until I got back into the State of Ohio About two miles from where I left the horse I found a public house on the road where I stopped and took breakfast Being asked where I was traveling I replied that I was going home to Perrysburgh Ohio and that I had been out to look at the land in Missouri with a view of buying They supposed me to be a native of Ohio from the fact of my being so well acquainted with its location its principal cities inhabitants c The next night I put up at one of the best hotels in the village where I stopped and acted with as much independence as if I was worth a million of dollars talked about buying land stock and village property and contrasting it with the same kind of property in the State of Ohio In this kind of talk they were most generally interested and I was treated just like other travelers I made it a point to travel about thirty miles each day on my way to Jefferson city On several occasions I have asked the landlords where I have stopped over night if they could tell me who kept the best house where I would stop the next night which was most generally in a small village But for fear I might forget I would get them to give me the name on a piece of paper as a kind of recommend This would serve as an introduction through which I have always been well received from one landlord to another and I have always stopped at the best houses eaten at the first tables and slept in the best beds No man ever asked me whether I was bond or free black or white rich or poor but I always presented a bold front and showed the best side out which was all the pass I had But when I got within about one hundred miles of Jefferson city where I expected to take a Steamboat passage to St Louis I stopped over night at a hotel where I met with a young white man who was traveling on to Jefferson City on horse back and was also leading a horse with a saddle and bridle on I asked him if he would let me ride the horse which he was leading as I was going to the same city He said that it was a hired horse that he was paying at the rate of fifty cents per day for it but if I would pay the same I could ride him I accepted the offer and we rode together to the city We were on the road together two or three days stopped and ate and slept together at the same hotels XVI Stratagem to get on board the steamer My Irish friends My success in reaching Cincinnati Reflections on again seeing Kentucky I get employment in a hotel My fright at seeing the gambler who sold me I leave Ohio with Mr Smith His letter My education THE greatest of my adventures came off when I arrived at Jefferson City There I expected to meet an advertisement for my person it was there I must cross the river or take a steamboat down it was there I expected to be interrogated and required to prove whether I was actually a free man or a slave If I was free I should have to show my free papers and if I was a slave I should be required to tell who my master was I stopped at a hotel however and ascertained that there was a steamboat expected down the river that day for St Louis I also found out that there were several passengers at that house who were going down on board of the first boat I knew that the captain of a steamboat could not take a colored passenger on board his boat from a slave state without first ascertaining whether such person was bond or free I knew that this was more than he would dare to do by the laws of the slave states and now to surmount this difficulty it brought into exercise all the powers of my mind I would have got myself boxed up as freight and have been forwarded to St Louis but I had no friend that I could trust to do it for me This plan has since been adopted by some with success But finally I thought I might possibly pass myself off as a body servant to the passengers going from the hotel down So I went to a store and bought myself a large truck and took it to the hotel Soon a boat came in which was bound to St Louis and the passengers started down to get on board I took up my large truck and started along after them as if I was their servant My heart trembled in view of the dangerous experiment which I was then about to try It required all the moral courage that I was master of to bear me up in view of my critical condition The white people that I was following walked on board and I after them I acted as if the truck was full of clothes but I had not a stitch of clothes in it The passengers went up into the cabin and I followed them with the trunk I suppose this made the captain think that I was their slave I not only took the trunk in the cabin but stood by it until after the boat had started as if it belonged to my owners and I was taking care of it for them but as soon as the boat got fairly under way I knew that some account would have to be given of me so I took my trunk down on the deck among the deck passengers to prepare myself to meet the clerk of the boat when he should come to collect fare from the deck passengers Fortunately for me there was quite a number of deck passengers on board among whom there were many Irish I insinuated myself among them so as to get into their good graces believing that if I should get into a difficulty they would stand by me I saw several of these persons going up to the saloon buying whiskey and I thought this might be the most effectual way by which I could gain speedily their respect and sympathy So I participated with them pretty freely for awhile or at least until after I got my fare settled I placed myself in a little crowd of them and invited them all up to the bar with me stating that it was my treat This was responded to and they walked up and drank and I footed the bill This of course brought us into a kind of a union We sat together and laughed and talked freely Within ten or fifteen minutes I remarked that I was getting dry again and invited them up and treated again By this time I was thought to be one of the most liberal and gentlemanly men on board by these deck passengers they were ready to do any thing for me they got to singing songs and telling long yarns in which I took quite an active part but it was all for effect By this time the porter came around ringing his bell for all passengers who had not paid their fare to walk up to the captain's office and settle it Some of my Irish friends had not yet settled and I asked one of them if he would be good enough to take my money and get me a ticket when he was getting one for himself and he quickly replied yes sir I will get you a tacket So he relieved me of my greatest trouble When they came round to gather the tickets before we got to St Louis my ticket was taken with the rest and no questions were asked me The next day the boat arrived at St Louis my object was to take passage on board of the first boat which was destined for Cincinnati Ohio and as there was a boat going out that day for Pittsburgh I went on board to make some inquiry about the fare c and found the steward to be a colored man with whom I was acquainted He lived in Cincinnati and had rendered me some assistance in making my escape to Canada in the summer of and he also very kindly aided me then in getting back into a land of freedom The swift running steamer started that afternoon on her voyage which soon wafted my body beyond the tyrannical limits of chattel slavery When the boat struck the mouth of the river Ohio and I had once more the pleasure of looking on that lovely stream my heart leaped up for joy at the glorious prospect that I should again be free Every revolution of the mighty steam engine seemed to bring me nearer and nearer the promised land Only a few days had elapsed before I was permitted by the smiles of a good providence once more to gaze on the green hill tops and valleys of old Kentucky the State of my nativity And notwithstanding I was deeply interested while standing on the deck of the steamer looking at the beauties of nature on either side of the river as she pressed her way up the stream my very soul was pained to look upon the slaves in the fields of Kentucky still toiling under their task masters without pay It was on this soil I first breathed the free air of Heaven and felt the bitter pangs of slavery it was here that I first learned to abhor it It was here I received the first impulse of human rights it was here that I first entered my protest against the bloody institution of slavery by running away from it and declared that I would no longer work for any man as I had done without wages When the steamboat arrived at Portsmouth Ohio I took off my trunk with the intention of going to Canada But my funds were almost exhausted so I had to stop and go to work to get money to travel on I hired myself at the American Hotel to a Mr McCoy to do the work of a porter to black boots c for which he was to pay me per month I soon found the landlord to be bad pay and not only that but he would not allow me to charge for blacking boots although I had to black them after everybody had gone to bed at night and set them in the barroom where the gentlemen could come and get them in the morning while I was at other work I had nothing extra for this neither would he pay me my regular wages so I thought this was a little too much like slavery and devised a plan by which I got some pay for my work I made it a point never to blacken all the boots and shoes over night neither would I put any of them in the bar room but lock them up in a room where no one could get them without calling for me I got a piece of broken vessel placed it in the room just before the boots and put into it several pieces of small change as if it had been given me for boot blacking and almost every one that came in after their boots would throw some small trifle into my contribution box while I was there blacking away In this way I made more than my landlord paid me and I soon got a good stock of cash again One morning I blacked a gentleman's boots who came in during the night by a steamboat After he had put on his boots I was called into the bar room to button his straps and while I was performing this service not thinking to see anybody that knew me I happened to look up at the man's face and who should it be but one of the very gamblers who had recently sold me I dropped his foot and bolted from the room as if I had been struck by an electric shock The man happened not to recognize me but this strange conduct on my part excited the landlord who followed me out to see what was the matter He found me with my hand to my breast groaning at a great rate He asked me what was the matter but I was not able to inform him correctly but said that I felt very bad indeed He of course thought I was sick with the colic and ran in the house and got some hot stuff for me with spice ginger c But I never got able to go into the bar room until long after breakfast time when I knew this man was gone then I got well And yet I have no idea that the man would have hurt a hair of my head but my first thought was that he was after me I then made up my mind to leave Portsmouth its location being right on the border of a slave State A short time after this a gentleman put up there over night named Smith from Perrysburgh with whom I was acquainted in the North He was on his way to Kentucky to buy up a drove of fine horses and he wanted me to go and help him to drive his horses out to Perrysburgh and said he would pay all my expenses if I would go So I made a contract to go and agreed to meet him the next week on a set day in Washington Ky to start with his drove to the north Accordingly at the time I took a steamboat passage down to Maysville near where I was to meet Mr Smith with my trunk When I arrived at Maysville I found that Washington was still six miles back from the river I stopped at a hotel and took my breakfast and who should I see there but a captain of a boat who saw me but two years previous going down the river Ohio with handcuffs on in a chain gang but he happened not to know me I left my trunk at the hotel and went out to Washington where I found Mr Smith and learned that he was not going to start off with his drove until the next day The followig letter which was addressed to the committee to investigate the truth of my narrative will explain this part of it to the reader and corroborate my statements MAUMBE CITY April CHAS H STEWART ESQ DEAR SIR Your favor of th February addressed to me at Perrysburgh was not received until yesterday having removed to this place the letter was not forwarded as it should have been In reply to your inquiry respecting Henry Bibb I can only say that about the year I became acquainted with him at Perrysburgh employed him to do some work by the job which he performed well and from his apparent honesty and candor I became much interested in him About that time he went South for the purpose as was said of getting his wife who was there in slavery In the spring of I found him at Portsmouth on the Ohio river and after much persuasion employed him to assist my man to drive home some horses and cattle which I was about purchasing near Maysville Ky My confidence in him was such that when about half way home I separated the horses from the cattle and left him with the latter with money and instructions to hire what help he wanted to get to Perrysburgh This he accomplished to my entire satisfaction He worked for me during the summer and I was unwilling to part with him but his desire to go to school and mature plans for the liberation of his wife were so strong that he left for Detroit where he could enjoy the society of his colored brethren I have heard his story and must say that I have not the least reason to suspect it being otherwise than true and furthermore I firmly believe and have for a long time that he has the foundation to make himself useful I shall always afford him all the facilities in my power to assist him until I hear of something in relation to him to alter my mind Yours in the cause of truth J W SMITH When I arrived at Perrysburgh I went to work for Mr Smith for several months This family I found to be one of the most kind hearted and unprejudiced that I ever lived with Mr and Mrs Smith lived up to their profession I resolved to go to Detroit that winter and go to school in January But when I arrived at Detroit I soon found that I was not able to give myself a very thorough education I was among strangers who were not disposed to show me any great favors I had every thing to pay for and clothing to buy so I graduated within three weeks And this was all the schooling that I have ever had in my life W C Monroe was my teacher to him I went about two weeks only My occupation varied according to circumstances as I was not settled in mind about the condition of my bereaved family for several years and could not settle myself down at any permanent business I saw occasionally fugitives from Kentucky some of whom I knew but none of them were my relatives none could give me the information which I desired most XVII Letter from W H Gatewood My reply My efforts as a public lecturer Singular incident in Steubenville Meeting with a friend of Whitfield in Michigan Outrage on a canal packet Fruitless efforts to find my wife THE first direct information that I received concerning any of my relations after my last escape from slavery was communicated in a letter from Wm H Gatewood my former owner which I here insert word for word without any correction BEDFORD TRIMBLE COUNTY KY Mr H BIBB DEAR SIR After my respects to you and yours c I received a small book which you sent to me that I peroseed and found it was sent by H Bibb I am a stranger in Detroit and know no man there without it is Walton H Bibb if this be the man please to write to me and tell me all about that place and the people I will tell you the news here as well as I can your mother is still living here and she is well the people are generally well in this cuntry times are dull and produce low give my compliments to King Jack and all my friends in that cuntry I read that book you sent me and think it will do very well George is sold I do not know any thing about him I have nothing more at present but remain yours c W H GATEWOOD February th P S You will please to answer this letter Never was I more surprised than at the reception of this letter it came so unexpected to me There had just been a State Convention held in Detroit by the free people of color the proceedings of which were published in pamphlet form I forwarded several of them to distinguished slaveholders in Kentucky one among others was Mr Gatewood and gave him to understand who sent it After showing this letter to several of my anti slavery friends and asking their opinions about the propriety of my answering it I was advised to do it as Mr Gatewood had no claim on me as a slave for he had sold and got the money for me and my family So I wrote him an answer as near as I can recollect in the following language DEAR SIR I am happy to inform you that you are not mistaken in the man whom you sold as property and received pay for as such But I thank God that I am not property now but am regarded as a man like yourself and although I live far north I am enjoying a comfortable living by my own industry If you should ever chance to be traveling this way and will call on me I will use you better than you did me while you held me as a slave Think not that I have any malice against you for the cruel treatment which you inflicted on me while I was in your power As it was the custom of your country to treat your fellow men as you did me and my little family I can freely forgive you I wish to be remembered in love to my aged mother and friends please tell her that if we should never meet again in this life my prayer shall be to God that we may meet in Heaven where parting shall be no more You wish to be remembered to King and Jack I am pleased sir to inform you that they are both here well and doing well They are both living in Canada West They are now the owners of better farms than the men are who once owned them You may perhaps think hard of us for running away from slavery but as to myself I have but one apology to make for it which is this I have only to regret that I did not start at an earlier period I might have been free long before I was But you had it in your power to have kept me there much longer than you did I think it is very probable that I should have been a toiling slave on your plantation to day if you had treated me differently To be compelled to stand by and see you whip and slash my wife without mercy when I could afford her no protection not even by offering myself to suffer the lash in her place was more than I felt it to be the duty of a slave husband to endure while the way was open to Canada My infant child was also frequently flogged by Mrs Gatewood for crying until its skin was bruised literally purple This kind of treatment was what drove me from home and family to seek a better home for them But I am willing to forget the past I should be Pleased to hear from you again on the reception of this and should also be very happy to correspond with you often if it should be agreeable to yourself I subscribe myself a friend to the oppressed and Liberty forever HENRY BIBB WILLIAM GATEWOOD Detroit March d The first time that I ever spoke before a public audience was to give a narration of my own sufferings and adventures connected with slavery I commenced in the village of Adrian State of Michigan May From that up to the present period the principle part of my time has been faithfully devoted to the cause of freedom nerved up and encouraged by the sympathy of anti slavery friends on the one hand and prompted by a sense of duty to my enslaved countrymen on the other especially when I remembered that slavery had robbed me of my freedom deprived me of education banished me from my native State and robbed me of my family I went from Michigan to the State of Ohio where I traveled over some of the Southern counties of that State in company with Samuel Brooks and Amos Dresser lecturing upon the subject of American Slavery The prejudice of the people at that time was very strong against the abolitionists so much so that they were frequently mobbed for discussing the subject We appointed a series of meetings along on the Ohio River in sight of the State of Virginia and in several places we had Virginians over to hear us upon the subject I recollect our having appointed a meeting in the city of Steubenville which is situated on the bank of the river Ohio There was but one known abolitionist living in that city named George Ore On the day of our meeting when we arrived in this splendid city there was not a church school house nor hall that we could get for love or money to hold our meeting in Finally I believe that the whigs consented to let us have the use of their club room to hold the meeting in but before the hour had arrived for us to commence they re considered the matter and informed us that we could not have the use of their house for an abolition meeting We then got permission to hold forth in the public market house and even then so great was the hostility of the rabble that they tried to bluff us off by threats and epithets Our meeting was advertised to take place at nine o'clock A M The pro slavery parties hired a colored man to take a large auction bell and go all over the city ringing it and crying ho ye ho ye Negro auction to take place in the market house at nine o'clock by George Ore This cry was sounded all over the city which called out many who would not otherwise have been present They came to see if it was really the case The object of the rabble in having the bell rung was to prevent us from attempting to speak But at the appointed hour Bro Dresser opened the meeting with prayer and Samuel Brooks mounted the block and spoke for fifteen or twenty minutes after which Mr Dresser took the block and talked about one hour upon the wickedness of slaveholding There were not yet many persons present They were standing off I suppose to see if I was to be offered for sale Many windows were hoisted and store doors open and they were looking and listening to what was said After Mr Dresser was through I was called to take the stand Just at this moment there was no small stir in rushing forward so much indeed that I thought they were coming up to mob me I should think that in less than fifteen minutes there were about one thousand persons standing around listening I saw many of them shedding tears while I related the sad story of my wrongs At twelve o'clock we adjourned the meeting to meet again at the same place at two P M Our afternoon meeting was well attended until nearly sunset at which time we saw some signs of a mob and adjourned The mob followed us that night to the house of Mr Ore and they were yelling like tigers until late that night around the house as if they wanted to tear it down In the fall of S B Treadwell of Jackson and myself spent two or three months in lecturing through the State of Michigan upon the abolition of slavery in a section of country where abolitionists were few and far between Our meetings were generally appointed in small log cabins school houses among the farmers which were some times crowded full and where they had no horse teams it was often the case that there would be four or five ox teams come loaded down with men women and children to attend our meetings But the people were generally poor and in many places not able to give us a decent night's lodging We most generally carried with us a few pounds of candles to light up the houses wherein we held our meetings after night for in many places they had neither candles nor candlesticks After meeting was out we have frequently gone from three to eight miles to get lodging through the dark forest where there was scarcely any road for a wagon to run on I have traveled for miles over swamps where the roads were covered with logs without any dirt over them which has sometimes shook and jostled the wagon to pieces where we could find no shop or any place to mend it We would have to tie it up with bark or take the lines to tie it with and lead the horse by the bridle At other times we were in mud up to the hubs of the wheels I recollect one evening we lectured in a little village where there happened to be a Southerner present who was a personal friend of Deacon Whitfield who became much offended at what I said about his Bro Whitfield and complained about it after the meeting was out He told the people not to believe a word I said that it was all a humbug They ask him how he knew Ah said he he has slandered Bro Whitfield I am well acquainted with him we both belonged to one church and Whitfield is one of the most respectable men in all that region of country They asked if he Whitfield was a slaveholder The reply was yes but he treated his slaves well Well said one that only proves that he has told us the truth for all we wish to know is that there is such a man as Whitfield as represented by Bibb and that he is a slave holder On the d Sept I started from Toledo on board the canal packet Erie for Cincinnati Ohio But before going on board I was waited on by one of the boat's crew who gave me a card of the boat upon which was printed that no pains would be spared to render all passengers comfortable who might favor them with their patronage to Cincinnati This card I slipped into my pocket supposing it might be of some use to me There were several drunken loafers on board going through as passengers one of whom used the most vulgar language in the cabin where there were ladies and even vomited But he was called a white man and a southerner which made it all right I of course took my place in the cabin with the rest and there was nothing said against it that night When the passengers went forward to settle their fare I paid as much as any other man which entitled me to the same privileges The next morning at the ringing of the breakfast bell the proprietor of the packet line Mr Samuel Doyle being on board invited the passengers to sit up to breakfast He also invited me personally to sit up to the table But after we were all seated and some had began to eat he came and ordered me up from the table and said I must wait until the rest were done I left the table without making any reply and walked out on the deck of the boat After breakfast the passengers came up and the cabin boy was sent after me to come to breakfast but I refused Shortly after this man who had ordered me from the table came up with the ladies I stepped up and asked him if he was the captain of the boat His answer was no that he was one of the proprietors I then informed him that I was going to leave his boat at the first stopping place but before leaving I wanted to ask him a few questions Have I misbehaved to any one on board of this boat Have I disobeyed any law of this boat No said he Have I not paid you as much as any other passenger through to Cincinnati Yes said he Then I am sure that I have been insulted and imposed upon on board of this boat without any just cause whatever No one has misused you for you ought to have known better than to have come to the table where there were white people Sir did you not ask me to come to the table Yes but I did not know that you was a colored man when I asked you and then it was better to insult one man than all the passengers on board of the boat Sir I do not believe that there is a gentleman or lady on board of this boat who would have considered it an insult for me to have taken my breakfast and you have imposed upon me by taking my money and promising to use me well and then to insult me as you have I don't want any of your jaw said he Sir with all due respect to your elevated station you have imposed upon me in a way which is unbecoming a gentleman I have paid my money and behaved myself as well as any other man and I am determined that no man shall impose on me as you have by deceiving me without my letting the world know it I would rather a man should rob me of my money at midnight than to take it in that way I left this boat at the first stopping place and took the next boat to Cincinnati On the last boat I had no cause to complain of my treatment When I arrived at Cincinnati I published a statement of this affair in the Daily Herald The next day Mr Doyle called on the editor in a great passion Here said he what does this mean What sir said the editor quietly Why the stuff here read it and see Read it yourself answered the editor Well I want to know if you sympathize with this nigger here Who Mr Bibb Why yes I think he is a gentleman and should be used as such Why this is all wrong all of it Put your finger on the place and I will right it Well he says that we took his money when we paid part back And if you take his part why I'll have nothing to do with your paper So ended his wrath In the anti slavery friends of Michigan employed me to take the field as an anti slavery Lecturer in that State during the Spring Summer and Fall pledging themselves to restore to me my wife and child if they were living and could be reached by human agency which may be seen by the following circular from the Signal of Liberty TO LIBERTY FRIENDS In the Signal of the th inst is a report from the undersigned respecting Henry Bibb His narrative always excites deep sympathy for himself and favorable bias for the cause which seeks to abolish the evils he so powerfully portrays Friends and foes attest his efficiency Mr Bibb has labored much in lecturing yet has collected but a bare pittance He has received from Ohio lucrative offers but we have prevailed on him to remain in this State We think that a strong obligation rests on the friends in this State to sustain Mr Bibb and restore to him his wife and child Under the expectation that Michigan will yield to these claims will support their laborer and re unite the long severed ties of husband and wife parent and child Mr Bibb will lecture through the whole State Our object is to prepare friends for the visit of Mr Bibb and to suggest an effective mode of operations for the whole State Let friends in each vicinity appoint a collector pay to him all contributions for the freedom of Mrs Bibb and child then transmit them to us We will acknowledge them in the Signal and be responsible for them We will see that the proper measures for the freedom of Mrs Bibb and child are taken and if it be within our means we will accomplish it nay we will accomplish it if the objects be living and the friends sustain us But should we fail the contributions will be held subject to the order of the donors less however by a proportionate deduction of expenses from each The hope of this re union will nerve the heart and body of Mr Bibb to re doubled effort in a cause otherwise dear to him And as he will devote his whole time systematically to the anti slavery cause he must also depend on friends for the means of livelihood We bespeak for him your hospitality and such pecuniary contributions as you can afford trusting that the latter may be sufficient to enable him to keep the field A L PORTER C H STEWART SILAS M HOLMES DETROIT APRIL I have every reason to believe that they acted faithfully in the matter but without success They wrote letters in every quarter where they would be likely to gain any information respecting her There were also two men sent from Michigan in the summer of down South to find her if possible and report and whether they found out her condition and refused to report I am not able to say but suffice it to say that they never have reported They were respectable men and true friends of the cause one of whom was a Methodist minister and the other a cabinet maker and both white men The small spark of hope which had still lingered about my heart had almost become extinct XVIII My last effort to recover my family Sad tidings of my wife Her degradation I am compelled to regard our relation as dissolved forever In view of the failure to hear any thing of my wife many of my best friends advised me to get married again if I could find a suitable person They regarded my former wife as dead to me and all had been done that could be But I was not yet satisfied myself to give up I wanted to know certainly what had become of her So in the winter of I resolved to go back to Kentucky my native State to see if I could hear anything from my family And against the advice of all my friends I went back to Cincinnati where I took passage on board of a Southern steamboat to Madison in the State of Indiana which was only ten miles from where Wm Gatewood lived who was my former owner No sooner had I landed in Madison than I learned on inquiry and from good authority that my wife was living in a state of adultery with her master and had been for the last three years This message she sent back to Kentucky to her mother and friends She also spoke of the time and manner of our separation by Deacon Whitfield my being taken off by the Southern blacklegs to where she knew not and that she had finally given me up The child she said was still with her Whitfield had sold her to this man for the above purposes at a high price and she was better used than ordinary slaves This was a death blow to all my hopes and pleasant plans While I was in Madison I hired a white man to go over to Bedford in Kentucky where my mother was then living and bring her over into a free State to see me I hailed her approach with unspeakable joy She informed me too on inquiring whether my family had ever been heard from that the report which I had just heard in relation to Malinda was substantially true for it was the same message that she had sent to her mother and friends And my mother thought it was no use for me to run any more risks or to grieve myself any more about her From that time I gave her into the hands of an all wise Providence As she was then living with another man I could no longer regard her as my wife After all the sacrifices sufferings and risks which I had run striving to rescue her from the grasp of slavery every prospect and hope was cut off She has ever since been regarded as theoretically and practically dead to me as a wife for she was living in a state of adultery according to the law of God and man Poor unfortunate woman I bring no charge of it against her for I know not all the circumstances connected with the case It is consistent with slavery however to suppose that she became reconciled to it from the fact of her sending word back to her friends and relatives that she was much better treated than she had ever been before and that she had also given me up It is also reasonable to suppose that there might have been some kind of attachment formed by living together in this way for years and it is quite probable that they have other children according to the law of nature which would have a tendency to unite them stronger together In view of all the facts and circumstances connected with this matter I deem further comments and explanations unnecessary on my part Finding myself thus isolated in this peculiarly unnatural state I resolved in to spend my days in traveling to advance the anti slavery cause I spent the summer in Michigan but in the subsequent fall I took a trip to New England where I spent the winter And there I found a kind reception where ever I traveled among the friends of freedom While traveling about in this way among strangers I was sometimes sick with no permanent home or bosom friend to sympathise or take that care of me which an affectionate wife would So I conceived the idea that it would be better for me to change my position provided I should find a suitable person In the month of May I attended the anti slavery anniversary in the city of New York where I had the good fortune to be introduced to the favor of a Miss Mary E Miles of Boston a lady whom I had frequently heard very highly spoken of for her activity and devotion to the anti slavery cause as well as her talents and learning and benevolence in the cause of reforms generally I was very much impressed with the personal appearance of Miss Miles and was deeply interested in our first interview because I found that her principles and my own were nearly one and the same I soon found by a few visits as well as by letters that she possessed moral principle and frankness of disposition which is often sought for but seldom found These in connection with other amiable qualities soon won my entire confidence and affection But this secret I kept to myself until I was fully satisfied that this feeling was reciprocal that there was indeed a congeniality of principles and feeling which time nor eternity could never change When I offered myself for matrimony we mutually engaged ourselves to each other to marry in one year with this condition viz that if either party should see any reason to change their mind within that time the contract should not be considered binding We kept up a regular correspondence during the time and in June we had the happiness to be joined in holy wedlock Not in slave holding style which is a mere farce without the sanction of law or gospel but in accordance with the laws of God and our country My beloved wife is a bosom friend a help meet a loving companion in all the social moral and religious relations of life She is to me what a poor slave's wife can never be to her husband while in the condition of a slave for she can not be true to her husband contrary to the will of her master She can neither be pure nor virtuous contrary to the will of her master She dare not refuse to be reduced to a state of adultery at the will of her master from the fact that the slaveholding law customs and teachings are all against the poor slaves I presume there are no class of people in the United States who so highly appreciate the legality of marriage as those persons who have been held and treated as property Yes it is that fugitive who knows from sad experience what it is to have his wife tyrannically snatched from his bosom by a slaveholding professor of religion and finally reduced to a state of adultery that knows how to appreciate the law that repels such high handed villany Such as that to which the writer has been exposed But thanks be to God I am now free from the hand of the cruel oppressor no more to be plundered of my dearest rights the wife of my bosom and my poor unoffending offspring Of Malinda I will only add a word in conclusion The relation once subsisting between us to which I clung hoping against hope for years after we were torn assunder not having been sanctioned by any loyal power cannot be cancelled by a legal process Voluntarily assumed without law mutually it was by her relinquished years ago without my knowledge as before named during which time I was making every effort to secure her restoration And it was not until after living alone in the world for more than eight years without a companion known in law or morals that I changed my condition XIX Comments on S Gatewood's letter about slaves stealing Their conduct vindicated Comments on W Gatewood's letter BUT it seems that I am not now beyond the reach of the foul slander of slaveholders They are not satisfied with selling and banishing me from my native State As soon as they got news of my being in the free North exposing their peculiar Institution a libelous letter was written by Silas Gatewood of Kentucky a son of one of my former owners to a Northern Committee for publication which he thought would destroy my influence and character This letter will be found in the introduction He has charged me with the awful crime of taking from my keeper and oppressor some of the fruits of my own labor for the benefit of myself and family But while writing this letter he seems to have overlooked the disgraceful fact that he was guilty himself of what would here be regarded highway robbery in his conduct to me as narrated on of this narrative A word in reply to Silas Gatewood's letter I am willing to admit all that is true but shall deny that which is so basely false In the first place he puts words in my mouth that I never used He says that I represented that my mother belonged to James Bibb I deny ever having said so in private or public He says that I stated that Bibb's daughter married a Sibley I deny it He also says that the first time that I left Kentucky for my liberty I was gone about two years before I went back to rescue my family I deny it I was gone from Dec th to May or June He says that I went back the second time for the purpose of taking off my family and eight or ten more slaves to Canada This I will not pretend to deny He says I was guilty of disposing of articles from the farm for my own use and pocketing the money and that his father caught me stealing a sack full of wheat I admit the fact I acknowledge the wheat And who had a better right to eat of the fruits of my own hard earnings than myself Many a long summer's day have I toiled with my wife and other slaves cultivating his father's fields and gathering in his harvest under the scorching rays of the sun without half enough to eat or clothes to wear and at the same time his meat house was filled with bacon and bread stuff his dairy with butter and cheese his barn with grain husbanded by the unrequited toil of the slaves And yet if a slave presumed to take a little from the abundance which he had made by his own sweat and toil to supply the demands of nature to quiet the craving appetite which is sometimes almost irresistible it is called stealing by slaveholders But I did not regard it as stealing then I do not regard it as such now I hold that a slave has a moral right to eat drink and wear all that he needs and that it would be a sin on his part to suffer and starve in a country where there is a plenty to eat and wear within his reach I consider that I had a just right to what I took because it was the labor of my own hands Should I take from a neighbor as a freeman in a free country I should consider myself guilty of doing wrong before God and man But was I the slave of Wm Gatewood to day or any other slaveholder working without wages and suffering with hunger or for clothing I should not stop to inquire whether my master would approve of my helping myself to what I needed to eat or wear For while the slave is regarded as property how can he steal from his master It is contrary to the very nature of the relation existing between master and slave from the fact that there is no law to punish a slave for theft but lynch law and the way they avoid that is to hide well For illustration a slave from the State of Virginia for cruel treatment left the State between daylight and dark being borne off by one of his master's finest horses and finally landed in Canada where the British laws recognise no such thing as property in a human being He was pursued by his owners who expected to take advantage of the British law by claiming him as a fugitive from justice and as such he was arrested and brought before the court of Queen's Bench They swore that he was at a certain time the slave of Mr A and that he ran away at such a time and stole and brought off a horse They enquired who the horse belonged to and it was ascertained that the slave and horse both belonged to the same person The court therefore decided that the horse and the man were both recognised in the State of Virginia alike as articles of property belonging to the same person therefore if there was theft committed on either side the former must have stolen off the latter the horse brought away the man and not the man the horse So the man was discharged and pronounced free according to the laws of Canada There are several other letters published in this work upon the same subject from slaveholders which it is hardly necessary for me to notice However I feel thankful to the writers for the endorsement and confirmation which they have given to my story No matter what their motives were they have done me and the anti slavery cause good service in writing those letters but more especially the Gatewood's Silas Gatewood has done more for me than all the rest He has labored so hard in his long communication in trying to expose me that he has proved every thing that I could have asked of him and for which I intend to reward him by forwarding him one of my books hoping that it may be the means of converting him from a slaveholder to an honest man and an advocate of liberty for all mankind The reader will see in the introduction that Wm Gatewood writes a more cautious letter upon the subject than his son Silas It is not a very easy matter to catch old birds with chaff and I presume if Silas had the writing of his letter over again he would not be so free in telling all he knew and even more for the sake of making out a strong case The object of his writing such a letter will doubtless be understood by the reader It was to destroy public confidence in the victims of slavery that the system might not be exposed it was to gag a poor fugitive who had undertaken to plead his own cause and that of his enslaved brethren It was a feeble attempt to suppress the voice of universal freedom which is now thundering on every gale But thank God it is too late in the day Go stop the mighty thunder's roar Go hush the ocean's sound Or upward like the eagle soar To skies' remotest bound And when thou hast the thunder stopped And hushed the ocean's waves Then freedom's spirit bind in chains And ever hold us slaves And when the eagle's boldest feat Thou canst perform with skill Then think to stop proud freedom's march And hold the bondman still XX Review of my narrative Licentiousness a prop of slavery A case of mild slavery given Its revolting features Times of my purchase and sale by professed Christians Concluding remarks I now conclude my narrative by reviewing briefly what I have written This little work has been written without any personal aid or a knowledge of the English grammer which must in part be my apology for many of its imperfections I find in several places where I have spoken out the deep feelings of my soul in trying to describe the horrid treatment which I have so often received at the hands of slaveholding professors of religion that I might possibly make a wrong impression on the minds of some northern freemen who are unacquainted theoretically or practically with the customs and treatment of American slaveholders to their slaves I hope that it may not be supposed by any that I have exaggerated in the least for the purpose of making out the system of slavery worse than it really is for to exaggerate upon the cruelties of this system would be almost impossible and to write herein the most horrid features of it would not be in good taste for my book I have long thought from what has fallen under my own observation while a slave that the strongest reason why southerners stick with such tenacity to their peculiar instiution is because licentious white men could not carry out their wicked purposes among the defenceless colored population as they now do without being exposed and punished by law if slavery was abolished Female virtue could not be trampled under foot with impunity and marriage among the people of color kept in utter obscurity On the other hand lest it should be said by slaveholders and their apologists that I have not done them the justice to give a sketch of the best side of slavery if there can be any best side to it therefore in conclusion they may have the benefit of the following case that fell under the observation of the writer And I challenge America to show a milder state of slavery than this I once knew a Methodist in the state of Ky by the name of Young who was the owner of a large number of slaves many of whom belonged to the same church with their master They worshipped together in the same church Mr Young never was known to flog one of his slaves or sell one He fed and clothed them well and never over worked them He allowed each family a small house to themselves with a little garden spot whereon to raise their own vegetables and a part of the day on Saturdays was allowed them to cultivate it In process of time he became deeply involved in debt by endorsing notes and his property was all advertised to be sold by the sheriff at public auction It consisted in slaves many of whom were his brothers and sisters in the church On the day of sale there were slave traders and speculators on the ground to buy The slaves were offered on the auction block one after another until they were all sold before their old master's face The first man offered on the block was an old gray headed slave by the name of Richard His wife followed him up to the block and when they had bid him up to seventy or eighty dollars one of the bidders asked Mr Young what he could do as he looked very old and infirm Mr Young replied by saying he is not able to accomplish much manual labor from his extreme age and hard labor in early life Yet I would rather have him than many of those who are young and vigorous who are able to perform twice as much labor because I know him to be faithful and trustworthy a Christian in good standing in my church I can trust him anywhere with confidence He has toiled many long years on my plantation and I have always found him faithful This giving him a good Christian character caused them to run him up to near two hundred dollars His poor old companion stood by weeping and pleading that they might not be separated But the marriage relation was soon dissolved by the sale and they were separated never to meet again Another man was called up whose wife followed him with her infant in her arms beseeching to be sold with her husband which proved to be all in Illustration Illustration vain After the men were all sold they then sold the women and children They ordered the first woman to lay down her child and mount the auction block she refused to give up her little one and clung to it as long as she could while the cruel lash was applied to her back for disobedience She pleaded for mercy in the name of God But the child was torn from the arms of its mother amid the most heart rending shrieks from the mother and child on the one hand and bitter oaths and cruel lashes from the tyrants on the other Finally the poor little child was torn from the mother while she was sacrificed to the highest bidder In this way the sale was carried on from begining to end There was each speculator with his hand cuffs to bind his victims after the sale and while they were doing their writings the Christian portion of the slaves asked permission to kneel in prayer on the ground before they separated which was granted And while bathing each other with tears of sorrow on the verge of their final separation their eloquent appeals in prayer to the Most High seemed to cause an unpleasant sensation upon the ears of their tyrants who ordered them to rise and make ready their limbs for the caffles And as they happened not to bound at the first sound they were soon raised from their knees by the sound of the lash and the rattle of the chains in which they were soon taken off by their respective masters husbands from wives and children from parents never expecting to meet until the judgment of the great day Then Christ shall say to the slaveholding professors of religion Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these little ones my brethren ye did it unto me Having thus tried to show the best side of slavery that I can conceive of the reader can exercise his own judgment in deciding whether a man can be a Bible Christian and yet hold his Christian brethren as property so that they may be sold at any time in market as sheep or oxen to pay his debts During my life in slavery I have been sold by professors of religion several times In Bro Albert G Sibley of Bedford Kentucky sold me for to Bro John Sibley and in the same year he sold me to Bro Wm Gatewood of Bedford for In Bro Gatewood sold me to Madison Garrison a slave trader of Louisville Kentucky with my wife and child at a depreciated price because I was a runaway In the same year he sold me with my family to Bro Whitfield in the city of New Orleans for in Bro Whitfield sold me from my family to Thomas Wilson and Co blacklegs In the same Tear they sold me to a Bro in the Indian Territory I think he was a member of the Presbyterian Church F E Whitfield was a deacon in regular standing in the Baptist Church A Sibley was a Methodist exhorter of the M E Church in good standing J Sibley was a class leader in the same church and Wm Gatewood was also an acceptable member of the same church Is this Christianity Is it honest or right Is it doing as we would be done by Is it in accordance with the principles of humanity or justice I believe slaveholding to be a sin against God and man under all circumstances I have no sympathy with the person or persons who tolerate and support the system willingly and knowingly morally religiously or politically Prayerfully and earnestly relying on the power of truth and the aid of the divine providence I trust that this little volume will bear some humble part in lighting up the path of freedom and revolutionizing public opinion upon this great subject And I here pledge myself God being my helper ever to contend for the natural equality of the human family without regard to color which is but fading matter while mind makes the man NEW YORK CITY May HENRY BIBB OPINIONS OF THE PRESS From the many favorable notices of the Press which this volume has received the following have been selected From the New York Evangelist It will be difficult for any reader however suspicious of narratives of this kind to resist the conviction which the simplicity candor and good feeling of this work produces of its entire truthfulness And if true what a history it depicts Such oppression fear and suffering such courage and energy such meek endurance and perseverance could only be exemplified by one whose nature was taxed to the uttermost The hardest task the reader will find is to suppress his indignation and to keep the balance of his judgment in reference to a system which can possibly lead to such monstrous results We wish the book might obtain a universal perusal It is adapted to produce the right kind of feeling a feeling of deep and abiding sympathy for the oppressed We are all too indifferent to the wrongs of the slave We do not make his case our own We do not feel for those in bonds as bound with them There is a lamentable lack of proper Christian sympathy and it is one of the best results of a book like this that it quickens the flow of feeling and touches the heart Mr Bibb has manifested by a blameless life and by extraordinary talents a character which not only corroborates the truth of his history but powerfully illustrates the terrible nature of the system whose oppressions he here records For his sake as well as for the sake of humanity and freedom we hope an extensive sale awaits the little volume It is small neatly printed and sold at a low price from fifty cents to seventy five cents per copy Let there be a little Christian generosity exhibited in the sale of the work From the Liberator Henry Bibb the well known fugitive slave has just published in elegant style and with sundry pictorial illustrations a Narrative of his Life and Adventures written by himself and remarkably well written too with an Introduction by Lucius C Matlac Of all the narratives that have been published no one exceeds this in thrilling interest and of all the subjects of them no one appears to have seen and suffered so much as Mr Bibb It is a book for the rising generation in particular and we could wish that as many copies of it might be sold during the present year as there are slaves in the United States From the True Wesleyan This is a volume of s handsomely printed on good paper and well bound But it is not in the execution that the interest lies it is in the thrilling incidents so well told We have never been a great reader of novels as all must know by our style of writing yet we have read enough to know the almost resistless power which a well executed tale when once we commence reading exerts over the mind until we reach the end and did we not know the author and know from the best of proof that the book is a true narrative on reading it we should pronounce it a novel The reader may rely upon its truth and yet he will find it so full of touching incidents daring adventures and hair breadth escapes that he will find his attention held spell bound from the time he begins until he has finished the little volume We think the work cannot fail to meet with an extensive sale From the New York Tribune This is a Narrative of intense interest The author is well known as a powerful speaker keen in debate shrewd in argument and dangerous in retort He here shows an equally ready command of the pen and has produced a book which would do credit to a practiced writer No stronger proof of the absurdity of slavery can be demanded than this little history By appealing to the sense of justice and the feeling of sympathy in this artless record of a noble struggle with oppression and outrage Mr Bibb will make an impression on many readers who would not be reached by more elaborate statements His book has the attraction of a romance though there was no romance in his sufferings They were matter of fact realities of the sternest kind From the North Star After waiting several weeks we have received a copy of this little work It is certainly one of the most interesting and thrilling narratives of slavery ever laid before the American people The exposure which the author makes of the horrors of slavery the separations the whippings and the accumulated outrages inflicted on the slave must stir the blood of every reader who has the pulsations of a man The description of the slave's longing for freedom of his deception tricks and stratagems to escape his condition is just though humiliating His narrations of the cruelty of individual slaveholders is natural and we doubt not in every essential particular is true We deem the work a most valuable acquisition to the anti slavery cause and we hope that it may be widely circulated through out the country From the Chronotype This fugitive slave literature is destined to be a powerful lever We have the most profound conviction of its potency We see in it the easy and infallible means of abolitionizing the free states Argument provokes argument reason is met by sophistry But narratives of slaves go right to the hearts of men We defy any man to think with any patience or tolerance of slavery after reading Bibb's narrative unless he is one of those infidels to nature who float on the race as monsters from it but not of it Put a dozen copies of this book into every school district or neighborhood in the Free States and we have known candidates of the Free Soil party whose wealth would not miss the requisite to do it and you might sweep the whole north on a thorough going Liberty Platform for abolishing slavery everywhere and every how Stir up honest men's souls with such a book and they won't set much by disclaimers they won't be squeamish how radically they vote against a system which surpasses any hell which theology has ever been able to conjure up We believe this to be an unvarnished tale giving a true picture of slavery in all its features good bad and indifferent if it has so many The book is written with perfect artlessness and the man who can read it unmoved must be fit for treasons stratagems and spoils One conclusion forced upon the philosophical reader of such narratives of runaway slaves is this that however tolerable chattel slavery may be as an institution for savage and barbarous life when you bring it into the purlieus of civilization and Christianity it becomes unspeakably iniquitous and intolerable If Mr Calhoun really means to upheld slavery he must there is no help for it abolish Christianity printing art science and take his patriarchs back to the standard of Central Africa or the days of Shem Ham and Japhet

gains his fortune from the blood of souls Cowper ELEVENTH THOUSAND LONDON CHARLES GILPIN BISHOPGATE ST WITHOUT Printed chiefly from the American Stereotype Plates by Webb and Chapman Great Brunswick street Dublin i TO WELLS BROWN OF OHIO THIRTEEN years ago I came to your door a weary fugitive from chains and stripes I was a stranger and you took me in I was hungry and you fed me Naked was I and you clothed me Even a name by which to be known among men slavery had denied me You bestowed upon me your own Base indeed should I be if I ever forget what I owe to you or do anything to disgrace that honored name As a slight testimony of my gratitude to my earliest benefactor I take the liberty to inscribe to you this little narrative of the sufferings from which I was fleeing when you had compassion upon me In the multitude that you have succored it is very possible that you may not remember me but until I forget God and myself I can never forget you Your grateful friend WILLIAM WELLS BROWN ii FLING OUT THE ANTI SLAVERY FLAG BY W W BROWN FLING out the Anti Slavery flag On every swelling breeze And let its folds wave o'er the land And o'er the raging seas Till all beneath the standard sheet With new allegiance bow And pledge themselves to onward bear The emblem of their vow Fling out the Anti Slavery flag And let it onward wave Till it shall float o'er every clime And liberate the slave Till like a meteor flashing far It bursts with glorious light And with its heaven born rays dispels The gloom of sorrow's night Fling out the Anti Slavery flag And let it not be furled Till like a planet of the skies It sweeps around the world And when each poor degraded slave Is gathered near and far O fix it on the azure arch As hope's eternal star Fling out the Anti Slavery flag Forever let it be The emblem to a holy cause The banner of the free And never from its guardian height Let it by man be driven But let it float forever there Beneath the smiles of heaven iii NOTE TO THE FOURTH AMERICAN EDITION Three editions of this work consisting in all of eight thousand copies were sold in less than eighteen months from the time the first edition was published No antislavery work has met with a more rapid sale in the United States than this narrative The present edition is published to meet the demand now existing for the work THE PUBLISHER NOTE TO THE PRESENT EDITION THE present Narrative was first published in Boston U S in July and eight thousand copies were sold in less than eighteen months from the time of its publication This rapid sale may be attributed to the circumstance that for three years preceding its publication I had been employed as a lecturing agent by the American Anti slavery Society and I was thus very generally known throughout the Free States of the Great Republic as one who had spent the first twenty years of his life as a slave in her southern house of bondage In visiting Great Britain I had two objects in view Firstly I have been chosen as a delegate by the American Peace Committee for a Congress of Nations to attend the Peace Convention to be held in Paris during the last week of the present month August Many of the most distinguished American Abolitionists considered it a triumphant evidence of the progress of their principles that one of the oppressed coloured race one who is even now by the constitution of the United States a slave should have been selected for this honourable office and were therefore very desirous that I should attend Secondly I wished to follow up the work of my friends and fellow labourers Charles Lenox Remond and Frederick Douglas and to lay before the people of Great Britain and Ireland the wrongs that are still committed iv upon the slaves and the free coloured people of America The rapid increase of communication between the two sides of the Atlantic has brought them so close together that the personal intercourse between the British people and American slaveowners is now very great and the slaveholder crafty and politic as deliberate tyrants generally are rarely leaves the shores of Europe without attempting at least to assuage the prevalent hostility against his beloved peculiar institution The influence of the Southern States of America is mainly directed to the maintenance and propagation of the system of slavery in their own and in other countries In the pursuit of this object every consideration of religion liberty national strength and social order is made to give way and hitherto they have been very successful The actual number of the slaveholders is small but their union is complete so that they form a dominant oligarchy in the United States It is my desire in common with every abolitionist to diminish their influence and this can only be effected by the promulgation of truth and the cultivation of a correct public sentiment at home and abroad Slavery cannot be let alone It is aggressive and must either be succumbed to or put down It has been suggested that my narrative is somewhat deficient in dates From my total want of education previous to my escape from slavery I am unable to give them with much accuracy The ignorance of the American slaves is with rare exceptions intense and the slaveholders generally do their utmost to perpetuate this mental darkness The perpetuation of slavery depends upon it Whatever may be said of the physical condition of the slaves it is undeniable that if they were not kept in a state of intellectual religious and moral degradation they could be retained as slaves no longer In conclusion I ask the attention of the reader to the Resolutions of the coloured citizens of Boston and to the other documents in reference to myself which will be found at the end of the book Of the latter two are from the pen of WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON that faithful and indefatigable friend of the oppressed whose position as the Pioneer of the anti slavery movement has secured to him more than to any other American abolitionist the gratitude of the coloured race and a world wide reputation WILLIAM WELLS BROWN Great Brunswick street Dublin August th v LETTER from EDMUND QUINCY ESQ DEDHAM JULY To WILLIAM W BROWN MY DEAR FRIEND I heartily thank you for the privilege of reading the manuscript of your Narrative I have read it with deep interest and strong emotion I am much mistaken if it be not greatly successful and eminently useful It presents a different phase of the infernal slave system from that portrayed in the admirable story of Mr Douglass and gives us a glimpse of its hideous cruelties in other portions of its domain Your opportunities of observing the workings of this accursed system have been singularly great Your experiences in the Field in the House and especially on the River in the service of the slave trader Walker have been such as few individuals have had no one certainly who has been competent to describe them What I have admired and marvelled at in your Narrative is the simplicity and calmness with which you describe scenes and actions which might well move the very vi stones to rise and mutiny against the National Institution which makes them possible You will perceive that I have made very sparing use of your flattering permission to alter what you had written To correct a few errors which appeared to be merely clerical ones committed in the hurry of composition under unfavorable circumstances and to suggest a few curtailments is all that I have ventured to do I should be a bold man as well as a vain one if I should attempt to improve your descriptions of what you have seen and suffered Some of the scenes are not unworthy of De Foe himself I trust and believe that your Narrative will have a wide circulation I am sure it deserves it At least a man must be differently constituted from me who can rise from the perusal of your Narrative without feeling that he understands slavery better and hates it worse than he ever did before I am very faithfully and respectfully Your friend EDMUND QUINCY vii PREFACE WHEN I first published this Narrative the public had no evidence whatever that I had been a slave except my own story As soon as the work came from the press I sent several copies to slaveholders residing at the South with whom I was acquainted and among others one to Mr Enoch Price the man who claims my body and soul as his property and from whom I had run away A few weeks after the Narrative was sent Edmund Quincy Esq received the following letter from Mr Price It tells its own story and forever settles the question of my having been a slave Here is the letter ST LOUIS Jan th SIR I received a pamphlet or a Narrative so called on the title of the Life of William W Brown a fugitive slave purporting to have been written by himself and in his book I see a letter from you to said William W Brown This said Brown is named Sanford he is a slave belonging to me and ran away from me the first day of January Now I see many things in his book that are not true and a part of viii it as near true as a man could recollect after so long a time I purchased him of Mr S Willi the last of September I paid six hundred and fifty dollars for him If I had wanted to speculate on him I could have sold him for three times as much as I paid for him I was offered two thousand dollars for him in New Orleans at one time and fifteen hundred dollars for him at another time in Louisville Kentucky But I would not sell him I was told that he was going to run away the day before he ran away but I did not believe the man for I had so much confidence in Sanford I want you to see him and see if what I say is not the truth I do not want him as a slave but I think that his friends who sustain him and give him the right hand of fellowship or he himself could afford to pay my agent in Boston three hundred and twenty five dollars and I will give him free papers so that he may go wherever he wishes to Then he can visit St Louis or any other place he may wish This amount is just half that I paid for him Now if this offer suits Mr Brown and the Anti Slavery Society of Boston or Massachusetts let me know and I will give you the name of my agent in Boston and forward the papers to be given to William W Brown as soon as the money is paid Yours respectfully E PRICE TO EDMUND QUINCY Esq Mr Price says that he sees many things in my book which are not true and a part of it as near true as a man could recollect after so long a time As I was with Mr Price only three months and have devoted only six s to him and his family he can know but little about my narrative except that ix part which speaks of him But I am willing to avail myself of his testimony for he says that a part of it is true But I cannot accept of Mr Price's offer to become a purchaser of my body and soul God made me as free as he did Enoch Price and Mr Price shall never receive a dollar from me or my friends with my consent Boston October W W BROWN The author caught by the bloodhounds See p NARRATIVE I I was born in Lexington Ky The man who stole me as soon as I was born recorded the births of all the infants which he claimed to be born his property in a book which he kept for that purpose My mother's name was Elizabeth She had seven children viz Solomon Leander Benjamin Joseph Millford Elizabeth and myself No two of us were children of the same father My father's name as I learned from my mother was George Higgins He was a white man a relative of my master and connected with some of the first families in Kentucky My master owned about forty slaves twenty five of whom were field hands He removed from Kentucky to Missouri when I was quite young and settled thirty or forty miles above St Charles on the Missouri where in addition to his practice as a physician he carried on milling merchandizing and farming He had a large farm the principal productions of which were tobacco and hemp The slave cabins were situated on the back part of the farm with the house of the overseer whose name was Grove Cook in their midst He had the entire charge of the farm and having no family was allowed a woman to keep house for him whose business it was to deal out the provisions for the hands A woman was also kept at the quarters to do the cooking for the field hands who were summoned to their unrequited toil every morning at four o'clock by the ringing of a bell hung on a post near the house of the overseer They were allowed half an hour to eat their breakfast and get to the field At half past four a horn was blown by the overseer which was the signal to commence work and every one that was not on the spot at the time had to receive ten lashes from the negro whip with which the overseer always went armed The handle was about three feet long with the butt end filled with lead and the lash six or seven feet in length made of cow hide with platted wire on the end of it This whip was put in requisition very frequently and freely and a small offence on the part of a slave furnished an occasion for its use During the time that Mr Cook was overseer I was a house servant a situation preferable to that of a field hand as I was better fed better clothed and not obliged to rise at the ringing of the bell but about half an hour after I have often laid and heard the crack of the whip and the screams of the slave My mother was a field hand and one morning was ten or fifteen minutes behind the others in getting into the field As soon as she reached the spot where they were at work the overseer commenced whipping her She cried Oh pray Oh pray Oh pray these are generally the words of slaves when imploring mercy at the hands of their oppressors I heard her voice and knew it and jumped out of my bunk and went to the door Though the field was some distance from the house I could hear every crack of the whip and every groan and cry of my poor mother I remained at the door not daring to venture any further The cold chills ran over me and I wept aloud After giving her ten lashes the sound of the whip ceased and I returned to my bed and found no consolation but in my tears Experience has taught me that nothing can be more heart rending than for one to see a dear and beloved mother or sister tortured and to hear their cries and not be able to render them assistance But such is the position which an American slave occupies My master being a politician soon found those who were ready to put him into office for the favors he could render them and a few years after his arrival in Missouri he was elected to a seat in the legislature In his absence from home everything was left in charge of Mr Cook the overseer and he soon became more tyrannical and cruel Among the slaves on the plantation was one by the name of Randall He was a man about six feet high and well proportioned and known as a man of great strength and power He was considered the most valuable and able bodied slave on the plantation but no matter how good or useful a slave may be he seldom escapes the lash But it was not so with Randall He had been on the plantation since my earliest recollection and I had never known of his being flogged No thanks were due to the master or overseer for this I have often heard him declare that no white man should ever whip him that he would die first Cook from the time that he came upon the plantation had frequently declared that he could and would flog any nigger that was put into the field to work under him My master had repeatedly told him not to attempt to whip Randall but he was determined to try it As soon as he was left sole dictator he thought the time had come to put his threats into execution He soon began to find fault with Randall and threatened to whip him if he did not do better One day he gave him a very hard task more than he could possibly do and at night the task not being performed he told Randall that he should remember him the next morning On the following morning after the hands had taken breakfast Cook called out to Randall and told him that he intended to whip him and ordered him to cross his hands and be tied Randall asked why he wished to whip him He answered because he had not finished his task the day before Randall said that the task was too great or he should have done it Cook said it made no difference he should whip him Randall stood silent for a moment and then said Mr Cook I have always tried to please you since you have been on the plantation and I find you are determined not to be satisfied with my work let me do as well as I may No man has laid hands on me to whip me for the last ten years and I have long since come to the conclusion not to be whipped by any man living Cook finding by Randall's determined look and gestures that he would resist called three of the hands from their work and commanded them to seize Randall and tie him The hands stood still they knew Randall and they also knew him to be a powerful man and were afraid to grapple with him As soon as Cook had ordered the men to seize him Randall turned to them and said Boys you all know me you know that I can handle any three of you and the man that lays hands on me shall die This white man can't whip me himself and therefore he has called you to help him The overseer was unable to prevail upon them to seize and secure Randall and finally ordered them all to go to their work together Nothing was said to Randall by the overseer for more than a week One morning however while the hands were at work in the field he came into it accompanied by three friends of his Thompson Woodbridge and Jones They came up to where Randall was at work and Cook ordered him to leave his work and go with them to the barn He refused to go whereupon he was attacked by the overseer and his companions when he turned upon them and laid them one after another prostrate on the ground Woodbridge drew out his pistol and fired at him and brought him to the ground by a pistol ball The others rushed upon him with their clubs and beat him over the head and face until they succeeded in tying him He was then taken to the barn and tied to a beam Cook gave him over one hundred lashes with a heavy cow hide had him washed with salt and water and left him tied during the day The next day he was untied and taken to a blacksmith's shop and had a ball and chain attached to his leg He was compelled to labor in the field and perform the same amount of work that the other hands did When his master returned home he was much pleased to find that Randall had been subdued in his absence II Soon afterwards my master removed to the city of St Louis and purchased a farm four miles from there which he placed under the charge of an overseer by the name of Friend Haskell He was a regular Yankee from New England The Yankees are noted for making the most cruel overseers My mother was hired out in the city and I was also hired out there to Major Freeland who kept a public house He was formerly from Virginia and was a horse racer cock fighter gambler and withal an inveterate drunkard There were ten or twelve servants in the house and when he was present it was cut and slash knock down and drag out In his fits of anger he would take up a chair and throw it at a servant and in his more rational moments when he wished to chastise one he would tie them up in the smoke house and whip them after which he would cause a fire to be made of tobacco stems and smoke them This he called Virginia play I complained to my master of the treatment which I received from Major Freeland but it made no difference He cared nothing about it so long as he received the money for my labor After living with Major Freeland five or six months I ran away and went into the woods back of the city and when night came on I made my way to my master's farm but was afraid to be seen knowing that if Mr Haskell the overseer should discover me I should be again carried back to Major Freeland so I kept in the woods One day while in the woods I heard the barking and howling of dogs and in a short time they came so near that I knew them to be the bloodhounds of Major Benjamin O'Fallon He kept five or six to hunt runaway slaves with As soon as I was convinced that it was them I knew there was no chance of escape I took refuge in the top of a tree and the hounds were soon at its base and there remained until the hunters came up in a half or three quarters of an hour afterwards There were two men with the dogs who as soon as they came up ordered me to descend I came down was tied and taken to St Louis jail Major Freeland soon made his appearance and took me out and ordered me to follow him which I did After we returned home I was tied up in the smoke house and was very severely whipped After the major had flogged me to his satisfaction he sent out his son Robert a young man eighteen or twenty years of age to see that I was well smoked He made a fire of tobacco stems which soon set me to coughing and sneezing This Robert told me was the way his father used to do to his slaves in Virginia After giving me what they conceived to be a decent smoking I was untied and again set to work Robert Freeland was a chip of the old block Though quite young it was not unfrequently that he came home in a state of intoxication He is now I believe a popular commander of a steam boat on the Mississippi river Major Freeland soon after failed in business and I was put on board the steamboat Missouri which plied between St Louis and Galena The commander of the boat was William B Culver I remained on her during the sailing season which was the most pleasant time for me that I had ever experienced At the close of navigation I was hired to Mr John Colburn keeper of the Missouri Hotel He was from one of the free states but a more inveterate hater of the negro I do not believe ever walked God's green earth This hotel was at that time one of the largest in the city and there were employed in it twenty or thirty servants mostly slaves Mr Colburn was very abusive not only to the servants but to his wife also who was an excellent woman and one from whom I never knew a servant to receive a harsh word but never did I know a kind one to a servant from her husband Among the slaves employed in the hotel was one by the name of Aaron who belonged to Mr John F Darby a lawyer Aaron was the knife cleaner One day one of the knives was put on the table not as clean as it might have been Mr Colburn for this offence tied Aaron up in the wood house and gave him over fifty lashes on the bare back with a cow hide after which he made me wash him down with rum This seemed to put him into more agony than the whipping After being untied he went home to his master and complained of the treatment which he had received Mr Darby would give no heed to anything he had to say but sent him directly back Colburn learning that he had been to his master with complaints tied him up again and gave him a more severe whipping than before The poor fellow's back was literally cut to pieces so much so that he was not able to work for ten or twelve days There was also among the servants a girl whose master resided in the country Her name was Patsey Mr Colburn tied her up one evening and whipped her until several of the boarders came out and begged him to desist The reason for whipping her was this She was engaged to be married to a man belonging to Major William Christy who resided four or five miles north of the city Mr Colburn had forbid her to see John Christy The reason of this was said to be the regard which he himself had for Patsey She went to meeting that evening and John returned home with her Mr Colburn had intended to flog John if he came within the inclosure but John knew too well the temper of his rival and kept at a safe distance so he took vengeance on the poor girl If all the slave drivers had been called together I do not think a more cruel man than John Colburn and he too a northern man could have been found among them While living at the Missouri hotel a circumstance occurred which caused me great unhappiness My master sold my mother and all her children except myself They were sold to different persons in the city of St Louis III I WAS soon after taken from Mr Colburn's and hired to Elijah P Lovejoy who was at that time publisher and editor of the St Louis Times My work while with him was mainly in the printing office waiting on the hands working the press c Mr Lovejoy was a very good man and decidedly the best master that I had ever had I am chiefly indebted to him and to my employment in the printing office for what little learning I obtained while in slavery Though slavery is thought by some to be mild in Missouri when compared with the cotton sugar and rice growing states yet no part of our slave holding country is more noted for the barbarity of its inhabitants than St Louis It was here that Col Harney a United States officer whipped a slave woman to death It was here that Francis McIntosh a free colored man from Pittsburg was taken from the steamboat Flora and burned at the stake During a residence of eight years in this city numerous cases of extreme cruelty came under my own observation to record them all would occupy more space than could possibly be allowed in this little volume I shall therefore give but a few more in addition to what I have already related Capt J B Brant who resided near my master had a slave named John He was his body servant carriage driver c On one occasion while driving his master through the city the streets being very muddy and the horses going at a rapid rate some mud spattered upon a gentleman by the name of Robert More More was determined to be revenged Some three or four months after this occurrence he purchased John for the express purpose as he said to tame the d d nigger After the purchase he took him to a blacksmith's shop and had a ball and chain fastened to his leg and then put him to driving a yoke of oxen and kept him at hard labor until the iron around his leg was so worn into the flesh that it was thought mortification would ensue In addition to this John told me that his master whipped him regularly three times a week for the first two months and all this to tame him A more noble looking man than he was not to be found in all St Louis before he fell into the hands of More and a more degraded and spirit crushed looking being was never seen on a southern plantation after he had been subjected to this taming process for three months The last time that I saw him he had nearly lost the entire use of his limbs While living with Mr Lovejoy I was often sent on errands to the office of the Missouri Republican published by Mr Edward Charless Once while returning to the office with type I was attacked by several large boys sons of slave holders who pelted me with snow balls Having the heavy form of type in my hands I could not make my escape by running so I laid down the type and gave them battle They gathered around me pelting me with stones and sticks until they overpowered me and would have captured me if I had not resorted to my heels Upon my retreat they took possession of the type and what to do to regain it I could not devise Knowing Mr Lovejoy to be a very humane man I went to the office and laid the case before him He told me to remain in the office He took one of the apprentices with him and went after the type and soon returned with it but on his return informed me that Samuel McKinney had told him he would whip me because I had hurt his boy Soon after McKinney was seen making his way to the office by one of the printers who informed me of the fact and I made my escape through the back door McKinney not being able to find me on his arrival left the office in a great rage swearing that he would whip me to death A few days after as I was walking along Main street he seized me by the collar and struck me over the head five or six times with a large cane which caused the blood to gush from my nose and ears in such a manner that my clothes were completely saturated with blood After beating me to his satisfaction he let me go and I returned to the office so weak from the loss of blood that Mr Lovejoy sent me home to my master It was five weeks before I was able to walk again During this time it was necessary to have some one to supply my place at the office and I lost the situation After my recovery I was hired to Capt Otis Reynolds as a waiter on board the steamboat Enterprise owned by Messrs John and Edward Walsh commission merchants at St Louis This boat was then running on the upper Mississippi My employment on board was to wait on gentlemen and the captain being a good man the situation was a pleasant one to me but in passing from place to place and seeing new faces every day and knowing that they could go where they pleased I soon became unhappy and several times thought of leaving the boat at some landing place and trying to make my escape to Canada which I had heard much about as a place where the slave might live be free and be protected But whenever such thoughts would come into my mind my resolution would soon be shaken by the remembrance that my dear mother was a slave in St Louis and I could not bear the idea of leaving her in that condition She had often taken me upon her knee and told me how she had carried me upon her back to the field when I was an infant how often she had been whipped for leaving her work to nurse me and how happy I would appear when she would take me into her arms When these thoughts came over me I would resolve never to leave the land of slavery without my mother I thought that to leave her in slavery after she had undergone and suffered so much for me would be proving recreant to the duty which I owed to her Besides this I had three brothers and a sister there two of my brothers having died My mother my brothers Joseph and Millford and my sister Elizabeth belonged to Mr Isaac Mansfield formerly from one of the free states Massachusetts I believe He was a tinner by trade and carried on a large manufacturing establishment Of all my relatives mother was first and sister next One evening while visiting them I made some allusion to a proposed journey to Canada and sister took her seat by my side and taking my hand in hers said with tears in her eyes Brother you are not going to leave mother and your dear sister here without a friend are you I looked into her face as the tears coursed swiftly down her cheeks and bursting into tears myself said No I will never desert you and mother She clasped my hand in hers and said Brother you have often declared that you would not end your days in slavery I see no possible way in which you can escape with us and now brother you are on a steamboat where there is some chance for you to escape to a land of liberty I beseech you not to let us hinder you If we cannot get our liberty we do not wish to be the means of keeping you from a land of freedom I could restrain my feelings no longer and an outburst of my own feelings caused her to cease speaking upon that subject In opposition to their wishes I pledged myself not to leave them in the hand of the oppressor I took leave of them and returned to the boat and laid down in my bunk but sleep departed from mine eyes and slumber from mine eyelids A few weeks after on our downward passage the boat took on board at Hannibal a drove of slaves bound for the New Orleans market They numbered from fifty to sixty consisting of men and women from eighteen to forty years of age A drove of slaves on a southern steamboat bound for the cotton or sugar regions is an occurrence so common that no one not even the passengers appear to notice it though they clank their chains at every step There was however one in this gang that attracted the attention of the passengers and crew It was a beautiful girl apparently about twenty years of age perfectly white with straight light hair and blue eyes But it was not the whiteness of her skin that created such a sensation among those who gazed upon her it was her almost unparalleled beauty She had been on the boat but a short time before the attention of all the passengers including the ladies had been called to her and the common topic of conversation was about the beautiful slave girl She was not in chains The man who claimed this article of human merchandise was a Mr Walker a well known slave trader residing in St Louis There was a general anxiety among the passengers and crew to learn the history of the girl Her master kept close by her side and it would have been considered impudent for any of the passengers to have spoken to her and the crew were not allowed to have any conversation with them When we reached St Louis the slaves were removed to a boat bound for New Orleans and the history of the beautiful slave girl remained a mystery I remained on the boat during the season and it was not an unfrequent occurrence to have on board gangs of slaves on their way to the cotton sugar and rice plantations of the south Toward the latter part of the summer Captain Reynolds left the boat and I was sent home I was then placed on the farm under Mr Haskell the overseer As I had been some time out of the field and not accustomed to work in the burning sun it was very hard but I was compelled to keep up with the best of the hands I found a great difference between the work in a steamboat cabin and that in a corn field My master who was then living in the city soon after removed to the farm when I was taken out of the field to work in the house as a waiter Though his wife was very peevish and hard to please I much preferred to be under her control than the overseer's They brought with them Mr Sloane a Presbyterian minister Miss Martha Tulley a niece of theirs from Kentucky and their nephew William The latter had been in the family a number of years but the others were all new comers Mr Sloane was a young minister who had been at the South but a short time and it seemed as if his whole aim was to please the slaveholders especially my master and mistress He was intending to make a visit during the winter and he not only tried to please them but I think he succeeded admirably When they wanted singing he sung when they wanted praying he prayed when they wanted a story told he told a story Instead of his teaching my master theology my master taught theology to him While I was with Captain Reynolds my master got religion and new laws were made on the plantation Formerly we had the privilege of hunting fishing making splint brooms baskets c on Sunday but this was all stopped Every Sunday we were all compelled to attend meeting Master was so religious that he induced some others to join him in hiring preacher to preach to the slaves IV MY master had family worship night and morning At night the slaves were called in to attend but in the mornings they had to be at their work and master did all the praying My master and mistress were great lovers of mint julep and every morning a pitcher full was made of which they all partook freely not excepting little master William After drinking freely all round they would have family worship and then breakfast I cannot say but I loved the julep as well as any of them and during prayer was always careful to seat myself close to the table where it stood so as to help myself when they were all busily engaged in their devotions By the time prayer was over I was about as happy as any of them A sad accident happened one morning In helping myself and at at the same time keeping an eye on my old mistress I accidentally let the pitcher fall upon the floor breaking it in pieces and spilling the contents This was a bad affair for me for as soon as prayer was over I was taken and severely chastised My master's family consisted of himself his wife and their nephew William Moore He was taken into the family when only a few weeks of age His name being that of my own mine was changed for the purpose of giving precedence to his though I was his senior by ten or twelve years The plantation being four miles from the city I had to drive the family to church I always dreaded the approach of the Sabbath for during service I was obliged to stand by the horses in the hot broiling sun or in the rain just as it happened One Sabbath as we were driving past the house of D D a gentleman who owned a large baking establishment as I was sitting upon the box of the carriage which was very much elevated I saw Mr pursuing a slave around the yard with a long whip cutting him at every jump The man soon escaped from the yard and was followed by Mr They came running past us and the slave perceiving that he would be overtaken stopped suddenly and stumbled over him and falling on the stone pavement fractured one of his legs which crippled him for life The same gentleman but a short time previous tied up a woman of his by the name of Delphia and whipped her nearly to death yet he was a deacon in the Baptist church in good and regular standing Poor Delphia I was well acquainted with her and called to see her while upon her sick bed and I shall never forget her appearance She was a member of the same church with her master Soon after this I was hired out to Mr Walker the same man whom I have mentioned as having carried a gang of slaves down the river on the steamboat Enterprise Seeing me in the capacity of a steward on the boat and thinking that I would make a good hand to take care of slaves he determined to have me for that purpose and finding that my master would not sell me he hired me for the term of one year When I learned the fact of my having been hired to a negro speculator or a soul driver as they are generally called among slaves no one can tell my emotions Mr Walker had offered a high price for me as I afterwards learned but I suppose my master was restrained from selling me by the fact that I was a near relative of his On entering the service of Mr Walker I found that my opportunity of getting to a land of liberty was gone at least for the time being He had a gang of slaves in readiness to start for New Orleans and in a few days we were on our journey I am at a loss for language to express my feelings on that occasion Although my master had told me that he had not sold me and Mr Walker had told me that he had not purchased me I did not believe them and not until I had been to New Orleans and was on my return did I believe that I was not sold There was on the boat a large room on the lower deck in which the slaves were kept men and women promiscuously all chained two and two and a strict watch kept that they did not get loose for cases have occurred in which slaves have got off their chains and made their escape at landing places while the boats were taking in wood and with all our care we lost one woman who had been taken from her husband and children and having no desire to live without them in the agony of her soul jumped overboard and drowned herself She was not chained It was almost impossible to keep that part of the boat clean On landing at Natchez the slaves were all carried to the slave pen and there kept one week during which time several of them were sold Mr Walker fed his slaves well We took on board at St Louis several hundred pounds of bacon smoked meat and corn meal and his slaves were better fed than slaves generally were in Natchez so far as my observation extended At the end of a week we left for New Orleans the place of our final destination which we reached in two days Here the slaves were placed in a negro pen where those who wished to purchase could call and examine them The negro pen is a small yard surrounded by buildings from fifteen to twenty feet wide with the exception of a large gate with iron bars The slaves are kept in the buildings during the night and turned out into the yard during the day After the best of the stock was sold at private sale at the pen the balance were taken to the Exchange Coffee House Auction Rooms kept by Isaac L McCoy and sold at public auction After the sale of this lot of slaves we left New Orleans for St Louis V ON our arrival at St Louis I went to Dr Young and told him that I did not wish to live with Mr Walker any longer I was heart sick at seeing my fellow creatures bought and sold But the Dr had hired me for the year and stay I must Mr Walker again commenced purchasing another gang of slaves He bought a man of Colonel John O'Fallon who resided in the suburbs of the city This man had a wife and three children As soon as the purchase was made he was put in jail for safe keeping until we should be ready to start for New Orleans His wife visited him while there several times and several times when she went for that purpose was refused admittance In the course of eight or nine weeks Mr Walker had his cargo of human flesh made up There was in this lot a number of old men and women some of them with gray locks We left St Louis in the steamboat Carlton Captain Swan bound for New Orleans On our way down and before we reached Rodney the place where we made our first stop I had to prepare the old slaves for market I was ordered to have the old men's whiskers shaved off and the grey hairs plucked out where they were not too numerous in which case he had a preparation of blacking to color it and with a blacking brush we would put it on This was new business to me and was performed in a room where the passengers could not see us These slaves were also taught how old they were by Mr Walker and after going through the blacking process they looked ten or fifteen years younger and I am sure that some of those who purchased slaves of Mr Walker were dreadfully cheated especially in the ages of the slaves which they bought We landed at Rodney and the slaves were driven to the pen in the back part of the village Several were sold at this place during our stay of four or five days when we proceeded to Natchez There we landed at night and the gang were put in the warehouse until morning when they were driven to the pen As soon as the slaves are put in these pens swarms of planters may be seen in and about them They knew when Walker was expected as he always had the time advertised beforehand when he would be in Rodney Natchez and New Orleans These were the principal places where he offered his slaves for sale When at Natchez the second time I saw a slave very cruelly whipped He belonged to a Mr Broadwell a merchant who kept a store on the wharf The slave's name was Lewis I had known him several years as he was formerly from St Louis We were expecting a steamboat down the river in which we were to take passage for New Orleans Mr Walker sent me to the landing to watch for the boat ordering me to inform him on its arrival While there I went into the store to see Lewis I saw a slave in the store and asked him where Lewis was Said he They have got Lewis hanging between the heavens and the earth I asked him what he meant by that He told me to go into the warehouse and see I went in and found Lewis there He was tied up to a beam with his toes just touching the floor As there was no one in the warehouse but himself I inquired the reason of his being in that situation He said Mr Broadwell had sold his wife to a planter six miles from the city and that he had been to visit her that he went in the night expecting to return before daylight and went without his master's permission The patrol had taken him up before he reached his wife He was put in jail and his master had to pay for his catching and keeping and that was what he was tied up for Just as he finished his story Mr Broadwell came in and inquired what I was doing there I knew not what to say and while I was thinking what reply to make he struck me over the head with the cowhide the end of which struck me over my right eye sinking deep into the flesh leaving a scar which I carry to this day Before I visited Lewis he had received fifty lashes Mr Broadwell gave him fifty lashes more after I came out as I was afterwards informed by Lewis himself The next day we proceeded to New Orleans and put the gang in the same negro pen which we occupied before In a short time the planters came flocking to the pen to purchase slaves Before the slaves were exhibited for sale they were dressed and driven out into the yard Some were set to dancing some to jumping some to singing and some to playing cards This was done to make them appear cheerful and happy My business was to see that they were placed in those situations before the arrival of the purchasers and I have often set them to dancing when their cheeks were wet with tears As slaves were in good demand at that time they were all soon disposed of and we again set out for St Louis On our arrival Mr Walker purchased a farm five or six miles from the city He had no family but made a housekeeper of one of his female slaves Poor Cynthia I knew her well She was a quadroon and one of the most beautiful women I ever saw She was a native of St Lewis and bore an irreproachable character for virtue and propriety of conduct Mr Walker bought her for the New Orleans market and took her down with him on one of the trips that I made with him Never shall I forget the circumstances of that voyage On the first night that we were on board the steamboat he directed me to put her into a state room he had provided for her apart from the other slaves I had seen too much of the workings of slavery not to know what this meant I accordingly watched him into the state room and listened to hear what passed between them I heard him make his base offers and her reject them He told her that if she would accept his vile proposals he would take her back with him to St Louis and establish her as his housekeeper on his farm But if she persisted in rejecting them he would sell her as a field hand on the worst plantation on the river Neither threats nor bribes prevailed however and he retired disappointed of his prey The next morning poor Cynthia told me what had passed and bewailed her sad fate with floods of tears I comforted and encouraged her all I could but I foresaw but too well what the result must be Without entering into any further particulars suffice it to say that Walker performed his part of the contract at that time He took her back to St Louis established her as his mistress and housekeeper at his farm and before I left he had two children by her But mark the end Since I have been at the North I have been credibly informed that Walker has been married and as a previous measure sold poor Cynthia and her four children she having had two more since I came away into hopeless bondage He soon commenced purchasing to make up the third gang We took steamboat and went to Jefferson City a town on the Missouri river Here we landed and took stage for the interior of the state He bought a number of slaves as he passed the different farms and villages After getting twenty two or twenty three men and women we arrived at St Charles a village on the banks of the Missouri Here he purchased a woman who had a child in her arms appearing to be four or five weeks old We had been travelling by land for some days and were in hopes to have found a boat at this place for St Louis but were disappointed As no boat was expected for some days we started for St Louis by land Mr Walker had purchased two horses He rode one and I the other The slaves were chained together and we took up our line of march Mr Walker taking the lead and I bringing up the rear Though the distance was not more than twenty miles we did not reach it the first day The road was worse than any that I have ever travelled Soon after we left St Charles the young child grew very cross and kept up a noise during the greater part of the day Mr Walker complained of its crying several times and told the mother to stop the child's d d noise or he would The woman The slave trader Walker and the author driving a gang of slaves to the southern market tried to keep the child from crying but could not We put up at night with an acquaintance of Mr Walker and in the morning just as we were about to start the child again commenced crying Walker stepped up to her and told her to give the child to him The mother tremblingly obeyed He took the child by one arm as you would a cat by the leg walked into the house and said to the lady Madam I will make you a present of this little nigger it keeps such a noise that I can't bear it Thank you sir said the lady The mother as soon as she saw that her child was to be left ran up to Mr Walker and falling upon her knees begged him to let her have her child she clung around his legs and cried Oh my child my child master do let me have my child oh do do do I will stop its crying if you will only let me have it again When I saw this woman crying for her child so piteously a shudder a feeling akin to horror shot through my frame I have often since in imagination heard her crying for her child None but those who have been in a slave state and who have seen the American slave trader engaged in his nefarious traffic can estimate the sufferings their victims undergo If there is one feature of American slavery more abominable than another it is that which sanctions the buying and selling of human beings The African slave trade was abolished by the American Congress some twenty years since and now by the laws of the country if an American is found engaged in the African slave trade he is considered a pirate and if found guilty of such the penalty would be death Although the African slave trader has been branded as a pirate men are engaged in the traffic in slaves in this country who occupy high positions in society and hold offices of honor in the councils of the nation and not a few have made their fortunes by this business After the woman's child had been given away Mr Walker commanded her to return into the ranks with the other slaves Women who had children were not chained but those that had none were As soon as her child was disposed of she was chained in the gang The following song I have often heard the slaves sing when about to be carried to the far south It is said to have been composed by a slave See these poor souls from Africa Transported to America We are stolen and sold to Georgia Will you go along with me We are stolen and sold to Georgia Come sound the jubilee See wives and husbands sold apart Their children's screams will break my heart There 's a better day a coming Will you go along with me There 's a better day a coming Go sound the jubilee O gracious Lord when shall it be That we poor souls shall all be free Lord break them slavery powers Will you go along with me Lord break them slavery powers Go sound the jubilee Dear Lord dear Lord when slavery 'll cease Then we poor souls will have our peace There 's a better day a coming Will you go along with me There 's a better day a coming Go sound the jubilee We finally arrived at Mr Walker's farm He had a house built during our absence to put slaves in It was a kind of domestic jail The slaves were put in the jail at night and worked on the farm during the day They were kept here until the gang was completed when we again started for New Orleans on board the steamboat North America Capt Alexander Scott We had a large number of slaves in this gang One by the name of Joe Mr Walker was training up to take my place as my time was nearly out and glad was I We made our first stop at Vicksburg where we remained one week and sold several slaves Mr Walker though not a good master had not flogged a slave since I had been with him though he had threatened me The slaves were kept in the pen and he always put up at the best hotel and kept his wines in his room for the accommodation of those who called to negotiate with him for the purchase of slaves One day while we were at Vicksburg several gentlemen came to see him for that purpose and as usual the wine was called for I took the tray and started around with it and having accidentally filled some of the glasses too full the gentlemen spilled the wine on their clothes as they went to drink Mr Walker apologized to them for my carelessness but looked at me as though he would see me again on this subject After the gentlemen had left the room he asked me what I meant by my carelessness and said that he would attend to me The next morning he gave me a note to carry to the jailer and a dollar in money to give to him I suspected that all was not right so I went down near the landing where I met with a sailor and walking up to him asked him if he would be so kind as to read the note for me He read it over and then looked at me I asked him to tell me what was in it Said he They are going to give you hell Why said I He said This is a note to have you whipped and says that you have a dollar to pay for it He handed me back the note and off I started I knew not what to do but was determined not to be whipped I went up to the jail took a look at it and walked off again As Mr Walker was acquainted with the jailer I feared that I should be found out if I did not go and be treated in consequence of it still worse While I was meditating on the subject I saw a colored man about my size walk up and the thought struck me in a moment to send him with my note I walked up to him and asked him who he belonged to He said he was a free man and had been in the city but a short time I told him I had a note to go into the jail and get a trunk to carry to one of the steamboats but was so busily engaged that I could not do it although I had a dollar to pay for it He asked me if I would not give him the job I handed him the note and the dollar and off he started for the jail I watched to see that he went in and as soon as I saw the door close behind him I walked around the corner and took my station intending to see how my friend looked when he came out I had been there but a short time when a colored man came around the corner and said to another colored man with whom he was acquainted They are giving a nigger scissors in the jail What for said the other The man continued A nigger came into the jail and asked for the jailer The jailer came out and he handed him a note and said he wanted to get a trunk The jailer told him to go with him and he would give him the trunk So he took him into the room and told the nigger to give up the dollar He said a man had given him the dollar to pay for getting the trunk But that lie would not answer So they made him strip himself and then they tied him down and are now whipping him I stood by all the while listening to their talk and soon found out that the person alluded to was my customer I went into the street opposite the jail and concealed myself in such a manner that I could not be seen by any one coming out I had been there but a short time when the young man made his appearance and looked around for me I unobserved came forth from my hiding place behind a pile of brick and he pretty soon saw me and came up to me complaining bitterly saying that I had played a trick upon him I denied any knowledge of what the note contained and asked him what they had done to him He told me in substance what I heard the man tell who had come out of the jail Yes said he they whipped me and took my dollar and gave me this note He showed me the note which the jailer had given him telling him to give it to his master I told him I would give him fifty cents for it that being all the money I had He gave it to me and took his money He had received twenty lashes on his bare back with the negro whip I took the note and started for the hotel where I had left Mr Walker Upon reaching the hotel I handed it to a stranger whom I had not seen before and requested him to read it to me As near as I can recollect it was as follows DEAR SIR By your direction I have given your boy twenty lashes He is a very saucy boy and tried to make me believe that he did not belong to you and I put it on to him well for lying to me I remain Your obedient servant It is true that in most of the slave holding cities when a gentleman wishes his servants whipped he can send him to the jail and have it done Before I went in where Mr Walker was I wet my cheeks a little as though I had been crying He looked at me and inquired what was the matter I told him that I had never had such a whipping in my life and handed him the note He looked at it and laughed And so you told him that you did not belong to me Yes sir said I I did not know that there was any harm in that He told me I must behave myself if I did not want to be whipped again This incident shows how it is that slavery makes its victims lying and mean for which vices it afterwards reproaches them and uses them as arguments to prove that they deserve no better fate Had I entertained the same views of right and wrong which I now do I am sure I should never have practised the deception upon that poor fellow which I did I know of no act committed by me while in slavery which I have regretted more than that and I heartily desire that it may be at some time or other in my power to make him amends for his vicarious sufferings in my behalf VI IN a few days we reached New Orleans and arriving there in the night remained on board until morning While at New Orleans this time I saw a slave killed an account of which has been published by Theodore D Weld in his book entitled Slavery as it is The circumstances were as follows In the evening between seven and eight o'clock a slave came running down the levee followed by several men and boys The whites were crying out Stop that nigger stop that nigger while the poor panting slave in almost breathless accents was repeating I did not steal the meat I did not steal the meat The poor man at last took refuge in the river The whites who were in pursuit of him run on board of one of the boats to see if they could discover him They finally espied him under the bow of the steamboat Trenton They got a pike pole and tried to drive him from his hiding place When they would strike at him he would dive under the water The water was so cold that it soon became evident that he must come out or be drowned While they were trying to drive him from under the bow of the boat or drown him he would in broken and imploring accents say I did not steal the meat I did not steal the meat My master lives up the river I want to see my master I did not steal the meat Do let me go home to master After punching him and striking him over the head for some time he at last sunk in the water to rise no more alive On the end of the pike pole with which they were striking him was a hook which caught in his clothing and they hauled him up on the bow of the boat Some said he was dead others said he was playing possum while others kicked him to make him get up but it was of no use he was dead As soon as they became satisfied of this they commenced leaving one after another One of the hands on the boat informed the captain that they had killed the man and that the dead body was lying on the deck The captain came on deck and said to those who were remaining You have killed this nigger now take him off of my boat The captain's name was Hart The dead body was dragged on shore and left there I went on board of the boat where our gang of slaves were and during the whole night my mind was occupied with what I had seen Early in the morning I went on shore to see if the dead body remained there I found it in the same position that it was left the night before I watched to see what they would do with it It was left there until between eight and nine o'clock when a cart which takes up the trash out of the streets came along and the body was thrown in and in a few minutes more was covered over with dirt which they were removing from the streets During the whole time I did not see more than six or seven persons around it who from their manner evidently regarded it as no uncommon occurrence During our stay in the city I met with a young white man with whom I was well acquainted in St Louis He had been sold into slavery under the following circumstances His father was a drunkard and very poor with a family of five or six children The father died and left the mother to take care of and provide for the children as best she might The eldest was a boy named Burrill about thirteen years of age who did chores in a store kept by Mr Riley to assist his mother in procuring a living for the family After working with him two years Mr Riley took him to New Orleans to wait on him while in that city on a visit and when he returned to St Louis he told the mother of the boy that he had died with the yellow fever Nothing more was heard from him no one supposing him to be alive I was much astonished when Burrill told me his history Though I sympathized with him I could not assist him We were both slaves He was poor uneducated and without friends and if living is I presume still held as a slave After selling out this cargo of human flesh we returned to St Louis and my time was up with Mr Walker I had served him one year and it was the longest year I ever lived VII I WAS sent home and was glad enough to leave the service of one who was tearing the husband from the wife the child from the mother and the sister from the brother but a trial more severe and heart rending than any which I had yet met with awaited me My dear sister had been sold to a man who was going to Natchez and was lying in jail awaiting the hour of his departure She had expressed her determination to die rather than go to the far south and she was put in jail for safekeeping I went to the jail the same day that I arrived but as the jailer was not in I could not see her I went home to my master in the country and the first day after my return he came where I was at work and spoke to me very politely I knew from his appearance that something was the matter After talking to me about my several journeys to New Orleans with Mr Walker he told me that he was hard pressed for money and as he had sold my mother and all her children except me he thought it would be better to sell me than any other one and that as I had been used to living in the city he thought it probable that I would prefer it to a country life I raised up my head and looked him full in the face When my eyes caught his he immediately looked to the ground After a short pause I said Master mother has often told me that you are a near relative of mine and I have often heard you admit the fact and after you have hired me out and received as I once heard you say nine hundred dollars for my service after receiving this large sum will you sell me to be carried to New Orleans or some other place No said he I do not intend to sell you to a negro trader If I had wished to have done that I might have sold you to Mr Walker for a large sum but I would not sell you to a negro trader You may go to the city and find you a good master But said I I cannot find a good master in the whole city of St Louis Why said he Because there are no good masters in the state Do you not call me a good master If you were you would not sell me Now I will give you one week to find a master in and surely you can do it in that time The price set by my evangelical master upon my soul and body was the trifling sum of five hundred dollars I tried to enter into some arrangement by which I might purchase my freedom but he would enter into no such arrangement I set out for the city with the understanding that I was to return in a week with some one to become my new master Soon after reaching the city I went to the jail to learn if I could once more see my sister but could not gain admission I then went to mother and learned from her that the owner of my sister intended to start for Natchez in a few days I went to the jail again the next day and Mr Simonds the keeper allowed me to see my sister for the last time I cannot give a just description of the scene at that parting interview Never never can be erased from my heart the occurrences of that day When I entered the room where she was she was seated in one corner alone There were four other women in the same room belonging to the same man He had purchased them he said for his own use She was seated with her face towards the door where I entered yet she did not look up until I walked up to her As soon as she observed me she sprung up threw her arms around my neck leaned her head upon my breast and without uttering a word burst into tears As soon as she recovered herself sufficiently to speak she advised me to take mother and try to get out of slavery She said there was no hope for herself that she must live and die a slave After giving her some advice and taking from my finger a ring and placing it upon hers I bade her farewell forever and returned to my mother and then and there made up my mind to leave for Canada as soon as possible I had been in the city nearly two days and as I was to be absent only a week I thought best to get on my journey as soon as possible In conversing with mother I found her unwilling to make the attempt to reach a land of liberty but she counselled me to get my liberty if I could She said as all her children were in slavery she did not wish to leave them I could not bear the idea of leaving her among those pirates when there was a prospect of being able to get away from them After much persuasion I succeeded in inducing her to make the attempt to get away The time fixed for our departure was the next night I had with me a little money that I had received from time to time from gentlemen for whom I had done errands I took my scanty means and purchased some dried beef crackers and cheese which I carried to mother who had provided herself with a bag to carry it in I occasionally thought of my old master and of my mission to the city to find a new one I waited with the most intense anxiety for the appointed time to leave the land of slavery in search of a land of liberty The time at length arrived and we left the city just as the clock struck nine We proceeded to the upper part of the city where I had been two or three times during the day and selected a skiff to carry us across the river The boat was not mine nor did I know to whom it did belong neither did I care The boat was fastened with a small pole which with the aid of a rail I soon loosened from its moorings After hunting round and finding a board to use as an oar I turned to the city and bidding it a long farewell pushed off my boat The current running very swift we had not reached the middle of the stream before we were directly opposite the city We were soon upon the Illinois shore and leaping from the boat turned it adrift and the last I saw of it it was going down the river at good speed We took the main road to Alton and passed through just at daylight when we made for the woods where we remained during the day Our reason for going into the woods was that we expected that Mr Mansfield the man who owned my mother would start in pursuit of her as soon as he discovered that she was missing He also new that I had been in the city looking for a new master and we thought probably he would go out to my master's to see if he could find my mother and in so doing Dr Young might be led to suspect that I had gone to Canada to find a purchaser We remained in the woods during the day and as soon as darkness overshadowed the earth we started again on our gloomy way having no guide but the NORTH STAR We continued to travel by night and secrete ourselves in the woods by day and every night before emerging from our hiding place we would anxiously look for our friend and leader the NORTH STAR And in the language of Pierpont we might have exclaimed Star of the North while blazing day Pours round me its full tide of light And hides thy pale but faithful ray I too lie hid and long for night For night I dare not walk at noon Nor dare I trust the faithless moon Nor faithless man whose burning lust For gold hath riveted my chain No other leader can I trust But thee of even the starry train For all the host around thee burning Like faithless man keep turning turning In the dark top of southern pines I nestled when the driver's horn Called to the field in lengthening lines My fellows at the break of morn And there I lay till thy sweet face Looked in upon my 'hiding place ' Star of the North Thy light that no poor slave deceiveth Shall set me free VIII As we travelled towards a land of liberty my heart would at times leap for joy At other times being as I was almost constantly on my feet I felt as though I could travel no further But when I thought of slavery with its democratic whips its republican chains its evangelical blood hounds and its religious slave holders when I thought of all this paraphernalia of American democracy and religion behind me and the prospect of liberty before me I was encouraged to press forward my heart was strengthened and I forgot that I was tired or hungry On the eighth day of our journey we had a very heavy rain and in a few hours after it commenced we had not a dry thread upon our bodies This made our journey still more unpleasant On the tenth day we found ourselves entirely destitute of provisions and how to obtain any we could not tell We finally resolved to stop at some farm house and try to get something to eat We had no sooner determined to do this than we went to a house and asked them for some food We were treated with great kindness and they not only gave us something to eat but gave us provisions to carry with us They advised us to travel by day and lie by at night Finding ourselves about one hundred and fifty miles from St Louis we concluded that it would be safe to travel by daylight and did not leave the house until the next morning We travelled on that day through a thickly settled country and through one small village Though we were fleeing from a land of oppression our hearts were still there My dear sister and two beloved brothers were behind us and the idea of giving them up and leaving them forever made us feel sad But with all this depression of heart the thought that I should one day be free and call my body my own buoyed me up and made my heart leap for joy I had just been telling my mother how I should try to get employment as soon as we reached Canada and how I intended to purchase us a little farm and how I would earn money enough to buy sister and brothers and how happy we would be in our own FREE HOME when three men came up on horseback and ordered us to stop I turned to the one who appeared to be the principal man and asked him what he wanted He said he had a warrant to take us up The three immediately dismounted and one took from his pocket a handbill advertising us as runaways and offering a reward of two hundred dollars for our apprehension and delivery in the city of St Louis The advertisement had been put out by Isaac Mansfield and John Young While they were reading the advertisement mother looked me in the face and burst into tears A cold chill ran over me and such a sensation I never experienced before and I hope never to again They took out a rope and tied me and we were taken back about six miles to the house of the individual who appeared to be the leader We reached there about seven o'clock in the evening had supper and were separated for the night Two men remained in the room during the night Before the family retired to rest they were all called together to attend prayers The man who but a few hours before had bound my hands together with a strong cord read a from the The author and his mother arrested and carried back into slavery Bible and then offered up prayer just as though God had sanctioned the act he had just committed upon a poor panting fugitive slave The next morning a blacksmith came in and put a pair of handcuffs on me and we started on our journey back to the land of whips chains and Bibles Mother was not tied but was closely watched at night We were carried back in a wagon and after four days' travel we came in sight of St Louis I cannot describe my feelings upon approaching the city As we were crossing the ferry Mr Wiggins the owner of the ferry came up to me and inquired what I had been doing that I was in chains He had not heard that I had run away In a few minutes we were on the Missouri side and were taken directly to the jail On the way thither I saw several of my friends who gave me a nod of recognition as I passed them After reaching the jail we were locked up in different apartments IX I HAD been in jail but a short time when I heard that my master was sick and nothing brought more joy to my heart than that intelligence I prayed fervently for him not for his recovery but for his death I knew he would be exasperated at having to pay for my apprehension and knowing his cruelty I feared him While in jail I learned that my sister Elizabeth who was in prison when we left the city had been carried off four days before our arrival I had been in jail but a few hours when three negro traders learning that I was secured thus for running away came to my prison house and looked at me expecting that I would be offered for sale Mr Mansfield the man who owned mother came into the jail as soon as Mr Jones the man who arrested us informed him that he had brought her back He told her that he would not whip her but would sell her to a negro trader or take her to New Orleans himself After being in jail about one week master sent a man to take me our of jail and send me home I was taken out and carried home and the old man was well enough to sit up He had me brought into the room where he was and as I entered he asked me where I had been I told him I had acted according to his orders He had told me to look for a master and I had been to look for one He answered that he did not tell me to go to Canada to look for a master I told him that as I had served him faithfully and had been the means of putting a number of hundreds of dollars into his pocket I thought I had a right to my liberty He said he had promised my father that I should not be sold to supply the New Orleans market or he would sell me to a negro trader I was ordered to go into the field to work and was closely watched by the overseer during the day and locked up at night The overseer gave me a severe whipping on the second day that I was in the field I had been at home but a short time when master was able to ride to the city and on his return he informed me that he had sold me to Samuel Willi a merchant tailor I knew Mr Willi I had lived with him three or four months some years before when he hired me of my master Mr Willi was not considered by his servants as a very bad man nor was he the best of masters I went to my new home and found my new mistress very glad to see me Mr Willi owned two servants before he purchased me Robert and Charlotte Robert was an excellent white washer and hired his time from his master paying him one dollar per day besides taking care of himself He was known in the city by the name of Bob Music Charlotte was an old woman who attended to the cooking washing c Mr Willi was not a wealthy man and did not feel able to keep many servants around his house so he soon decided to hire me out and as I had been accustomed to service in steamboats he gave me the privilege of finding such employment I soon secured a situation on board the steamer Otto Capt J B Hill which sailed from St Louis to Independence Missouri My former master Dr Young did not let Mr Willi know that I had run away or he would not have permitted me to go on board a steamboat The boat was not quite ready to commence running and therefore I had to remain with Mr Willi But during this time I had to undergo a trial for which I was entirely unprepared My mother who had been in jail since her return until the present time was now about being carried to New Orleans to die on a cotton sugar or rice plantation I had been several times to the jail but could obtain no interview with her I ascertained however the time the boat in which she was to embark would sail and as I had not seen mother since her being thrown into prison I felt anxious for the hour of sailing to come At last the day arrived when I was to see her for the first time after our painful separation and for aught that I knew for the last time in this world At about ten o'clock in the morning I went on board of the boat and found her there in company with fifty or sixty other slaves She was chained to another woman On seeing me she immediately dropped her head upon her heaving bosom She moved not neither did she weep Her emotions were too deep for tears I approached threw my arms around her neck kissed her and fell upon my knees begging her forgiveness for I thought myself to blame for her sad condition for if I had not persuaded her to accompany me she would not then have been in chains She finally raised her head looked me in the face and such a look none but an angel can give and said My dear son you are not to blame for my being here You have done nothing more nor less than your duty Do not I pray you weep for me I cannot last long upon a cotton plantation I feel that my heavenly Master will soon call me home and then I shall be out of the hands of the slave holders I could bear no more my heart struggled to free itself from the human form In a moment she saw Mr Mansfield coming toward that part of the boat and she whispered into my ear My child we must soon part to meet no more this side of the grave You have ever said that you would not die a slave that you would be a freeman Now try to get your liberty You will soon have no one to look after but yourself and just as she whispered the last sentence into my ear Mansfield came up to me and with an oath said Leave here this instant you have been the means of my losing one hundred dollars to get this wench back at the same time kicking me with a heavy pair of boots As I left her she gave one shriek saying God be with you It was the last time that I saw her and the last word I heard her utter I walked on shore The bell was tolling The boat was about to start I stood with a heavy heart waiting to see her leave the wharf As I thought of my mother I could but feel that I had lost the glory of my life My blessing and my pride I half forgot the name of slave When she was by my side The love of liberty that had been burning in my bosom had well nigh gone out I felt as though I was ready to die The boat moved gently from the wharf and while she glided down the river I realized that my mother was indeed Gone gone sold and gone To the rice swamp dank and lone After the boat was out of sight I returned home but my thoughts were so absorbed in what I had witnessed that I knew not what I was about half of the time Night came but it brought no sleep to my eyes In a few days the boat upon which I was to work being ready I went on board to commence This employment suited me better than living in the city and I remained until the close of navigation though it proved anything but pleasant The captain was a drunken profligate hard hearted creature not knowing how to treat himself or any other person The boat on its second trip brought down Mr Walker the man of whom I have spoken in a previous as hiring my time He had between one and two hundred slaves chained and manacled Among them was a man that formerly belonged to my old master's brother Aaron Young His name was Solomon He was a preacher and belonged to the same church with his master I was glad to see the old man He wept like a child when he told me how he had been sold from his wife and children The boat carried down while I remained on board four or five gangs of slaves Missouri though a comparatively new state is very much engaged in raising slaves to supply the southern market In a former I have mentioned that I was once in the employ of a slave trader or driver as he is called at the south For fear that some may think that I have misrepresented a slave driver I will here give an extract from a paper published in a slave holding state Tennessee called the Millennial Trumpeter Droves of negroes chained together in dozens and scores and hand cuffed have been driven through our country in numbers far surpassing any previous year and these vile slave drivers and dealers are swarming like buzzards around a carrion Through this county you cannot pass a few miles in the great roads without having every feeling of humanity insulted and lacerated by this spectacle nor can you go into any county or any neighborhood scarcely without seeing or hearing of some of these despicable creatures called negro drivers Who is a negro driver One whose eyes dwell with delight on lacerated bodies of helpless men women and children whose soul feels diabolical raptures at the chains and hand cuffs and cart whips for inflicting tortures on weeping mothers torn from helpless babes and on husbands and wives torn asunder forever Dark and revolting as is the picture here drawn it is from the pen of one living in the midst of slavery But though these men may cant about negro drivers and tell what despicable creatures they are who is it I ask that supplies them with the human beings that they are tearing asunder I answer as far as I have any knowledge of the state where I came from that those who raise slaves for the market are to be found among all classes from Thomas H Benton down to the lowest political demagogue who may be able to purchase a woman for the purpose of raising stock and from the doctor of divinity down to the most humble lay member in the church It was not uncommon in St Louis to pass by an auction stand and behold a woman upon the auction block and hear the seller crying out How much is offered for this woman She is a good cook good washer a good obedient servant She has got religion Why should this man tell the purchasers that she has religion I answer because in Missouri and as far as I have any knowledge of slavery in the other states the religious teaching consists in teaching the slave that he must never strike a white man that God made him for a slave and that when whipped he must not find fault for the Bible says He that knoweth his master's will and doeth it not shall be beaten with many stripes And slave holders find such religion very profitable to them After leaving the steamer Otto I resided at home in Mr Willi's family and again began to lay plans for making my escape from slavery The anxiety to be a freeman would not let me rest day or night I would think of the northern cities that had heard so much about of Canada where so many of my acquaintances had found a refuge I would dream at night that I was in Canada a freeman and on waking in the morning weep to find myself so sadly mistaken I would think of Victoria's domain And in a moment I seemed to be there But the fear of being taken again Soon hurried me back to despair Mr Willi treated me better than Dr Young ever had but instead of making me contented and happy it only rendered me the more miserable for it enabled me better to appreciate liberty Mr Willi was a man who loved money as most men do and without looking for an opportunity to sell me he found one in the offer of Captain Enoch Price a steamboat owner and commission merchant living in the city of St Louis Captain Price tendered seven hundred dollars which was two hundred more than Mr Willi had paid He therefore thought best to accept the offer I was wanted for a carriage driver and Mrs Price was very much pleased with the captain's bargain His family consisted of himself wife one child and three servants besides myself one man and two women Mrs Price was very proud of her servants always keeping them well dressed and as soon as I had been purchased she resolved to have a new carriage And soon one was procured and all preparations were made for a turn out in grand style I being the driver One of the female servants was a girl some eighteen or twenty years of age named Maria Mrs Price was very soon determined to have us united if she could so arrange matters She would often urge upon me the necessity of having a wife saying that it would be so pleasant for me to take one in the same family But getting married while in slavery was the last of my thoughts and had I been ever so inclined I should not have married Maria as my love had already gone in another quarter Mrs Price soon found out that her efforts at this match making between Maria and myself would not prove successful She also discovered or thought she had that I was rather partial to a girl named Eliza who was owned by Dr Mills This induced her at once to endeavor the purchase of Eliza so great was her desire to get me a wife Before making the attempt however she deemed it best to talk to me a little upon the subject of love courtship and marriage Accordingly one afternoon she called me into her room telling me to take a chair and sit down I did so thinking it rather strange for servants are not very often asked thus to sit down in the same room with the master or mistress She said that she had found out that I did not care enough about Maria to marry her I told her that was true She then asked me if there was not a girl in the city that I loved Well now this was coming into too close quarters with me People generally don't like to tell their love stories to everybody that may think fit to ask about them and it was so with me But after blushing a while and recovering myself I told her that I did not want a wife She then asked me if I did not think something of Eliza I told her that I did She then said that if I wished to marry Eliza she would purchase her if she could I gave but little encouragement to this proposition as I was determined to make another trial to get my liberty and I knew that if I should have a wife I should not be willing to leave her behind and if I should attempt to bring her with me the chances would be difficult for success However Eliza was purchased and brought into the family X BUT the more I thought of the trap laid by Mrs Price to make me satisfied with my new home by getting me a wife the more I determined never to marry any woman on earth until I should get my liberty But this secret I was compelled to keep to myself which placed me in a very critical position I must keep upon good terms with Mrs Price and Eliza I therefore promised Mrs Price that I would marry Eliza but said that I was not then ready And I had to keep upon good terms with Eliza for fear that Mrs Price would find out that I did not intend to get married I have here spoken of marriage and it is very common among slaves themselves to talk of it And it is common for slaves to be married or at least to have the marriage ceremony performed But there is no such thing as slaves being lawfully married There has never yet a case occurred where a slave has been tried for bigamy The man may have as many women as he wishes and the women as many men and the law takes no cognizance of such acts among slaves And in fact some masters when they have sold the husband from the wife compel her to take another There lived opposite Captain Price's Doctor Farrar well known in St Louis He sold a man named Ben to one of the traders He also owned Ben's wife and in a few days he compelled Sally that was her name to marry Peter another man belonging to him I asked Sally why she married Peter so soon after Ben was sold She said because master made her do it Mr John Calvert who resided near our place had a woman named Lavinia She was quite young and a man to whom she was about to be married was sold and carried into the country near St Charles about twenty miles from St Louis Mr Calvert wanted her to get a husband but she had resolved not to marry any other man and she refused Mr Calvert whipped her in such a manner that it was thought she would die Some of the citizens had him arrested but it was soon hushed up And that was the last of it The woman did not die but it would have been the same if she had Captain Price purchased me in the month of October and I remained with him until December when the family made a voyage to New Orleans in a boat owned by himself and named the Chester I served on board as one of the stewards On arriving at New Orleans about the middle of the month the boat took in freight for Cincinnati and it was decided that the family should go up the river in her and what was of more interest to me I was to accompany them The long looked for opportunity to make my escape from slavery was near at hand Captain Price had some fears as to the propriety of taking me near a free state or a place where it was likely I could run away with a prospect of liberty He asked me if I had ever been in a free state Oh yes said I I have been in Ohio my master carried me into that state once but I never liked a free state It was soon decided that it would be safe to take me with them and what made it more safe Eliza was on the boat with us and Mrs Price to try me asked if I thought as much as ever of Eliza I told her that Eliza was very dear to me indeed and that nothing but death should part us It was the same as if we were married This had the desired effect The boat left New Orleans and proceeded up the river I had at different times obtained little sums of money which I had reserved for a rainy day I procured some cotton cloth and made me a bag to carry provisions in The trials of the past were all lost in hopes for the future The love of liberty that had been burning in my bosom for years and had been well nigh extinguished was now resuscitated At night when all around was peaceful I would walk the decks meditating upon my happy prospects I should have stated that before leaving St Louis I went to an old man named Frank a slave owned by a Mr Sarpee This old man was very distinguished not only among the slave population but also the whites as a fortune teller He was about seventy years of age something over six feet high and very slender Indeed he was so small around his body that it looked as though it was not strong enough to hold up his head Uncle Frank was a very great favorite with the young ladies who would go to him in great numbers to get their fortunes told And it was generally believed that he could really penetrate into the mysteries of futurity Whether true or not he had the name and that is about half of what one needs in this gullible age I found Uncle Frank seated in the chimney corner about ten o'clock at night As soon as I entered the old man left his seat I watched his movement as well as I could by the dim light of the fire He soon lit a lamp and coming up looked me full in the face saying Well my son you have come to get uncle to tell your fortune have you Yes said I But how the old man should know what I came for I could not tell However I paid the fee of twenty five cents and he commenced by looking into a gourd filled with water Whether the old man was a prophet or the son of a prophet I cannot say but there is one thing certain many of his predictions were verified I am no believer in soothsaying yet I am sometimes at a loss to know how Uncle Frank could tell so accurately what would occur in the future Among the many things he told was one which was enough to pay me for all the trouble of hunting him up It was that I should be free He further said that in trying to get my liberty I would meet with many severe trials I thought to myself any fool could tell me that The first place in which we landed in a free state was Cairo a small village at the mouth of the Ohio river We remained here but a few hours when we proceeded to Louisville After unloading some of the cargo the boat started on her upward trip The next day was the first of January I had looked forward to New Year's day as the commencement of a new era in the history of my life I had decided upon leaving the peculiar institution that day During the last night that I served in slavery I did not close my eyes a single moment When not thinking of the future my mind dwelt on the past The love of a dear mother a dear sister and three dear brothers yet living caused me to shed many tears If I could only have been assured of their being dead I should have felt satisfied but I imagined I saw my dear mother in the cotton field followed by a merciless task master and no one to speak a consoling word to her I beheld my dear sister in the hands of a slave driver and compelled to submit to his cruelty None but one placed in such a situation can for a moment imagine the intense agony to which these reflections subjected me XI At last the time for action arrived The boat landed at a point which appeared to me the place of all others to start from I found that it would be impossible to carry anything with me but what was upon my person I had some provisions and a single suit of clothes about half worn When the boat was discharging her cargo and the passengers engaged carrying their baggage on and off shore I improved the opportunity to convey myself with my little effects on land Taking up a trunk I went up the wharf and was soon out of the crowd I made directly for the woods where I remained until night knowing well that I could not travel even in the state of Ohio during the day without danger of being arrested I had long since made up my mind that I would not trust myself in the hands of any man white or colored The slave is brought up to look upon every white man as an enemy to him and his race and twenty one years in slavery had taught me that there were traitors even among colored people After dark I emerged from the woods into a narrow path which led me into the main travelled road But I knew not which way to go I did not know north from south east from west I looked in vain for the North Star a heavy cloud hid it from my view I walked up and down the road until near midnight when the clouds disappeared and I welcomed the sight of my friend truly the slave's friend the North Star As soon as I saw it I knew my course and before daylight I travelled twenty or twenty five miles It being in the winter I suffered intensely from the cold being without an overcoat and my other clothes rather thin for the season I was provided with a tinder box so that I could make up a fire when necessary And but for this I should certainly have frozen to death for I was determined not to go to any house for shelter I knew of a man belonging to Gen Ashly of St Louis who had run away near Cincinnati on the way to Washington but had been caught and carried back into slavery and I felt that a similar fate awaited me should I be seen by any one I travelled at night and lay by during the day On the fourth day my provisions gave out and then what to do I could not tell Have something to eat I must but how to get it was the question On the first night after my food was gone I went to a barn on the road side and there found some ears of corn I took ten or twelve of them and kept on my journey During the next day while in the woods I roasted my corn and feasted upon it thanking God that I was so well provided for My escape to a land of freedom now appeared certain and the prospects of the future occupied a great part of my thoughts What should be my occupation was a subject of much anxiety to me and the next thing what should be my name I have before stated that my old master Dr Young had no children of his own but had with him a nephew the son of his brother Benjamin Young When this boy was brought to Dr Young his name being William the same as mine my mother was ordered to change mine to something else This at the time I thought to be one of the most cruel acts that could be committed upon my rights and I received several very severe whippings for telling people that my name was William after orders were given to change it Though young I was old enough to place a high appreciation upon my name It was decided however to call me Sandford and this name I was known by not only upon my master's plantation but up to the time that I made my escape I was sold under the name of Sandford But as soon as the subject came to my mind I resolved on adopting my old name of William and let Sandford go by the board for I always hated it Not because there was anything peculiar in the name but because it had been forced upon me It is sometimes common at the south for slaves to take the name of their masters Some have a legitimate right to do so But I always detested the idea of being called by the name of either of my masters And as for my father I would rather have adopted the name of Friday and been known as the servant of some Robinson Crusoe than to have taken his name So I was not only hunting for my liberty but also hunting for a name though I regarded the latter as of little consequence if I could but gain the former Travelling along the road I would sometimes speak to myself sounding my name over by way of getting used to it before I should arrive among civilized human beings On the fifth or six day it rained very fast and froze about as fast as it fell so that my clothes were one glare of ice I travelled on at night until I became so chilled and benumbed the wind blowing into my face that I found it impossible to go any further and accordingly took shelter in a barn where I was obliged to walk about to keep from freezing I have ever looked upon that night as the most eventful part of my escape from slavery Nothing but the providence of God and that old barn saved me from freezing to death I received a very severe cold which settled upon my lungs and from time to time my feet had been frost bitten so that it was with difficulty I could walk In this situation I travelled two days when I found that I must seek shelter somewhere or die The thought of death was nothing frightful to me compared with that of being caught and again carried back into slavery Nothing but the prospect of enjoying liberty could have induced me to undergo such trials for Behind I left the whips and chains Before me were sweet Freedom's plains This and this alone cheered me onward But I at last resolved to seek protection from the inclemency of the weather and therefore I secured myself behind some logs and brush intending to wait there until some one should pass by for I thought it probable that I might see some colored person or if not some one who was not a slave holder for I had an idea that I should know a slaveholder as far as I could see him The first person that passed was a man in a buggy wagon He looked too genteel for me to hail him Very soon another passed by on horseback I attempted to speak to him but fear made my voice fail me As he passed I left my hiding place and was approaching the road when I observed an old man walking towards me leading a white horse He had on a broad brimmed hat and a very long coat and was evidently walking for exercise As soon as I saw him and observed his dress I thought to myself You are the man that I have been looking for Nor was I mistaken He was the very man On approaching me he asked me if I was not a slave I looked at him some time and then asked him if he knew of any one who would help me as I was sick He answered that he would but again asked if I was not a slave I told him I was He then said that I was in a very pro slavery neighborhood and if I would wait until he went home he would get a covered wagon for me I promised to remain He mounted his horse and was soon out of sight After he was gone I meditated whether to wait or not being apprehensive that he had gone for some one to arrest me But I finally concluded to remain until he should return removing some few rods to watch his movements After a suspense of an hour and a half or more he returned with a two horse covered wagon such as are usually seen under the shed of a Quaker meeting house on Sundays and Thursdays for the old man proved to be a Quaker of the George Fox stamp He took me to his house but it was some time before I could be induced to enter it not until the old lady came out did I venture into the house I thought I saw something in the old lady's cap that told me I was not only safe but welcome in her house I was not however prepared to receive their hospitalities The only fault I found with them was their being too kind I had never had a white man to treat me as an equal and the idea of a white lady waiting on me at the table was still worse Though the table was loaded with the good things of this life I could not eat I thought if I could only be allowed the privilege of eating in the kitchen I should be more than satisfied Finding that I could not eat the old lady who was a Thompsonian made me a cup of composition or number six but it was so strong and hot that I called it number seven However I soon found myself at home in this family On different occasions when telling these facts I have been asked how I felt upon finding myself regarded as a man by a white family especially just having run away from one I cannot say that I have ever answered the question yet The fact that I was in all probability a freeman sounded in my ears like a charm I am satisfied that none but a slave could place such an appreciation upon liberty as I did at that time I wanted to see mother and sister that I might tell them I was free I wanted to see my fellow slaves in St Louis and let them know that the chains were no longer upon my limbs I wanted to see Captain Price and let him learn from my own lips that I was no more a chattel but a man I was anxious too thus to inform Mrs Price that she must get another coachman And I wanted to see Eliza more than I did either Mr or Mrs Price The fact that I was a freeman could walk talk eat and sleep as a man and no one to stand over me with the blood clotted cow hide all this made me feel that I was not myself The kind friend that had taken me in was named Wells Brown He was a devoted friend of the slave but was very old and not in the enjoyment of good health After being by the fire awhile I found that my feet had been very much frozen I was seized with a fever which threatened to confine me to my bed But my Thompsonian friends soon raised me treating me as kindly as if I had been one of their own children I remained with them twelve or fifteen days during which time they made me some clothing and the old gentleman purchased me a pair of boots I found that I was about fifty or sixty miles from Dayton in the State of Ohio and between one and two hundred miles from Cleaveland on Lake Erie a place I was desirous of reaching on my way to Canada This I know will sound strangely to the ears of people in foreign lands but it is nevertheless true An American citizen was fleeing from a democratic republican Christian government to receive protection under the monarchy of Great Britain While the people of the United States boast of their freedom they at the same time keep three millions of their own citizens in chains and while I am seated here in sight of Bunker Hill Monument writing this narrative I am a slave and no law not even in Massachusetts can protect me from the hands of the slave holder Before leaving this good Quaker friend he inquired what my name was besides William I told him that I had no other name Well said he thee must have another name Since thee has got out of slavery thee has become a man and men always have two names I told him that he was the first man to extend the hand of friendship to me and I would give him the privilege of naming me If I name thee said he I shall call thee Wells Brown after myself But said I I am not willing to lose my name of William As it was taken from me once against my will I am not willing to part with it again upon any terms Then said he I will call thee William Wells Brown So be it said I and I have been known by that name ever since I left the house of my first white friend Wells Brown After giving me some little change I again started for Canada In four days I reached a public house and went into warm myself I there learned that some fugitive slaves had just passed through the place The men in the bar room were talking about it and I thought that it must have been myself they referred to and I was therefore afraid to start fearing they would seize me but I finally mustered courage enough and took my leave As soon as I was out of sight I went into the woods and remained there until night when I again regained the road and travelled on until next day Not having had any food for nearly two days I was faint with hunger and was in a dilemma what to do as the little cash supplied me by my adopted father and which had contributed to my comfort was now all gone I however concluded to go to a farm house and ask for something to eat On approaching the door of the first one presenting itself I knocked and was soon met by a man who asked me what I wanted I told him that I would like something to eat He asked me where I was from and where I was going I replied that I had come some way and was going to Cleaveland After hesitating a moment or two he told me that he could give me nothing to eat adding that if I would work I could get something to eat I felt bad being thus refused something to sustain nature but did not dare tell him that I was a slave Just as I was leaving the door with a heavy heart a woman who proved to be the wife of this gentleman came to the door and asked her husband what I wanted He did not seem inclined to inform her She therefore asked me herself I told her that I had asked for something to eat After a few other questions she told me to come in and that she would give me something to eat I walked up to the door but the husband remained in the passage as if unwilling to let me enter She asked him two or three times to get out of the way and let me in But as he did not move she pushed him on one side bidding me walk in I was never before so glad to see a woman push a man aside Ever since that act I have been in favor of woman's rights After giving me as much food as I could eat she presented me with ten cents all the money then at her disposal accompanied with a note to a friend a few miles further on the road Thanking this angel of mercy from an overflowing heart I pushed on my way and in three days arrived at Cleaveland Ohio Being an entire stranger in this place it was difficult for me to find where to stop I had no money and the lake being frozen I saw that I must remain until the opening of the navigation or go to Canada by way of Buffalo But believing myself to be somewhat out of danger I secured an engagement at the Mansion House as a table waiter in payment for my board The proprietor however whose name was E M Segur in a short time hired me for twelve dollars a month on which terms I remained until spring when I found good employment on board a lake steamboat I purchased some books and at leisure moments perused them with considerable advantage to myself While at Cleaveland I saw for the first time an anti slavery newspaper It was the Genius of Universal Emancipation published by Benjamin Lundy and though I had no home I subscribed for the paper It was my great desire being out of slavery myself to do what I could for the emancipation of my brethren yet in chains and while on Lake Erie I found many opportunities of helping their cause along It is well known that a great number of fugitives make their escape to Canada by way of Cleaveland and while on the lakes I always made arrangement to carry them on the boat to Buffalo or Detroit and thus effect their escape to the promised land The friends of the slave knowing that I would transport them without charge never failed to have a delegation when the boat arrived at Cleaveland I have sometimes had four or five on board at one time In the year I conveyed from the first of May to the first of December sixty nine fugitives over Lake Erie to Canada In I visited Malden in Upper Canada and counted seventeen in that small village whom I had assisted in reaching Canada Soon after coming north I subscribed for the Liberator edited by that champion of freedom William Lloyd Garrison I had heard nothing of the anti slavery movement while in slavery and as soon as I found that my enslaved countrymen had friends who were laboring for their liberation I felt anxious to join them and give what aid I could to the cause I early embraced the temperance cause and found that a temperance reformation was needed among my colored brethren In company with a few friends I commenced a temperance reformation among the colored people in the city of Buffalo and labored three years in which time a society was built up numbering over five hundred out of a population of less than seven hundred In the autumn impressed with the importance of spreading anti slavery truth as a means to bring about the abolition of slavery I commenced lecturing as an agent of the western New York Anti Slavery Society and have ever since devoted my time to the cause of my enslaved countrymen XII DURING the autumn of a slaveholder by the name of Bacon Tate from the State of Tennessee came to the north in search of fugitives from slavery On his arrival at Buffalo he heard of two of the most valuable of the slaves that he was in pursuit of They were residing in St Catharine's in Upper Canada some twenty five miles from Buffalo After hearing that they were in Canada one would have supposed that Tate would have given up all hope of getting them But not so Bacon Tate was a man who had long been engaged in the slave trade and previous to that had been employed as a negro driver In these two situations he had gained the name of being the most complete negro breaker in that part of Tennessee where he resided He was as unfeeling and as devoid of principle as a man could possibly be This made him the person above all others to be selected to be put on the track of the fugitive slave He had not only been commissioned to catch Stanford and his wife the two valuable slaves already alluded to but he had the names of some twenty others Many slaves had made their escape from the vicinity of Nashville and the slaveholders were anxious to have some caught that they might make an example of them And Tate anxious to sustain his high reputation as a negro catcher left no stone unturned to carry out his nefarious objects Stanford and his little family were as happily situated as fugitives can be who make their escape to Canada in the cold season of the year Tate on his arrival at Buffalo took lodgings at the Eagle Tavern the best house at that time in the city And here he began to lay his plans to catch and carry back into slavery those men and women who had undergone so much to get their freedom He soon became acquainted with a profligate colored woman who was a servant in the hotel and who was as unprincipled as himself This woman was sent to St Catharine's to spy out the situation of Stanford's family Under the pretence of wishing to get board in the family and at the same time offering to pay a week's board in advance she was taken in After remaining with them three or four days the spy returned to Buffalo and informed Tate how they were situated By the liberal use of money Tate soon found those who were willing to do his bidding A carriage was hired and four men employed to go with it to St Catharine's and to secure their victims during the night The carriage with the kidnappers crossed the Niagara river at Black Rock on Saturday evening about seven o'clock and went on its way towards St Catharine's no one suspecting in the least that they were after fugitive slaves About twelve o'clock that night they attacked Stanford's dwelling by breaking in the door They found the family asleep and of course met with no obstacle whatever in tying gagging and forcing them into the carriage The family had one child about six weeks old That was kept at its mother's breast to keep it quiet The carriage re crossed the river at the same place the next morning at sunrise and proceeded to Buffalo where it remained a short time and after changing horses and leaving some of its company it proceeded on its journey The carriage being closely covered no one had made the least discovery as to its contents But some time during the morning a man who was neighbor to Stanford and who resided but a short distance from him came on an errand and finding the house deserted and seeing the most of the family's clothes lying on the floor and seeing here and there stains of blood soon gave the alarm and the neighbors started in every direction to see if they could find the kidnappers One man got on the track of the carriage and followed it to the ferry at Black Rock where he heard that it had crossed some three hours before He went on to Buffalo and gave the alarm to the colored people of that place The colored people of Buffalo are noted for their promptness in giving aid to the fugitive slave The alarm was given just as the bells were ringing for church I was in company with five or six others when I heard that a brother slave with his family had been seized and dragged from his home during the night previous We started on a run for the livery stable where we found as many more of our own color trying to hire horses to go in search of the fugitives There were two roads which the kidnappers could take and we were at some loss to know which to take ourselves But we soon determined to be on the right track and so divided our company one half taking the road to Erie the other taking the road leading to Hamburgh I was among those who took the latter We travelled on at a rapid rate until we came within half a mile of Hamburgh Corners when we met a man on the side of the road on foot who made signs to us to stop We halted for a moment when he informed us that the carriage that we were in pursuit of was at the public house and that he was then in search of some of his neighbors to assemble and to demand of the kidnappers the authority by which they were taking these people into slavery We proceeded to the tavern where we found the carriage standing in front of the door with a pair of fresh horses ready to proceed on their journey The kidnappers seeing us coming took their victims into a room and locked the door and fastened down the windows We all dismounted fastened our horses and entered the house We found four or five persons in the bar room who seemed to rejoice as we entered One of our company demanded the opening of the door while others went out and surrounded the house The kidnappers stationed one of their number at the door and another at the window They refused to let us enter the room and the tavern keeper who was more favorable to us than we had anticipated said to us Boys get into the room in any way that you can the house is mine and I give you the liberty to break in through the door or window This was all that we wanted and we were soon making preparations to enter the room at all hazards Those within had warned us that if we should attempt to enter they would shoot the first one One of our company who had obtained a crow bar went to the window and succeeded in getting it under the sash and soon we had the window up and the kidnappers together with their victims in full view One of the kidnappers while we were raising the window kept crying at the top of his voice I'll shoot I'll shoot but no one seemed to mind him As soon as they saw that we were determined to rescue the slaves at all hazards they gave up one of their number telling us that we might come in The door was thrown open and we entered and there found Stanford seated in one corner of the room with his hands tied behind him and his clothing what little he had on much stained with blood Near him was his wife with her child but a few weeks old in her arms Neither of them had anything on except their night clothes They had both been gagged to keep them from alarming the people and had been much beaten and bruised when first attacked by the kidnappers Their countenances lighted up the moment we entered the room The most of those who made up our company were persons who had made their escape from slavery and who knew its horrors from personal experience and who had left near and dear relatives behind them And we knew how to feel for those in bonds as bound with them The woman who had betrayed them and who was in the house at the time they were taken had been persuaded by Tate to go on with him to Tennessee She had accompanied them from Canada and we found her in the same room with Stanford and his wife As soon as she found that we were about to enter the room she ran under the bed We knew nothing of her being in the room until Stanford pointed to the bed and said Under there is our betrayer She was soon hauled out and it was as much as some of us could do to keep the others from lynching her upon the spot The curses came thick and fast from a majority of the company But nothing attracted my attention at the time more than the look of Mrs Stanford at the betrayer as she sat before her She did not say a word to her but her countenance told the feelings of her inmost soul and we could but think that had she spoken to her she would have said May the world deny thee a shelter earth a home the dust a grave the sun his light and Heaven her God The betrayer begged us to let her go I was somewhat disposed to comply with her request but I found many to oppose me in fact I was entirely alone My main reason for wishing to let her escape was that I was afraid that her life would be in danger I knew that if she was taken back to Buffalo or Canada she would fall into the hands of an excited people the most of whom had themselves been slaves And they being comparatively ignorant of the laws would be likely to take the law into their own hands However the woman was not allowed to escape but was put into the coach together with Stanford and his wife and after an hour and a half's drive we found ourselves in the city of Buffalo The excitement which the alarm had created in the morning had broken up the meetings of the colored people for that day and on our arrival in the city we were met by some forty or fifty colored persons The kidnappers had not been inactive for on our arrival in the city we learned that the man who had charge of the carriage and fugitives when we caught up with them returned to the city immediately after giving the slaves up to us and had informed Tate who had remained behind of what had occurred Tate immediately employed the sheriff and his posse to re take the slaves So on our arrival in Buffalo we found that the main battle had yet to be fought Stanford and his wife and child were soon provided with clothing and some refreshment while we were preparing ourselves with clubs pistols knives and other weapons of defence News soon come to us that the sheriff with his under officers together with some sixty or seventy men who were at work on the canal were on the road between Buffalo and Black Rock and that they intended to re take the slaves when we should attempt to take them to the ferry to convey them to Canada This news was anything but pleasant to us but we prepared for the worst We returned to the city about two o'clock in the afternoon and about four we started for Black Rock ferry which is about three miles below Buffalo We had in our company some fifty or more able bodied resolute men who were determined to stand by the slaves and who had resolved before they left the city that if the sheriff and his men took the slaves they should first pass over their dead bodies We started and when about a mile below the city the sheriff and his men came upon us and surrounded us The slaves were in a carriage and the horses were soon stopped and we found it advisable to take them out of the carriage and we did so The sheriff came forward and read something purporting to be a Riot Act and at the same time called upon all good citizens to aid him in keeping the peace This was a trick of his to get possession of the slaves His men rushed upon us with their clubs and stones and a general fight ensued Our company had surrounded the slaves and had succeeded in keeping the sheriff and his men off We fought and at the same time kept pushing on towards the ferry In the midst of the fight a little white man made his appearance among us and proved to be a valuable friend His name was Pepper and he proved himself a pepper to the sheriff and his posse that day He was a lawyer and as the officers would arrest any of our company he would step up and ask the officer if he had a warrant to take that man and as none of them had warrants and could not answer affirmatively he would say to the colored man He has no right to take you knock him down The command was no sooner given than the man would fall If the one who had been arrested was not able to knock him down some who were close by and who were armed with a club or other weapon would come to his assistance After it became generally known in our company that the little man was a lawyer he had a tremendous influence with them You could hear them cry out occasionally That's right knock him down the little man told you to do it and he is a lawyer he knows all about the law that's right hit him again he is a white man and he has done our color enough Such is but a poor representation of what was said by those who were engaged in the fight After a hard fought battle of nearly two hours we arrived at the ferry the slaves still in our possession On arriving at the ferry we found that some of the sheriff's gang had taken possession of the ferry boat Here another battle was to be fought before the slaves could reach Canada The boat was fastened at each end by a chain and in the scuffle for the ascendency one party took charge of one end of the boat while the other took the other end The blacks were commanding the ferryman to carry them over while the whites were commanding him not to While each party was contending for power the slaves were pushed on board and the boat shoved from the wharf Many of the blacks jumped on board of the boat while the whites jumped on shore And the swift current of the Niagara soon carried them off amid the shouts of the blacks and the oaths and imprecations of the whites We on shore swung our hats and gave three cheers just as a reinforcement came to the whites Seeing the odds entirely against us in numbers and having gained the great victory we gave up without resistance and suffered ourselves to be arrested by the sheriff's posse However we all remained on the shore until the ferry boat had landed on the Canada side As the boat landed Stanford leaped on shore and rolled over in the sand and even rubbed it into his hair I did not accompany the boat over but those who did informed us that Mrs Stanford as she stepped on the shore with her child in her arms exclaimed I thank God that I am again in Canada We returned to the city and some forty of our company were lodged in jail to await their trial the next morning And now I will return to the betrayer On our return to Buffalo she was given over to a committee of women who put her in a room and put a guard over her Tate who had been very active from the time that he heard that we had recaptured the carriage with the slaves was still in the city He was not with the slaves when we caught up with them at Hamburgh nor was he to be found in the fight He sent his hirelings while he remained at the hotel drinking champagne As soon as he found the slaves were out of his reach he then made an offer of fifty dollars to any person who would find the betrayer He pretended that he wished to save her from the indignation of the colored people But the fact is he had promised her that if she would accompany him to the south that he would put her in a situation where she would be a lady Poor woman She was foolish enough to believe him and now that the people had lost all sympathy for her on account of her traitorous act he still thought that by pretending to be her friend he could induce her to go to the south that he might sell her But those who had her in charge were determined that she should be punished for being engaged in this villanous transaction Several meetings were held to determine what should be done with her Some were in favor of hanging her others for burning her but a majority were for taking her to the Niagara river tying a fifty six pound weight to her and throwing her in There seemed to be no way in which she could be reached by the civil law She was kept in confinement three days being removed to different places each night So conflicting were the views of those who had her in charge that they could not decide upon what should be done with her However there seemed to be such a vast majority in favor of throwing her into the Niagara river that some of us who were opposed to taking life succeeded in having her given over to another committee who after reprimanding her let her go Tate in the mean time hearing that the colored people had resolved to take vengeance on him thought it best to leave the city On Monday at ten o'clock we were all carried before Justice Grosvenor and of the forty who had been committed the evening before twenty five were held to bail to answer to a higher court When the trials came on we were fined more or less from five to fifty dollars each During the fight no one was killed though there were many broken noses and black eyes one young man who was attached to a theatrical corps was so badly injured in the conflict that he died some three months after Thus ended one of the most fearful fights for human freedom that I ever witnessed The reader will observe that this conflict took place on the Sabbath and that those who were foremost in getting it up were officers of justice The plea of the sheriff and his posse was that we were breaking the Sabbath by assembling in such large numbers to protect a brother slave and his wife and child from being dragged back into slavery which is far worse than death itself From the Liberty Bell of THE AMERICAN SLAVE TRADE BY WILLIAM WELLS BROWN Of the many features which American slavery presents the most cruel is that of the slave trade A traffic in the bodies and souls of native born Americans is carried on in the slave holding states to an extent little dreamed of by the great mass of the people in the non slave holding states The precise number of slaves carried from the slave raising to the slave consuming states we have no means of knowing But it must be very great as forty thousand were sold and carried out of the State of Virginia in one single year This heart rending and cruel traffic is not confined to any particular class of persons No person forfeits his or her character or standing in society by being engaged in raising and selling slaves to supply the cotton sugar and rice plantations of the south Few persons who have visited the slave states have not on their return told of the gangs of slaves they had seen on their way to the southern market This trade presents some of the most revolting and atrocious scenes which can be imagined Slave prisons slave auctions handcuffs whips chains bloodhounds and other instruments of cruelty are part of the furniture which belongs to the American slave trade It is enough to make humanity bleed at every pore to see these implements of torture Known to God only is the amount of human agony and suffering which sends its cry from these slave prisons unheard or unheeded by man up to His ear mothers weeping for their children breaking the night silence with the shrieks of their breaking hearts We wish no human being to experience emotions of needless pain but we do wish that every man woman and child in New England could visit a southern slave prison and auction stand I shall never forget a scene which took place in the city of St Louis while I was in slavery A man and his wife both slaves were brought from the country to the city for sale They were taken to the rooms of AUSTIN SAVAGE auctioneers Several slave speculators who are always to be found at auctions where slaves are to be sold were present The man was first put up and sold to the highest bidder The wife was next ordered to ascend the platform I was present She slowly obeyed the order The auctioneer commenced and soon several hundred dollars were bid My eyes were intensely fixed on the face of the woman whose cheeks were wet with tears But a conversation between the slave and his new master attracted my attention I drew near them to listen The slave was begging his new master to purchase his wife Said he Master if you will only buy Fanny I know you will get the worth of your money She is a good cook a good washer and her last mistress liked her very much If you will only buy her how happy I shall be The new master replied that he did not want her but if she sold cheap he would purchase her I watched the countenance of the man while the different persons were bidding on his wife When his new master bid on his wife you could see the smile upon his countenance and the tears stop but as soon as another would bid you could see the countenance change and the tears start afresh From this change of countenance one could see the workings of the inmost soul But this suspense did not last long the wife was struck off to the highest bidder who proved not to be the owner of her husband As soon as they became aware that they were to be separated they both burst into tears and as she descended from the auction stand the husband walking up to her and taking her by the hand said Well Fanny we are to part forever on earth you have been a good wife to me I did all that I could to get my new master to buy you but he did not want you and all I have to say is I hope you will try to meet me in heaven I shall try to meet you there The wife made no reply but her sobs and cries told too well her own feelings I saw the countenances of a number of whites who were present and whose eyes were dim with tears at hearing the man bid his wife farewell Such are but common occurrences in the slave states At these auction stands bones muscles sinews blood and nerves of human beings are sold with as much indifference as a farmer in the north sells a horse or sheep And this great American nation is at the present time engaged in the slave trade I have before me now the Washington UNION the organ of the government in which I find an advertisement of several slaves to be sold for the benefit of the government They will in all human probability find homes among the rice swamps of Georgia or the canebrakes of Mississippi With every disposition on the part of those who are engaged in it to veil the truth certain facts have from time to time transpired sufficient to show if not the full amount of the evil at least that it is one of prodigious magnitude And what is more to be wondered at is the fact that the greatest slave market is to be found at the capital of the country The American slave trader marches by the capitol with his coffle gang the stars and stripes waving over their heads and the constitution of the United States in his pocket The Alexandria Gazette speaking of the slave trade at the capital says Here you may behold fathers and brothers leaving behind them the dearest objects of affection and moving slowly along in the mute agony of despair there the young mother sobbing over the infant whose innocent smile seems but to increase her misery From some you will hear the burst of bitter lamentation while from others the loud hysteric laugh breaks forth denoting still deeper agony Such is but a faint picture of the American slave trade Boston Massachusetts FLIGHT OF THE BONDMAN DEDICATED TO WILLIAM W BROWN And sung by the Hutchinsons BY ELIAS SMITH FROM the crack of the rifle and baying of hound Takes the poor panting bondman his flight His couch through the day is the cold damp ground But northward he runs through the night O God speed the night of the desolate slave Let his heart never yield to despair There is room 'mong our hills for the true and the brave Let his lungs breathe our free northern air O sweet to the storm driven sailor the light Streaming far o'er the dark swelling wave But sweeter by far 'mong the lights of the night Is the star of the north to the slave Cold and bleak are our mountains and chilling our winds But warm as the soft southern gales Be the hands and the hearts which the hunted one finds 'Mong our hills and our own winter vales Then list to the 'plaint of the heart broken thrall Ye blood hounds go back to your lair May a free northern soil soon give freedom to all Who shall breathe in its pure mountain air FREEDOM'S STAR Respectfully Dedicated to William Wells Brown as a testimony of regard for his uncompromising advocacy of the cause of his enslaved brothers and sisters by D B HARRIS As I strayed from my cot at the close of the day I turned my fond gaze to the sky I beheld all the stars as so sweetly they lay And but one fixed my heart or my eye Shine on northern star thou 'rt beautiful and bright To the slave on his journey afar For he speeds from his foes in the darkness of night Guided on by thy light freedom's star On thee he depends when he threads the dark woods Ere the bloodhounds have hunted him back Thou leadest him on over mountains and floods With thy beams shining full on his track Unwelcome to him is the bright orb of day As it glides o'er the earth and the sea He seeks then to hide like a wild beast of prey But with hope rests his heart upon thee May never a cloud overshadow thy face While the slave flies before his pursuer Gleam steadily on to the end of his race Till his body and soul are secure LAMENT OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE My child we must soon part to meet no more this side of the grave You have ever said that you would not die a slave that you would be a free man Now try to get your liberty W W BROWN'S NARRATIVE I've wandered out beneath the moonlit heaven Lost mother loved and dear To every beam a magic power seems given To bring thy spirit near For though the breeze of freedom fans my brow My soul still turns to thee oh where art thou Where art thou mother I am weary thinking A heritage of pain and woe Was thine beneath it art thou slowly sinking Or hast thou perished long ago And doth thy spirit 'mid the quivering leaves above me Hover dear mother to guard and love me I murmur at my lot in the white man's dwelling The mother there is found Or he may tell where spring buds first are swelling Above her lowly mound But thou lost mother every trace of thee In the vast sepulchre of Slavery Long years have fled since sad faint hearted I stood on Freedom's shore And knew dear mother from thee I was parted To meet thee never more And deemed the tyrant's chain with thee were better Than stranger hearts and limbs without a fetter Yet blessings on thy Roman mother spirit Could I forget it then The parting scene and struggle not to inherit A freeman's birth right once again O noble words O holy love which gave Thee strength to utter them a poor heart broken slave Be near me mother be thy spirit near me Wherever thou may'st be In hours like this bend near that I may hear thee And know that thou art free Summoned at length from bondage toil and pain To God's free world a world without a chain APPENDIX IN giving a history of my own sufferings in slavery as well as the sufferings of others with which I was acquainted or which came under my immediate observation I have spoken harshly of slaveholders in church and state Nor am I inclined to apologize for anything which I have said There are exceptions among slaveholders as well as among other sinners and the fact that a slaveholder feeds his slaves better clothes them better than another does not alter the case he is a slaveholder I do not ask the slaveholder to feed clothe or to treat his victim better as a slave I am not waging a warfare against the collateral evils or what are sometimes called the abuses of slavery I wage a war against slavery itself because it takes man down from the lofty position which God intended he should occupy and places him upon a level with the beasts of the field It decrees that the slave shall not worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience it denies him the word of God it makes him a chattel and sells him in the market to the highest bidder it decrees that he shall not protect the wife of his bosom it takes from him every right which God gave him Clothing and food are as nothing compared with liberty What care I for clothing or food while I am the slave of another You may take me and put cloth upon my back boots upon my feet a hat upon my head and cram a beef steak down my throat and all of this will not satisfy me as long as I know that you have the power to tear me from my dearest relatives All I ask of the slaveholder is to give the slave his liberty It is freedom I ask for the slave And that the American slave will eventually get his freedom no one can doubt You cannot keep the human mind forever locked up in darkness A ray of light a spark from freedom's altar the idea of inherent right each all will become fixed in the soul and that moment his limbs swell beyond the measure of his chains that moment he is free then it is that the slave dies to become a freeman then it is felt that one hour of virtuous liberty is worth an eternity of bondage then it is in the madness and fury of his blood that the excited soul exclaims From life without freedom oh who would not fly For one day of freedom oh who would not die The rising of the slaves in Southampton Virginia in has not been forgotten by the American people Nat Turner a slave for life a Baptist minister entertained the idea that he was another Moses whose duty it was to lead his people out of bondage His soul was fired with the love of liberty and he declared to his fellow slaves that the time had arrived and that They who would be free themselves must strike the blow He knew that it would be liberty or death with his little band of patriots numbering less than three hundred He commenced the struggle for liberty he knew his cause was just and he loved liberty more than he feared death He did not wish to take the lives of the whites he only demanded that himself and brethren might be free The slaveholders found that men whose souls were burning for liberty however small their numbers could not be put down at their pleasure that something more than water was wanted to extinguish the flame They trembled at the idea of meeting men in open combat whose backs they had lacerated whose wives and daughters they had torn from their bosoms whose hearts were bleeding from the wounds inflicted by them They appealed to the United States government for assistance A company of United States troops was sent into Virginia to put down men whose only offence was that they wanted to be free Yes northern men men born and brought up in the free states at the demand of slavery marched to its rescue They succeeded in reducing the poor slave again to his chains but they did not succeed in crushing his spirit Not the combined powers of the American Union not the slaveholders with all their northern allies can extinguish that burning desire of freedom in the slave's soul Northern men may stand by as the body guard of slaveholders They may succeed for the time being in keeping the slave in his chains but unless the slaveholders liberate their victims and that too speedily some modern Hannibal will make his appearance in the southern states who will trouble the slaveholders as the noble Carthaginian did the Romans Abolitionists deprecate the shedding of blood they have warned the slaveholders again and again Yet they will not give heed but still persist in robbing the slave of liberty But for the fear of northern bayonets pledged for the master's protection the slaves would long since have wrung a peaceful emancipation from the fears of their oppressors or sealed their own redemption in blood To the shame of the northern people the slaveholders confess that to them they are indebted for a permanent safe guard against insurrection that a million of their slaves stand ready to strike for liberty at the first tap of the drum and but for the aid of the north they would be too weak to keep them in their chains I ask in the language of the slave's poet What shall ye guard your neighbor still While woman shrieks beneath his rod And while he tramples down at will The image of a common God Shall watch and ward be 'round him set Of northern nerve and bayonet The countenance of the people at the north has quieted the the fears of the slaveholders especially the countenance which they receive from northern churches But for the countenance of the northern church the southern conscience would have long since awakened to its guilt and the impious sight of a church made up of slaveholders and called the church of Christ been scouted from the world So says a distinguished writer Slaveholders hide themselves behind the church A more praying preaching psalm singing people cannot be found than the slaveholders at the south The religion of the south is referred to every day to prove that slaveholders are good pious men But with all their pretensions and all the aid which they get from the northern church they cannot succeed in deceiving the Christian portion of the world Their child robbing man stealing woman whipping chain forging marriage destroying slave manufacturing man slaying religion will not be received as genuine and the people of the free states cannot expect to live in union with slaveholders without becoming contaminated with slavery They are looked upon as one people they are one people the people in the free and slave states form the American Union Slavery is a national institution The nation licenses men to traffic in the bodies and souls of men it supplies them with public buildings at the capital of the country to keep their victims in For a paltry sum it gives the auctioneer a license to sell American men women and children upon the auction stand The American slave trader with the constitution in his hat and his license in his pocket marches his gang of chained men and women under the very eaves of the nation's capitol And this too in a country professing to be the freest nation in the world They profess to be democrats republicans and to believe in the natural equality of men that they are all created with certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness They call themselves a Christian nation they rob three millions of their countrymen of their liberties and then talk of their piety their democracy and their love of liberty and in the language of Shakespeare say And thus I clothe my naked villany And seem a saint when most I play the devil The people of the United States with all their high professions are forging chains for unborn millions in their wars for slavery With all their democracy there is not a foot of land over which the stars and stripes fly upon which the American slave can stand and claim protection Wherever the United States constitution has jurisdiction and the American flag is seen flying they point out the slave as a chattel a thing a piece of property But I thank God there is one spot in America upon which the slave can stand and be a man No matter whether the claimant be a United States president or a doctor of divinity no matter with what solemnities some American court may have pronounced him a slave the moment he makes his escape from under the stars and stripes and sets foot upon the soil of CANADA the altar and the god sink together in the dust his soul walks abroad in her own majesty his body swells beyond the measure of his chains that burst from around him and he stands redeemed regenerated and disenthralled by the irresistible genius of universal emancipation But slavery must and will be banished from the United States soil Let tyrants scorn while tyrants dare The shrieks and writhings of despair The end will come it will not wait Bonds yokes and scourges have their date Slavery itself must pass away And be a tale of yesterday But I will now stop and let the slaveholders speak for themselves I shall here present some evidences of the treatment which slaves receive from their masters after which I will present a few of the slave laws And it has been said and I believe truly that no people were ever found to be better than their laws And as an American slave as one who is identified with the slaves of the south by the scars which I carry on my back as one identified with them by the tenderest ties of nature as one whose highest aspirations are to serve the cause of truth and freedom I beg of the reader not to lay this book down until he or she has read every it contains I ask it not for my own sake but for the sake of three millions who cannot speak for

Tanner residing in the neighborhood and was sent home in this condition After coming home her constant request until her death was for bread by which it would seem that she had been starved as well as unmercifully whipped The jury returned a verdict that she came to her death by the blows inflicted by some persons unknown whilst she was in the employ of Mr Tanner Mrs Tanner has been tried and acquitted A correspondent of the N Y Herald writes from St Louis Oct I yesterday visited the cell of Cornelia the slave charged with being the accomplice of Mrs Ann Tanner recently acquitted in the

are mostly abridged selections from the statutes of the slave states and of the United States They give but a faint view of the cruel oppression to which the slaves are subject but a strong one enough it is thought to fill every honest heart with a deep abhorrence of the atrocious system Most of the important provisions here cited though placed under the name of only one state prevail in nearly all the states with slight variations in language and some diversity in the penalties The extracts have been made in part from Stroud's Sketch of the Slave Laws but chiefly from authorized editions of the statute books referred to found in the Philadelphia Law Library As the compiler has not had access to many of the later enactments of the several states nearly all he has cited are acts of an earlier date than that of the present anti slavery movement so that their severity cannot be ascribed to its influence The cardinal principle of slavery that the slave is not to be ranked among sentient beings but among things is an article of property a chattel personal obtains as undoubted law in all the slave states Stroud's Sketch p The dominion of the master is as unlimited as is that which is tolerated by the laws of any civilized country in relation to brute animals to quadrupeds to use the words of the civil law Ib Slaves cannot even contract matrimony Ib LOUISIANA A slave is one who is

should give the mayor satisfactory evidence of his freedom and enter into bond with two freehold sureties in the sum of five hundred dollars for his good conduct to be renewed each year for three years or failing to do so must leave the city or be committed to the work house for not more than one year and if he still refuse to go may be again committed for the same period and so on Ib Colored persons residing in the city who cannot prove their title to freedom shall be imprisoned as absconding slaves Ib By the operation of this provision twelve slave holding states whose white population only equals that of New York and Ohio send to congress senators and representatives while these two states only send senators and representatives Thus it may be seen that a man may be doomed to

TO THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM AND EMANCIPATION IN EUROPE Boston July In consequence of the departure for England of their esteemed friend and faithful co labourer in the cause of the American slave William W Brown the Board of Managers of the Massachusetts Anti Slavery Society would commend him to the confidence respect esteem and hospitality of the friends of emancipation wherever he may travel Because he is a fugitive slave from the American house of bondage and on the soil which gave him birth can find no spot on which he can stand in safety from his pursuers protected by law Because he is a man and not a chattel and while as the latter he may at any time be sold at public vendue under the American star spangled banner we rejoice to know that he will be recognised and protected as the former under the flag of England Because for several years past he has nobly consecrated his time and talents at great personal hazard and under the most adverse circumstances to the uncompromising advocacy of the cause of his enslaved countrymen Because he visits England for the purpose of increasing consolidating and directing British humanity and piety against that horrible system of slavery in America by which three millions of human beings by creation the children of God are ranked with four footed beasts and treated as marketable commodities Because he has long been in their employment as a lecturing agent in Massachusetts and has laboured to great acceptance and with great success and from the acquaintance thus formed they are enabled to certify that he has invariably conducted himself with great circumspection and won for himself the sympathy respect and friendship of a very large circle of acquaintance In behalf of the Board of Managers WM LLOYD GARRISON ROBERT F WALLCUT SAMUEL MAY JUN Boston July My dear friend To day you leave the land of your nativity in which you have been reared and treated as a slave a chattel personal a marketable commodity though it claims to be a republican and Christian land the freest of the free the most pious of the pious for the shores of Europe on touching which your shackles will instantly fall your limbs expand your spirit exult in absolute personal freedom as a man and nothing less than a man Since your escape from bondage a few years since you have nobly devoted yourself to the cause of the three millions of our countrymen who are yet clanking their chains in hopeless bondage pleading their cause eloquently and effectively by day and by night in season and out of season before the people of the Free States falsely so called of America at much personal hazard of being seized and hurried back to slavery Not to forsake that cause but still more powerfully to aid it by enlisting the sympathies and consolidating the feelings and opinions of the friends of freedom and universal emancipation in the old world in its favour and against the atrocious slave system do you bid farewell to the land of whips and chains to day God the God of the oppressed the poor the needy the defenceless be with you to guide strengthen aid and bless you abundantly Three millions of slaves are your constituents and you are their legitimate and faithful representative With a mother sister and three brothers yet pining in hopeless servitude with the marks of the slavedriver's lash upon your body you cannot but remember them that are in bonds as bound with them Speak in trumpet tones to Europe and call upon the friends of liberty equality and fraternity there to cry Shame upon recreant and apostate America which flourishes the Declaration of Independence in one hand and the whip of the negro overseer in the other Challenge all that is free all that is humane all that is pious across the Atlantic to raise a united testimony against American slaveholders and their abettors as the enemies of God and the human race So shall that cry and that testimony cause the knees of the oppressor to smite together the Bastile of slavery to tremble to its foundation and the hearts of the American abolitionists to be filled with joy and inspired afresh Tell Europe that our watchword is Immediate unconditional emancipation for the slave and the motto we have placed on our anti slavery banner is No Union with Slaveholders religiously or politically You have secured the respect confidence and esteem of

of the above book and have read it Wells Brown the Christian philanthropist who fed clothed and otherwise assisted this panting fugitive and to whom this little book is dedicated is truly a happy man This act of humanity though among perhaps the hundreds in his life of a similar character and in defiance of the law solemnly made will we doubt not redound even to his everlasting happiness The thoughts and feelings which naturally arise from the perusal of this little narrative make all questions of party and sectarian rivalry appear utterly insignificant We would that a copy of this book could be placed in every school library in Massachusetts We hope and believe that it will be widely circulated Boston Whig NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF WM W BROWN A FUGITIVE SLAVE WRITTEN BY HIMSELF This is the title of a book that has just made its appearance and a copy of which is upon our table The author is well known in this community as an able advocate of his enslaved countrymen and his narrative will we doubt not get an extensive circulation We have read the narrative and consider it a fair history of the author's life and of slavery at the South It is an interesting narrative and should be read by every person in the country We commend it to the public and venture the assertion that no one who takes it up and reads a will lay it down until he has finished it New Bedford Bulletin WILLIAM W BROWN ON SLAVERY This talented American slave has delivered three lectures in this town to crowded and very attentive audiences We did not attend the lectures but a friend informed us that they evinced much ability and though rather spicy for the tender ears of those who despise a man on account of the color of his skin they were not as much so as might to have been expected from one who has himself felt the scourge of involuntary servitude not as much so as might have been expected from one who is hunted as a fugitive slave from one end of this notable land of the free to the other We have read Mr Brown's Narrative with great interest and found it a thrilling tale We would recommend it to all who feel any interest in the cause of the American slaves it will quicken their devotion to the cause We would advise the indifferent to read it it will touch them with sympathy for the oppressed bondman Lawrence Courier 
Uncle-TomJones,EXPERIENCE AND PERSONAL NARRATIVE OF UNCLE TOM JONES WHO WAS FOR FORTY YEARS A SLAVE ALSO THE SURPRISING ADVENTURES OF WILD TOM OF THE ISLAND RETREAT A FUGITIVE NEGRO FROM SOUTH CAROLINA BOSTON PUBLISHED BY H B SKINNER No FRIEND STREET SURPRISING ADVENTURES OF UNCLE TOM JONES FOR FORTY YEARS A SLAVE I was born a slave My recollections of early life are associated with poverty suffering and shame I was made to feel in my boyhood's first experience that I was inferior and degraded and that I must pass through life in a dependent and suffering condition The experience of forty three years which were passed by me in slavery was one of dark fears and darker realities John Hawes was my first master He lived in Hanover County N C between the Black and South Rivers and was the owner of a large plantation called Hawes' Plantation He had over fifty slaves I remained with my parents nine years They were both slaves owned by John Hawes They had six children Richard Alexander Charles Sarah myself and John I remember well that dear old cabin with its clay floor and mud chimney in which for nine years I enjoyed the presence and love of my wretched parents Father and mother tried to make it a happy place for their dear children Theyworked late into the night many and many a time to get a little simple furniture for their home and the home of their children and they spent many hours of willing toil to stop up the chinks between the logs of their poor hut that they and their children might be protected from the storm and the cold I can testify from my own painful experience to the deep and fond affection which the slave cherishes in his heart for his home and its dear ones We have no other tie to link us to the human family but our fervent love for those who are with us and of us in relations of sympathy and devotedness in wrongs and wretchedness My dear parents were conscious of the desperate and incurable woe of their position and destiny and the lot of inevitable suffering in store for their beloved children They talked about our coming misery and they lifted up their voices and wept aloud as they spoke of our being torn from them and sold off to the dreaded slave trader perhaps never to see them or hear from them a word of fond love I am a father and have had the same feelings of unspeakable anguish as I have looked upon my precious babes and have thought of the ignorance degradation and woe which they must endure as slaves The great God who knoweth all the secrets of the earth and He only knows the bitter sorrow I now feel when I think of my four dear children who are slaves torn from me and consigned to hopeless servitude by the iron hand of ruthless wrong I love those children with all a father's fondness Mr Hawes was a very severe and cruel master He kept no overseer and supplied his slaves with but a very scanty allowance of food and clothing During the planting and harvest season we had to work early and late The men and women were called at three o'clock in the morning and were worked on the plantation until it was dark at night After that they must prepare their food for supper and for the breakfast of the next day and to attend to other duties of their own dear homes In the month of November and through the winter season the men and women worked in the fields clearing up the new land chopping and burning bushes burning tar kilns and digging ditches They worked together poorly clad and suffering from the bitter cold and wet of those winter months Women wives and mothers daughters and sisters on that plantation were compelled to toil on cold stormy days in the open field while the piercing wind and driving storm benumed their limbs and almost froze the tears that came forth out of their cold and desolate hearts Little boys and girls too worked and cried toting brush to the fires husking the corn watching the stock and running out errands for master and mistress for their three sons Enoch Edward and John and constantly receiving from them scoldings and beatings as their reward Thus passed nine years of my life years of suffering the shuddering memory of which is deeply fixed in my heart These nine years of wretchedness passed and a change came for me My master sold me to Mr Jones of Washington N C distant forty five miles from Hawes' plantation Mr Jones sent his slave driver a colored man named Abraham to conduct me to my new home in Washington I was at home with my mother when he came He looked in at the door and called to me Tom you must go with me His looks were ugly and his voice was savage I was very much afraid and began to cry holding on to my mother's clothes and begging her to protect me and not let the man take me away Mother wept bitterly and in the midst of her loud sobbings cried out in broken words I can't save you Tommy master has sold you you must go She threw her arms around me and while the hot tears fell on my face she strained me to her heart There she held me sobbing and mourning till the brutal Abraham came in snatched me away hurried me out of the house where I was born my only home and tore me away from the dear mother who loved me as no other friend could do She followed him imploring a moment's delay and weeping aloud to the road where he turned around and striking at her with his heavy cowhide fiercely ordered her to stop bawling and go back into the house Thus was I snatched from my loving parents and from the true affection of the dear ones of home For thirteen weary years did my heart turn in its yearnings to that precious home And then at the age of twenty two I was permitted to revisit my early home I found it all desolate the family all broken up father was sold and gone Richard Alexander Charles Sarah and John were sold and gone Mother prematurely old heart broken utterly desolate weak and dying alone remained I saw her and wept once more on her bosom I went back to my chains with a deeper woe in my heart than I had ever felt before There was but one thought of joy in my wretched conscionsness and that was that my kind and precious mother would soon be at rest in the grave And then too I remember I mused with deep earnestness on death as the only friend the poor slave had And I wished that I too might lie down by my mother's side and die with her in her loving embrace My journey to Washington with the heartless Abraham was a very sad one We walked all the way He strode along in stern gloom and silence too fast for my young feet to keep pace and I began to feel that I must stop and rest It was bitter cold too and I was poorly clad to bear the keen air of a January day My limbs were weary with travel and stiff with cold I could not go on at the rate I had done and so I turned to my guide and begged him to take me into some hut and let me rest and get warm He cursed me and told me to keep silence and come along or he would warm me with the cowhide Oh I thought how cruel and hopeless my lot Would that I could fall down here and die And I did fall down We had just passed through a soft wet place and it seemed then to me that I was frozen And I fell down on my dark cold way unable to proceed I was then carried into a slave's cabin and allowed to warm and rest It was nearly midnight when I arrived with my conductor at my place of exile and suffering And certainly no heart could be more entirely wretched than I was when I threw my weary aching body on my cold hard bed The next morning I was called into the presence of Mr Jones my new master and my work was assigned to me I was to take care of the horse sweep the rooms and to bring wood from the wharf on my head for the fires at the house and store with many other duties From the first dawn of day till ten and eleven and sometimes twelve at night I could hardly find one moment's time for rest And Oh how the memory of that year of constant toil and weariness is imprinted on my heart an impression of appalling sorrow My dreams are still haunted with the agony of that year I had just been torn from my home my yearning heart was deprived of the sweet sympathy of those to whose memory I then clung and to whom my heart still turns with irrepressible and unutterable longings I was torn from them and put into a circle of cold selfish and cruel hearts and made to perform labors too great for my young strength And yet I lived through that year just as the slave lives on through weary years of suffering on which no ray or light shines save that which hope of a better happier future gives even to the desolate bondman but I lived through it with all its darkness and sorrow That year I received my first whipping I had failed one day to finish my allotted task It seemed to me that I had done my best but somehow that day thoughts of home came so fresh and tender into my mind and along with these thoughts a sense of my utter hopeless desolation came in and took such a strong hold of my heart that I sank down a helpless heart broken child My tasks for that day were neglected The next morning my master made me strip off my shirt and then whipped me with the cowhide till the blood ran trickling down upon the floor My master was very profane and with dreadful oaths he assured me that there was only one way for me to avoid a repetition of this terrible discipline and that was to do my tasks every day sick or well But this year went by and my duties were changed and my lot was made a little easier The cook Fanny died and I was put into her place I still had to get wood and keep the fires in the house and after the work of cooking setting the table clearing away and washing the dishes there was always something to be done for my mistress I got but little time to rest but I got enough to eat which I had not done the year before I was by the comfortable fire a good part of the cold winter weather instead of being exposed to the cold and wet without warm clothing as I had been the year before and my labor was not so hard this year as it had been the last My mistress complained of me at length that I was not so obedient as I ought to be and so I was taken from the house into the store My business there was to open and sweep out the store in the morning and get all the things ready for the accommodation of customers who might come in during the day Then I had to bring out and deliver all heavy articles that might be called for such as salt large quantities of which were sold in the store ship stores grain etc etc I had also to hold myself ready to run on any errand my master or his clerk David Cogdell might wish to send me on While Cogdell remained in the store I enjoyed a gleam of happiness He was very kind to me never giving me a cross word or a sour look always ready to show me how to do anything which I did not understand and to perform little acts of kindness to me But his kindness and generosity to the poor slaves was very offensive to my master and to other slave holders and so at length Mr Jones turned him off though he was compelled to acknowledge at the same time that he was the most trustworthy and valuable assistant he had ever had in his store After my master dismissed Mr C he tried to get along with me alone in the store He kept the books and waited upon the most genteel of his customers leaving me to do the rest of the work This went on six months when he declared that he could not bear this confinement any longer and so he got a white boy to come and enter as clerk to stay till he was of age James Dixon was a poor boy about my own age and when he came into the store could hardly read or write He was accordingly engaged a part of each day with his books and writing I saw him studying and asked him to let me see his book When he felt in a good humor James was very kind and oblging The great trouble with him was that his fits of ill humor were much more frequent than his times of good feeling It happened however that he was on good terms with himself when I asked him to show me his book and so he let me take it and look at it and he answered very kindly many questions which I asked him about books and schools and learning He told me that he was trying to get learning enough to fit him to do a good business for himself after he should get through with Mr Jones He told me that a man who had learning would always find friends and get along very well in the world without having to work hard while those who had no learning would nave no friends and be compelled to work very hard for a poor living all their days This was all new to me and furnished me topics for wondering thought for days afterwards The result of my meditations was that an intense burning desire to learn to read and write took possession of my mind occupying me wholly in waking hours and stirring up earnest thoughts in my soul even when I slept The question which then took hold of my whole consciousness was how can I get a book to begin James told me that a spelling book was the first one necessary in getting learning So I contrived how I might obtain a spelling book At length after much study I hit upon this plan I cleaned the boots of Mr David Smith Jr who carried on the printing business in Wilmington and edited the Cape Fear Recorder He had always appeared to me to be a very kind man I thought I would get him to aid me in procuring a spelling book So I went one morning with a beating heart into his office and asked him to sell me a spelling book He looked at me in silence and with close attention for some time and asked me what I wanted it for I told him I wanted to learn to read He shook his head and replied No Thomas it would not answer for me to sell you a book to learn out of you will only get yourself into trouble if you attempt it and I advise you to get that foolish notion out of your head as quickly as you can David's brother Peter Smith kept a book and stationary store under the printing office and I next applied to him for a book determined to persevere till I obtained this coveted treasure He asked me the same question that his brother David had done and with the same searching suspicious look By my previous repulse I had discovered that I could not get a spelling book if I told what I wanted to do with it and so I told a lie in order to get it I answered that I wanted it for a white boy naming one that lived at my master's and that he had given me the money to get it with and had asked me to call at the store and buy it The book was then handed out to me the money taken in return and I left feeling very rich with my long desired treasure I got out of the store and looking round to see that no one observed me I hid my book in my bosom and hurried on to my work consicous that a new era in my life was opening upon me through the possession of this book That consciousness at once awakened new thoughts purposes and hopes a new life and aot in my experience My mind was excited The words spoken by James Dixon of the great advantages of learning made me intensely anxious to learn I was a slave and I knew that the whole community was in league to keep the poor slave in ignorance and chains Yet I longed to be free and to be able to move the minds of other men by my thoughts It seemed to me now that if I could learn to read and write this learning might nay I really thought it would point out to me the way to freedom influence and real secure happiness So I hurried on to my master's store and watching my opportunity to do it safe from curious eyes I hid my book with the utmost care under some liquor barrels in the smokehouse The first opportunity I improved to examine it I looked it over with the most intense eagerness turned over its leaves and tried to discover what the new and strange chracters which I saw in its s might mean But I found it a vain endeavor I could understand a picture and from it make out a story of immediate interest to my mind But I could not associate any thought or fact with these crooked letters with which my primmer was filled So the next day I sought a favorable moment and asked James to tell me where a scholar must begin in order to learn to read and how He laughed at my Ignorance and taking his spelling book showed me the alphabet in large and small letters on the same I asked him the name of the first letter pointing it out he told me A so of the next and so on through the alphabet I managed to remember A and B and I studied and looked out the same letters in many other parts of the book And so I fixed in a tenacious memory the names of the two first letters of the alphabet But I found I could not get on without help and so I applied to James again to show me the letters and tell me their names This time he suspected me of trying to learn to read myself and he plied me with questions till he ascertained that I was in good earnest entering upon an effort to get knowledge At this discovery he manifested a good deal of indignation He told me in scorn that it was not for such as me to try to improve that I was a slave and that it was not proper for me to learn to read He threatened to tell my master and at length by his hard language my anger was fully aroused and I answered taunt with taunt He called me a poor miserable nigger and I called him a poor ignorant servant boy While we were engaged in loud and angry words of mutual defiance and scorn my master came into the store Mr Jones had never given me a whipping since the time I have already described during my first year of toil want and suffering in his service But he had now caught me in the unpardonable offence of giving saucy language to a white boy and one too who was in his employ Without stopping to make any inquiries he took down the cow hide and gave me a severe whipping He told me never to talk back to a white man on pain of flogging I suppose this law or custom is universal at the south And I suppose it is thought necessary to enforce ths habit of obsequious submission on the parts of the colored people to the whites in order to maintain their supremacy over the poor outraged slaves I will mention in this connection as illustrative of this cruel custom an incident which I saw just before I ran away from my chains A little colored boy was carrying along through Wilmington a basket of food His name was Ben and he belonged to Mrs Runkin a widow lady A little mischievous white boy just about Ben's age and size met him and purposely overturned the little fellow's basket and scattered his load in the mud Ben in return for this wanton act called him some hard name when the white boy clinched him to throw him down with the scattered fragments upon his basket in the mud Ben resisted and threw down the white boy proving to be the stronger of the two Tom Myers a young lawyer of Wilmington saw the contest and immediately rushing out seized little Ben and dragged him into the store opposite the place of battle He sent out to a saddler's shop procured a cow hide and gave the little fellow a tremendous flogging for the daring crime of resisting a white boy who had wantonly invaded his rights Is it any wonder that the spirit of self respect of the poor ignorant slave is broken down by such treatment of unsparing and persevering cruelty I was now repulsed by James so that I could hope for no assistance from him in learning to read But I could not go on alone I must get some one to aid me in starting or give up the effort to learn This I could not bear to do I thought of a little boy Hiram Bricket ten years old or about that age who came along by the store one day on his way home from school while my master was gone home to dinner and James was in the front part of the store I beckoned to Hiram to come round to the back door and with him I made a bargain to meet me each day at noon when I was allowed a little while to get my dinner and to give me instruction in reading I was to give him six cents a week I met him the next day at his father's stable the place agreed upon for our daily meeting and going into one of the stables the noble little fellow gave me a thorough lesson in the alphabet I learned it nearly all at that time with what study I could give it by stealth during the day and night And then again I felt lifted up and happy I was permitted to enjoy these advantages however but a short time A black boy belonging to Hiram's father one day discovered our meeting and what we were doing He told his master of it and Hiram was at once forbidden this employment I had then got along so that I was reading and spelling in words of two syllables After I was deprived of my kind little teacher I plodded on the best way I could by myself and in this way I got into words of five syllables I got some little time to study by daylight in the morning before any of my master's family had risen I got a moment's opportunity also at noon and sometimes at night During the day I was in the back store a good deal and whenever I thought I could have a few minutes to myself I would take my book and try to learn a little in reading and spelling If I heard James or master Jones or any customer coming in I would drop my book among the barrels and pretended to be very busy shovelling the salt or doing some other work Several times I came very near being detected My master suspected something because I was so still in the back room and a number of times he came very slyly to see what I was about But at such times I was always so fortunate as to hear his tread or to see his shadow on the wall in time to hide away my book When I had got along to words of five syllables I went to see a free colored friend Ned Cowen whom I knew I could trust and told him that I was trying to learn to read and asked him to help me a little He told me I had got along far enough to get another book in which I could learn to write the letters as well as to read He told me where and how to procure this book I followed his directions and obtained another spelling book at Worcester's store in Wilmington Jacob showed me a little about writing He set me a copy first of straight marks I now got me a box which I could hide under my bed some ink pens and a bit of candle So when I went to bed I pulled my box out from under my cot turned it up on end and began my first attempt at writing I worked away till my candle was burned out and then lay down to sleep Jacob next set me a copy which he called pot hooks then the letters of the alphabet These letters were also in my new spelling book and according to Jacob's directions I set them before me for a copy and wrote on these exercises till I could form all the letters and call them by name One evening I wrote out my name in large letters THOMAS JONES This I carried to Jacob in a great excitement of happiness and he warmly commended me for my perseverance and dilligence About this time I was at the store early one morning and thinking I was safe from all danger for a few minutes had seated myself in the back store on one of the barrels to study in my precious spelling book While I was absorbed in this happy enterprise my master came in much earlier than usual and I did not hear him He came directly into the back store I saw his shadow on the wall just in time to throw my book over in among the barrels before he could see what it was although he saw that I had thrown something quickly away His suspicion was aroused He said that I had been stealing something out of the store and he fiercely ordered me to get what I threw away just as he was coming in at the door Without a moment's hesitation I determined to save my precious book and my future opportunities to learn out of it I knew if my book was discovered that all was lost and I felt prepared for any hazard or suffering rather than give up my book and my hopes of improvement So I replied at once to his question that I had not thrown anything away that I had not stolen anything from the store that I did not have anything in my hands which I could throw away when he came in My master declared in high passion that I was lying and ordered me to begin and roll away the barrels This I did but managed to keep the book slipping along so that he could not see it as he stood in the door way He charged me again with stealing and throwing something away and I again denied the charge In a great rage he then got down his long heavy cow hide and ordered me to strip off my jacket and shirt saying with an oath I will make you tell me what it was you had when I came in I stripped myself and came forward according to his directions the same time denying his charge with great earnestness of tone and look and manner He cut me on my naked back perhaps thirty times with great severity making the blood flow freely He then stopped and asked me what I had thrown away as he came in I answered again that I had thrown nothing away He swore terribly said he was certain I was lying and declared that he would kill me if I did not tell him the truth He whipped me the second time with greater severity and at greater length than before He then repeated his question and I answered again as before I was determined to die if I could possibly bear the pain rather than give up my dear book He whipped me the third time with the same result as before and then seizing hold of my shoulders turned me round as though he would inflict on my quivering flesh still another scourging but he saw the deep gashes he had already made and the blood already flowing under his cruel infliction and his stern purpose failed him He said Why Tom I din't think I had cut you so bad and saying that he stopped and told me to put on my shirt again I did as he bade me although my coarse shirt touching my raw back put me to a cruel pain He then went out and I got my book and hid it safely away before he came in again When I went to the house my wounds had dried and I was in an agony of pain My mistress told the servant girl Rachel to help me off with my shirt and to wash my wounds for me and to put on to them some sweet oil The shirt was dried to my back so that it could not be got off without tearing off some of the skin with it The pain upon doing this was greater even than I had endured from my cruel whipping After Rachel had got my shirt off my mistress asked me what I had done for which my master had whipped me so severely I told her he had accused me of stealing when I had not and then had whipped me to make me own it While Rachel was putting on the sweet oil my master came in and I could hear mistress scolding him for giving me such an inhuman beating when I had done nothing He said in reply that Tom was an obstinate liar and that was the reason why he had whipped me But I got well of my mangled back and my book was as still left This was my best my constant friend With great eagerness I snatched every moment I could get morning noon and night for study I had begun to read and Oh how I loved to study and to dwell on the thoughts which I gained from my reading About this time I read a piece in my book about God It said that God who sees and knows all our thoughts loves the good and makes them happy while he is angry with the bad and will punish them for all their sins This made me feel very unhapdy because I was sure that I was not good in the sight of God I thought about this and couldn't get it out of my mind a single hour So I went to James Galley a colored man who exhorted the slaves sometimes on Sunday and told him my trouble asking what shall I do He told me about Jesus and told me I must pray the Lord to forgive me and help me to be good and happy So I went home and went down cellar and prayed but I found no relief no comfort for my unhappy mind I felt so bad that I could not even study my book My master saw that I looked very unhappy and he asked me what ailed me I did not dare now to tell a lie for I wanted to be good that I might be happy So I told master just how it was with me and then he swore terribly at me and said he would whip me if I did not give over praying He said there was no heaven and no hell and that Christians were all hypocrites and that there was nothing after this life and that he would not permit me to go moping round praying and going to the meetings I told him I could not help praying and then he cursed me in a great passion and declared that he would whip me if he knew of my going on any more in that foolish way The next night I was to a meeting which was led by Jack Cammon a free colored man and a class leader in the Methodist Church I was so much overcome by my feelings that I staid very late They prayed for me but I did not yet find any relief I was still very unhappy The next morning my master came in and asked me if I went the night before to the meeting I told him the truth He said didn't I tell you I would whip you if you went nigh these meetings and didn't I tell you to stop this foolish praying I told him he did and if he would why he might whip me but still I could not stop praying because I wanted to be good that I might be happy and go to heaven This reply made my master very angry With many bitter oaths he said he had promised me a whipping and now he should be as good as his word And so he was He whipped me and then forbade with bitter threatenings my praying any more and especially my going again to meeting This was Friday morning I continued to pray for comfort and peace The next Sunday I went to meeting The minister preached a sermon on being born again from the words of Jesus to Nicodemus All this only deepened my trouble of mind I returned home very unhappy Collins a free man of color was at the meeting and told my master that I was there So on Monday morning my master whipped me again and once more forbade my going to meetings and praying The next Sunday there was a class meeting led by Binney Pennison a colored free man I asked my master towards night if I might go out I told him I did not feel well I wanted to go to the class meeting Without asking me where I was going he said I might go I went to the class I staid very late and was so overcome by my feelings that I could not go home that night So they carried me to Joseph Jones's cabin a slave of Mr Jones Joseph talked and prayed with me nearly all night In the morning I went home as soon as it was light and for fear of master I asked Nancy one of the slaves to go up into mistress's room and get the store key for me that I might go and open the store My master told her to go back and tell me to come up I obeyed with many fears My master asked me where I had been the night before I told him the whole truth He cursed me again and said he should whip me for my obstinate disobedience and he declared that he would kill me if I did not promise to obey him He refused to listen to my mistress who was a professor and who tried to intercede for me And just as soon as he had finished threatening me with what he would do he ordered me to take the key and go and open the store When he came into the store that morning two of his neighbors Julius Dumbiven and MacCauslin came in too He called me up and asked me again where I staid last night I told him with his boy Joseph He said he knew that was a lie and he immediately sent off for Joseph to confirm his suspicions He ordered me to strip off my clothes and as I did so he took down the cow hide heavy and stiff with blood which he had before drawn from my body with that cruel weapon and which was congealed upon it Dumbiven professed to be a Christian and he now came forward and earnestly interceded for me but to no purpose and then he left McCauslin asked my master if he did not know that a slave was worth more money after he became pious than he was before And why then he said should you forbid Tom going to meetings and praying He replied that religion was all a damned mockery and he was not going to have any of his slaves praying and whining round about their souls McCauslin then left Joseph came and told the same story about the night before that I had done and then began to beg master not to whip me He cursed him and drove him off He then whipped me with great severity inflicting terrible pain at every blow upon my quivering body which was still very tender from recent lacerations My suffering was so great that it seemed to me that I should die He paused at length and asked me would I mind him and stop praying I told him I could not promise him not to pray any more for I felt that I must and should pray as long as I lived Well then Tom he said I swear that I will whip you to death I told him I could not help myself if he was determined to kill me but that I must pray while I lived He then began to whip me the second time but soon stopped threw down the bloody cow hide and told me to go wash myself in the river just back of the store and then dress myself and if I was determined to be a fool why I must be one My mistress now interceded earnestly for me with my cruel master The next Sabbath was love feast and I felt very anxious to join in that feast This I could not do without a paper from my master and so I asked mistress to help me She advised me to be patient and said she would help me all she could Master refused to give any paper and so I could not join the loving feast the next day On the next Friday evening I went to the prayer meeting Jack Cammon was there and opened the meeting with prayer Then Binney Pennison gave out the sweet hymn which begins in these words Come ye sinners poor and needy Weak and wounded sick and sore I felt that it all applied most sweetly to my condition and I said in my heart I will come now to Jesus and trust in him So when those who felt anxious were requested to come forward and kneel within the altar for prayer I came and knelt down While Jacob Cammon was praying for me and for those who knelt by my side my burden of sorrow which had so long weighed me down was removed I felt the glory of God's love warming my heart and making me very happy I shouted aloud for joy and tried to tell all my poor slave brothers and sisters who were in the house what a dear Saviour I had found and how happy I felt in his precious love Binney Pennison asked me if I could forgive my master I told him I could and did and that I could pray God to forgive him too and make him a good man He asked me if I could tell my master of the change in my feelings I told him I should tell him in the morning And what he asked will you do if he whips you still for praying and going to meeting I said I will ask Jesus to help me bear the pain and to forgive my master for being so wicked He then said Well then Brother Jones I believe that you are a Christian A good many of us went from the meeting to a brother's cabin where we began to express our joy in happy songs The palace of General Dudley was only a little way off and he soon sent over a slave with orders to stop our noise or he would send the patrolers upon us We then stopped our singing and spent the remainder of the night in talking rejoicing and praying It was a night of very great happiness to me The contrast between my feelings then and for many weeks previous was very great Now all was bright and joyous in my relations towards my precious Saviour I felt certain that Jesus was my Saviour and in this blessed assurance a flood of glory and joy filled my happy soul But this sweet night passed away and as the morning came I felt that I must go home and bear the slave's heavy cross I went and told my mistress the blessed change in my feelings She promised me what aid she could give with my master and enjoined upon me to be patient and very faithful to his interest and in this way I should at length wear out his opposiition to my praying and going to meeting I went down to the store in a very happy state of mind I told James my feelings He called me a fool and said master would be sure to whip me I told him I hoped I should be able to bear it and to forgive master for his cruelty to me Master came down talked with me a while and told me that he should whip me because I had disobeyed him in staying out all night He had told me he should whip me if ever I did so and he should make every promise good So I began to take off my clothes He called me a crazy fool and told me to keep my clothes on till he told me to take them off He whipped me over my jacket but I enjoyed so much peace of mind that I scarcely felt the cow hide This was the last whipping that Mr Jones inflicted upon me I was then nearly eighteen years old I waited and begged for a paper to join the Church six months before I could get it But all this time I was cheerful as far as a slave can be and very earnest to do all I could for my master and mistress I was resolved to convince them that I was happier and better for being a Christian and my master at last acknowledged that he could not find any fault with my conduct and that it was impossible to find a more faithful slave than I was to him And so at last he gave a paper to Ben English the leader of the colored members and I joined the love feast and was taken into the Church on trial for six months I was put into Billy Cochran's class At the expiration of six months I was received into the Church in full fellowship Quaker Davis' class I remained there three years My master was much kinder after this time than he had formerly been and I was allowed some more time to myself than I had been before I pursued my studies as far as I could but I soon found the utter impossibility of carrying on my studies as I wished to do I was a slave and all avenues to real improvement I found guarded with jealous care and cruel tenacity against the despised and desolate bondman I still felt a longing desire to improve to be free but the conviction was getting hold of my soul that I was only struggling in vain when seeking to elevate myself into a manly and happy position And now my mind was fast sinking into despair I could read and write and often enjoyed much happiness in poring over the very few books I could obtain and especially at times I found great peace in reading my old worn Testament But I wanted now that hope which had filled my mind with such joy when I first began to learn to read I found much happiness in prayer But here also my mind labored in sadness and darkness much of the time About this time my master was taken sick On Sunday he was prostrated by mortal pains and on Friday the same week he died He left fifteen slaves I was purchased by Owen Holmes for I was then in my twenty third year I had just passed through the darkest season of despairing agony that I had yet known This came upon me in consequence of the visit which I have already described to my dear old desolate home About this time too I entered into a new and distinct period of life which I will unfold in another I will close this period of sorrow and shame with a few lines of touching interest to my mind Who shall avenge the slave I stood and cried The earth the earth the echoing sea replied I turned me to the ocean but each wave Declined to be the avenger of the slave Who shall avenge the slave my species cried The winds the flood the lightning of the sky I turned to these from them one echo ran The right avenger of the slave is man Man was my fellow in his sight I stood Wept and besought him by the voice of blood Sternly he looked as proud on earth he trod Then said the avenger of the slave is GOD I looked in prayer towards Heaven a while 'twas still And then methought God's voice replied I WILL SECOND I enter now upon a new development of wrongs and woes which I as slave was called to undergo I must go back some two or three years from the time when my master died and I was sold to Owen Holmes The bitterness of persecution which master Jones had kept up against me so long because I would try to serve the Lord had passed away I was permitted to pray and to go to our meetings without molestation My master laid aside his terrible severity towards me By his treatment of me afterwards he seemed to feel that he had done me wrong in scourging me as he had done because I could not obey his wicked command to stop praying and to keep a way from the meetings For after the time of my joining the Church he allowed me to go to all the meetings and granted to me many other little favors which I had never before received from him About this time I began to feel very lonely I wanted a friend to whom I could tell my story of sorrows of unsatisfied longing of new and fondly cherished plans I wanted a companion whom I could love with all my warm affections who should love me in return with a true and fervent heart of whom I might think when toiling for a selfish unfeeling master who should dwell fondly on my memory when we were separated during the severe labors of the day and with whom I might enjoy the blessed happiness of social endearments after the work of each day was over My heart yearned to have a home if it was only the wretched home of the unprotected slave to have a wife to love me and to love It seems to me that no one can have such fondness of love and such intensity of desire for home and home affections as the poor slave Despised and trampled upon by a cruel race of unfeeling men the bondman must die in the prime of his wretched life if he finds no refuge in a dear home where love and sympathy shall meet him from hearts made sacred to him by his own irrepressible affection and tenderness for them A nd so I sought to love and to win a true heart in return I did this too with a full knowledge of thy desperate agony that the slave husband and father is exposed to Had I not seen this in the anguish of my own parents Yea I saw it in every public auction where men and women and children were brought upon the block examined and bought I saw it on such occasions in the hopeless agony depicted on the countenance of husband and wife there separated to meet no more in this cruel world and in the screams of wild despair and useless entreaty which the mother then deprived of her darling child sent forth I heard the doom which stares every slave parent in the face each waking and sleeping hour of an unhappy life And yet I sought to become a husband and a father because I felt that I could live no longer unloved and unloving I was married to Lucilla Smith the slave of Mrs Moore We called it and we considered it a true marriage although we knew well that marriage was not permitted to the slaves as a sacred right of the loving heart Lucilla was seventeen years old when we we were married I loved her with all my heart and she gave me a return for my affections with which I was contented Oh God of Love thou knowest what happy hours we have passed in each other's society in our poor cabin When we knelt in prayer we never forgot to ask God to save us from the misery of cruel separation while life and love were our portion Oh how we have talked of this dreaded fate and wept in mingling sorrow as we thought of our desolation if we should be parted and doomed to live on weary years away from each other's dear presence We had three dear little babes Our fondness for our precious children increased the current feeling of love for each other which filled our hearts They were bright precious things those little babes at least so they seemed to us Lucilla and I were never tired of planning to improve their condition as far as might be done for slaves We prayed with new fervency to our Father in heaven to protect our precious babes Lucilla was very proud of me because I could read and write and she often spoke of my teaching our dear little ones and then she would say with tears Who knows Thomas but they may yet be free and happy Lucilla was a valuable slave to her mistress She was a seamstress and very expert at her needle I had a constant dread that Mrs Moore her mistress would be in want of money and sell my dear wife We constantly dreaded a final separation Our affections for each other was very strong and this made us always apprehensive of a cruel parting These fears were well founded as our sorrowing hearts too soon learned A few years of very pure and constant happiness for slaves passed away and we were parted to meet but once again till we met in Eternity Mrs Moore left Wilmington and moved to Newburn She carried with her my beloved Lucilla and my three children Annie four years old Lizzie two and a half years and our sweet little babe Charlie She remained there eighteen months And Oh how lonely and dreary and desponding were those months of lonely life to my crushed heart My dear wife and my precious children were seventy four miles distant from me carried away from me in utter scorn of my beseeching words I was tempted to put an end to my wretched life I thought of my dear family by day and by night A deep despair was in my heart such as no one is called to bear in such cruel crushing power as the poor slave severed forever from the objects of his love by the rapacity of his brother But that dark time of despair passed away and I saw once more my wife and children Mrs Moore left Newburn for Tuscaloosa Ala and passing through Wilmington on her journey she spent one night in her old home That night I passed with my wife and children Lucilla had pined away under the agony of our separation even more than I had done That night she wept on my bosom and we mingled bitter tears together Our dear children were baptized in the tears of agony that were wrung from our breaking hearts May a just God remember that night in the last award that we and our oppressors are to receive The next morning Mrs Moore embarked on board the packet I followed my wife and childen to the boat and parted from them without a word of farewell Our sobs and tears were our only adieu Our hearts were too full of anguish for any other expression of our hopeless woe I have never seen that dear family nor have I heard from them since I parted from them there God only knows the bitterness of my agony experienced in the separation of my wife and children from me The memory of that great woe will find a fresh impression on my heart while that heart shall beat How will the gifted and the great meet the charge against them at the great day as the Judge shall say to them in stern displeasure I was sick destitute imprisoned helpless and ye ministered not unto me for when ye slighted and despised these wretched pleading slaves ye did these acts of scorn against me Depart ye workers of iniquity After my purchase by Owen Holmes I hired my time at per year paid monthly I rented a house of Dr E J Derset I worked loading and unloading vessels that came into Wilmington and could earn from one dollar to a dollar and a quarter a day While my wife and family were spared to bless my home by their presence and love I was comparatively happy But I found then that the agony of the terrible thought I am a slave my wife is a slave my precious children are slaves grew bitter and unsupportable just as the happiness in the society of my beloved home became more distinct and abounding And this one cup of bitterness was ever at my lips Hearts of kind sympathy tender pity did I not drain that cup of bitter woe to its very dregs when my family were carried off into returnless exile and I was left a heartbroken lonely man Can you still be inactive while thousands are drinking that portion of despair every year in this land of schools and Bibles After I parted from my family I continued to toil on but not as I had done before No home was darker than the holds of ships in which I worked Its light the bright joyous light of love and sympathy and mutual endearments was quenched Ah me how dark it left my poor heart It was colder than the winter wind and frost the warm sunshine was snatched away and my poor heart froze in its bitter cold Its gloom was deeper than prison or cave could make it Was not there the deserted chairs and beds once occupied by the objects of a husband's and a father's deep love Deserted How and why The answer is it not the unqualified condemnation of the government and religion of this land I could not go into my cold dark cheerless house the sight of its deserted rooms was despair to my soul So I worked on taking jobs whenever I could get them and worked often till nearly morning and never going to my home for rest till I could toil no more And so I passed four years and I began to feel that I could not live in utter loneliness any longer My heart was still and always yearning for affection and sympathy and loving communion My wife was torn from me I had ceased to hope for another meeting with her in this world of oppression and suffering so I sat down and wrote to Lucilla that I could live alone no longer and saying to her the sad farewell which we could not say when we were sundered I asked Mary R Moore to come and cheer me in my desolate home She became my wife and thank God she has been rescued from slavery by the blessing of God and my efforts to save her She is now my wife and she is with me today and till death parts us secure from the iron hand of slavery Three of our dear children are with us too in the old Commonwealth I cannot say they are in a free land for even here in the city of Boston where I am told is kept the old cradle of liberty my precious children are excluded from the public schools because their skin is black Still Boston is better than Wilmington inasmuch as the rulers of this place permit me to send my children to any school at all After my second marriage I hired my wife of her master and paid for her time a year for three years We had one child while Mary was a slave That child is still in chains The fourth year by the aid of a white friend I purchased my wife for We had before determined to try to accomplish this enterprise in order that our dear babes might be free Besides I felt that I could not bear another cruel separation from wife and children Yet the dread of it was strong and unceasing upon my mind So we made a box and through a hole in the top we put in every piece of money from five cents up to a dollar that we could save from our hard earnings This object nerved us for unceasing toil for twenty months or about that time What hopes and fears beset us as those months wore away I have been compelled to hide that box in a hole dug for it when I knew the patrollers were coming to search my cabin For well do I know if they found my box I should be penniless again How often have I started and turned in sudden and terrible alarm as I have dropped a piece of money into my box and heard its loud ring upon the coin below lest some prowling enemy should hear it and steal from me my boarded treasure And how often have I started up in my sleep as the storm bas beat aloud upon my humble home with the cry of unspeakable agony in my heart Then O God they have taken my box and my wife and babes are still slaves When my box was broken open I still lacked a little of the necessary to buy my wife The kind friend who had promised to aid me in my contemplated purchase made up the deficiency and I became the owner of my wife We had three children at this time and O how my crushed heart was uplifted in its pride and joy as I took them in my arms and thought that they were not slaves After I had purchased my wife we still worked hard and saved our earnings with great care in order to get some property in hand for future use As I saved my earnings I got a white man whom I thought my friend his name I choose to keep for the present to lay it out for me In this way I became the owner of the cabin in which I lived and two other small houses all of which were held in the name of this supposed friend He held them in his own name for me A slave cannot hold property I will here remark that I was deceived by this man and when I ran away from my chains after sending on my family I was compelled to sacrifice the whole of this property I left it because I could not get my own in his hands and come off entirely destitute Thank God I got a way and now I have no tears to shed over the loss of my houses During the winter of a kind lady came and told me that some white men were plotting to enslave my wife and children again She advised me to get them off to the free States as quickly and secretly as possible A lawyer of Wilmington told me they were not safe unless emancipated by a special act of the Legislature He was a member of the House and tried to get through the House a bill for their emancipation But there was so much ill feeling upon this question that he could not do it The Legislature threw it aside at once He then advised me to get them off to the free States as my only course to save them This I determined to do if possible I kept a good look out for a vessel I found one and made a bargain with the captain to take on board for New York a free colored woman and her three children A kind friend gave me a certificate of their freedom to the captain and I brought my wife and children on board at night paid the captain for their fare and staid on the wharf in torturing fear till about sunrise when I saw the vessel under way It was soon out of sight When I went home I threw myself on my knees and poured out my soul to God to carry that ship and its precious cargo safely and swiftly on to a free haven and to guard and guide me soon to a free home with my beloved family And so I kept on praying working hoping pining for neartly three weeks when I received the happy news that my dear ones were safe with a true hearted friend in Brooklyn I had notified him before hand that they were coming and now the good and glorious news came that they were safe with Robert H Cousins where the slaveholder could trouble them no more I had arranged with Mary when she left to come on myself as soon as I could get the money for my houses and land She was to write to me as though she had gone to New York on a visit intending to come back and she was to speak of New York as if she did not like it at all I knew my master would be very angry when he heard she had gone unbeknown to him and thought he would demand to see the letters my wife if she should get friends in New York to write to me for her and so I made ready to meet and quiet his suspicious while I was plotting my own escape For more than three months I tried to get the money or part of it for my houses but was put off and deceived till I found I must come off without a cent of the property I had tried so hard to accumulate I was required to call and see my master every day because he suspected me of a design to run away He was taken suddenly sick and I then started for my wife and children to whom I arrived shortly afterwards WILD TOM OF THE ISLAND RETREAT INTRODUCTION WILD TOM the hero of our story was of unmixed African blood and the slave of Gen Carter He possessed an excellent character for integrity and capability was a devoted and faithful convert to the Methodist persuasion but the suffering he endured through the tyrannical practices of slavery served to harden his heart and eventually to extinguish the light of religion in his soul ANN the wife of Thomas was a pretty sprightly good natured girl whom he loved exceedingly She was whipped to death by Martin an overseer on Gen Carter's plantation ARCHY MOORE was son of Mr Moore his master by a Slave mother He was nearly white in his complexion but yet a crushed Slave FIRST SINCE the death of his wife a remarkable change had taken place in my friend Thomas He had lost his former air of contentment and good nature and had grown morose and sullen Instead of being the most willing and industrious laborer in the field as he used to be he seemed to have imbibed a strong dislike for work and he slighted and neglected his task as much as possible Had he been under any other driver than myself his idleness and neglect would have frequently brought him into trouble But I loved and pitied him and I screened him all I could The wrongs and injuries that had been inflicted upon him since his arrival at Locsahachee seemed to have subverted all the principles upon which he had so long acted It was a subject on which he did not seem inclined to converse and upon which I was unwilling to press him but I had abundent reason to suspect that he had totally renounced the religion in which he had been so carefully instructed and which for so long a time had excercised so powerful an influence over him He had secretly returned to the practice of certain wild rites which in his early youth he had learned from his mother who had herself been kidnapped from the coast of Africa and who had been as he had often told me zealously devoted to her country's superstitions He would sometimes talk wildly and incoherently about having seen the spirit of his departed wife and of some promise he had made to the apparition and I was led to believe that he suffered under occasional fits of partial insanity At all events he was in most respects an altered man He had ceased to be the humble and obedient slave contented with his lot and zealously devoted to his master's service Instead of promoting his master's interest it seemed now to be his study and his aim to do as much mischief as possible There were two or three artful daring unquiet spirits on the plantation from whom till lately he had kept aloof but whose acquaintance he now sought and whose confidence he soon obtained They found him bold and prudent and what was more trusty and magnanimous and they soon gave place to his superiority of intellect and acknowledged him as their leader They were joined by some others whose only motives was the desire of plunder and they extended their depredations to every part of the plantation In this new character Thomas still gave evidence that he was no ordinary man He conducted his enterprises with singular address and when all other stratagems by which to save his companions from detection proved unavailing he had still one resourse that showed the native nobleness of his soul Such was the steady firmness of his mind and the masculine vigor of his constitution that he was enabled to do what few men could He could brave even the torture of the lash a torture I have said already not less terrible than that of the rack itself When every other resourse failed him he was ready to shield his companions by a voluntary confession and to concentrate upon himself a punishment which he knew that some among them were too feeble and faint hearted to endure Magnanimity such as this is esteemed even in a freeman the highest pitch of virtue how then shall we sufficiently admire it in a slave Thank God tyranny is not omnipotent Though it crush its victims to the earth and tread them into the dust and brutify them by every possible invention it cannot totally extinguish the spirit of manhood within them Here it glimmers and there it secretly burns sooner or later to burst forth in a flame that will not be quenched and cannot be kept under So long as I was in the confidence of Mr Martin I was able to render Thomas essential service by informing him of the suspicions plans and stratagems of the overseer It was not long however before I forfeited that confidence not because Mr Martin entertained any suspicion of my playing him false for it was very easy to throw dust in the eyes of so stupid a fellow but because I did not come up to his notions of the spirit and the duty of a driver The season was sickly and as the hands who composed my gang were from a more northern climate and not yet seasoned to the pestiferous atmosphere of a rice plantation they suffered a good deal from sickness and several of them were often unable to work I had explained to Mr Martin and he seemed to be satisfied with my explanation but riding into the field one day in a particularly bad humor and I believe little excited with liquor he got into a towering rage at finding not half my gang in the field and more than half the tasks untouched He demanded the reason I told him that the hands were sick He swore they had no businsss to be sick he was tired he said of this talk about sickness he knew very well it was all sham and he was determined to be imposed upon no longer If any more complaints are made of sickness Archy you have nothing to do but whip the scoundrels and set them to work What said I if they are really sick Sick or not sick I tell you If they are not sick a whipping is no more than they deserve and if they are why nothing is so likely to do them good as a little bloodletting In that case said I you had better appoint another driver I should make but a poor hand at whipping sick people Hold your tongue you damned insolent blackguard Who gave you leave to advise me or dispute my orders Hand me your whip you rascal I did so and Mr Martin thereupon administered upon me a fresh infliction of that same discipline he had bestowed when he first put the whip into my hand So ended my drivership and though I now lost my double allowance and was obliged to turn into the field again and perform my task like the other hands I cannot say that I much regretted it It was a pitiful and sorry office which no one but a scoundrel ever ought to undertake I now united myself more closely to the party of Thomas and joined heart and hand in all their enterprises Our depredations became at last so considerable that Mr Martin was obliged to establish a regular watch consisting of his drivers and a few of their subordinates who kept prowling about the plantation all night and made it unsafe to venture into the fields This arrangement was hastened by a circumstance that happened upon that plantation about which a very strict inquiry was instituted but which led to no definate result On one and the same night General Carter's splendid plantation seat and his extensive rice mills were discovered to be on fire and notwithstanding all efforts to save them both were totally consumed Several of the slaves and Thomas among the rest were put to a sort of torture to make them acknowledge some participation inthis house burning That cruelty availed nothing They all stoutly denied knowing any thing about it I was as I have said very much in Thomas's confidence yet he never spoke to me about that fire As he was one of those men who know how to keep their own secrets I always suspected that he knew much more about the matter than he choose to divulge At all events it was evidently a much more potent feeling than the mere love of plunder by which Thomas was actuated Since his wife's death he sometimes drank to excess but this was seldom and there never was a man more temperate in his meats and drinks or less fistiduous than Thomas generally was He had formerly dressed with much neatness now he neglected his dress altogether He did not love society he had little intercourse with any body except with me and it was not always that he seemed to wish even for my company Thomas had little use for his share of the plunder and in fact he generally distributed it among his companions When the thing was first proposed he seemed to have little inclination to extend our depredations beyond the limits of Loosahachee But as it was no longer safe to continue them there and his companions had rioted too long in plunder to be willing to relinquish it Thomas yielded at last to their urgent solicitations and led us night after night to the neighboring plantations We soon pushed our proceedings so far as to attract the notice of the overseer whose domains we had invaded At first they supposed that the thieves were to be looked for at home and numberless were the severities they exercised upon those whom they suspected But in spite of all their cruelties the depredations were still continued and such was the singular art and cunning which Thomas displayed in varying the scene and manner of our visits that for a long time we escaped all the traps and ambushes that were planned against us We were one night in a rice field and had almost filled our bags when the watchful ear of Thomas detected a sound as if of some one cautiously approaching He supposed it might be the patrol which of late instead of whiling away their time by the help of a fiddle and a bottle of whishey had grown more active and actually performed some of the duties of a night watch Under this impression he gave a signal for us to steal off quietly in a certain order which he had arranged before hand The field was bordered on one side by a deep and wide river from which it was protected by a high embankment We had come by water and our canoe lay in the river under the shade of a clump of bushes and small trees which grew upon the dike One by one we cautionsly stole over the bank carefully keeping in the shade of the bushes and all but Thomas were already in the boat We were waiting for our leader who as usual was the last man in the retreat when we heard several shouts and cries which seemed to indicate that he was discovered if not taken The sound of two musket shots fired in rapid succession increased our terror We hastily shoved the boat from the shore and pushing her into the current of the flood tide which was setting up the river we were carried rapidly and silently out of sight of our landing place The shouts were still continued but they grew fainter and fainter and seemed to take a direction from the river We now put out our paddles and plying with all our strength we pretty soon reached a small cove or creek the place where we kept our boat and at which we were accustomed to embark We drew the canoe on shore and carefully concealed it among the high grass Then without taking out our rice bags and leaving our shoes in the boat we ran towards Loosahachee which we reached without any further adventure I was very anxious about Thomas but I had scarcely thrown myself upon my bed before I heard a light tap at the door of my cabin which I know to be his I sprang up and let him in He was panting for breath and covered with mud Thomas said that just as he was going to climb the embankment he looked behind him and saw two men rapidly approaching They seemed to observe him just at the same moment and called to him to stop If he had attempted to reach the boat it would have drawn them that way and perhaps led to the detection of the whole company The moment they called to him he dropped his riee bag and stooping as low as he could he pushed rapidly through the rice in a direction from the river His pursuers raised a loud shout and fired their muskets at him but without effect He jumped several cross ditches made for the high ground at distance from the river and drew off the patrol in that direction They pursued him closely but as he was very strong and active and well acquainted with the place he succeeded in escaping from among the ditches and embankments of the rice field gained the high grounds and took a direction towards Loosahachee But though he had distanced his pursuers they had still kept upon his track and he expected that they would follow him up and would shortly be arriving While Thomas was telling his adventures he had stripped off his wet clothes and washed off the mud with which he was covered I furnished him with a dry suit which he took with him to his own cabin which was close by mine I hastened round to the cabins of our companions and told them what visitors to expect The barking of all the plantation dogs pretty soon informed us that the patrol were coming They had roused the overseer and with torches in their hands they entered and searched every cabin in the quarter But we were prepared for their visit we were roused with difficulty out of a deep sleep and seemed to be very much astonished at this unseasonable disturbance The search proved to be a very useless one but as the patrol were certain that they had traced the fugitive to Loosahachee the overseer of the plantation upon which we had been depredating came over the next morning to search out and punish the culprit He was accompanied by several other men who it seems were freeholders of the district selected with such forms or rather such neglect of all form as the law of Carolina prescribe in such cases Five Carolina freeholders selected at hap hazard constitute such a court as in most other countries would hardly be trusted with the final adjudication of any matter above the value of forty shillings at the amount A table was set out before the door of the overseer's house some glasses and a bottle of whiskey were placed upon it and the court proceeded to business We were all brought up and examined one after the other The only witnesses were the patrol who had pursued Thomas and they were ordered by the court to pick out the culprits That was rather a difficult matter There were between sixty and seventy men of us the night had been cloudy and without a moon and the patrol had only caught some hasty and uncertain glimpses of the person whom they had followed The court seemed rather vexed at their hesitation Yet perhaps it was not very unreasonable since they were quite unable to agree together as to what sort of a man it was One thought him short the other was certain that he was quite tall The first pronounced him a stout well set fellow the other had taken him to be very slender By this time the first bottle of whiskey was emptied and a second was put on the table The court now told the witnesses that it would not do they did not come up to the mark at all and if they went on at that rate the fellow would escape altogether Just at this moment the overseer of the plantation which had been plundered rode up and as soon as he had dismounted he stepped forward to the relief of the witnesses He said that while the court was organizing he had taken the opportunity to ride over and examine the rice field in which the rogue had been started up It was much trampled in places and there were a great many foot prints but they were all just alike and seemed to have been made by the same person He took a little stick from his pocket on which he said he had carefully marked their exact length and breadth Now this was a trick for detecting people which Thomas understood very well and he had taken good care to be prepared for it Our whole company were provided with shoes of the largest size we could get and all exactly of the same pattern This speech of the overseer seemed to revive the drooping hopes of the judges and they made us all sit down upon the ground and to have our feet measured There was a man on the plantation named Billy a harmless stupid fellow wholly unconnected with us but unluckily for him the only one of all the slaves whose foot corresponded at all with the measure The length of this poor fellow's foot was fatal to him The judges shouted with one voice and in the style of condemnation to be expected from such a court that they would be damned if he was not the thief It was in vain that the poor fellow denied the charge and pleaded for mercy His terror confusion and surprise only served to confirm the opinion of his guilt and the more he denied and the louder he pleaded the more positively his judges were determined against him Without further ceremony they pronounced him guilty and sentenced him to be hung The sentence was no sooner pronounced than preperations were made for its execution An empty barrel was brought out and placed under a tree that stood before the door The poor fellow was mounted upon it the halter was put about his neck and fastened to a limb over his head At first they could get no one willing to act as executioner but after becoming so drunk that they had lost all sense of judical decorum or piety one of them kicked or was rather pushed against the barrel and the poor victim of Carolina justice was launched into eternity The execution over the slaves were sent into the field while Martin with the judges and witnesses and several others whom the fame of the trial had drawn to Loosahachee commenced a regular drunken debauch which they kept up all that day and the night following SECOND The authority of masters over their slaves is in general a continual reign of terror A base and dastard fear is the sole principle of human nature to which the slave holder appeals When it was determined to hang the poor fellow whose fate I have described in the last his judges could not know nor do I suppose they much cared whether he was innocent or guilty Their great object was to terrify the survivors and by an example of what they would denominate wholesome and necessary severity to deter others from any further trespasses upon the neighboring plantations In this they succeeded for though Thomas endeavored to keep up our spirits we were thoroughly scared and felt but little inclination to second his boldness which seemed to grow more determined the more obstacles encountered One of our confederates in particular was so alarmed at the fate of poor Billy that he seemed to have lost all self control and we were in constant fear lest he should betray us When the first paroxysm of his terror was at its height the evening after he had witnessed the execution I believe he would gladly have confessed the whole if he could have found a white man sober enough to listen to him After a while he grew more calm but in the course of the day he had dropped some hints which were carefully treasured up by one of the drivers He reported them as I discovered to the overseer but Mr Martin had not yet recovered from the effects of the frolic and he was too drunk and stupid to understand a word that the driver said to him We had begun to get the better of our fears when a new incident happened which determined us to seek our safety in flight Some persons in passing along the river bank had discovered our canoe which in the hurry of our retreat we had taken too little care to conceal It contained not only our bags full of rice for we had not yet recovered courage enough to go after them but our shoes also all exactly of the same size and corresponding with the measure which had been produced upon the trial Here was ample proof that quite a number had been engaged in the scene of depradation and as one of the company had been raced to Loosachachee it would be reasonable to look for the others upon the same plantation Luckily I obtained an early intimation of this discovery by means of one of the overseer's house servants with whom I had the policy to keep up a pretty intimate connection A man had arrived at the overseer's house his horse dripping with foam and with an appearance of great haste and impatience he had asked to see the overseer The moment he came in the stranger requesed to speak with him alone and Mr Martin took his guest into another room and locked the door The girl who was my spy and informant under an appearance of the greatest simplicity was artful and intelligent and she was prompted to overhear this secret conversation as much by her own curiosity as by the suspicion that it might possibly be something in which I would take an interest She contrived to conceal herself in a closet which was separated from the room in which the overseer and his visitor were conversing only by a thin partition and having overheard his story the substance of which I have already mentioned and learned besides that the court would hold a new session at Loosahachee the day following she hastened to inform me of what she had heard She knew nothing in particular of our affairs but she had reason to believe that this piece of news would not be entirely uninteresting to me I informed Thomas of what she had told me We agreed at once that our best chance of safety was in flight and we immediately communicated our intention and the cause of it to the rest of our confederates They were anxious to accompany us and we all resolved to be off that very night As soon as evening came on we stole away from the plantation and gained the woods in company As we anticipated that a very diligent search would be made for us we though it best to separate Thomas and myself resolved to keep together the others scattered and took various directions As long as the darkness lasted we travelled on as rapidly as we could When the morning began to appear we plunged into a thick swampy piece of woods and having broken down some branches and young trees we made as dry a bed as we were able and lay down to sleep We were much fatigued with our long and rapid journey and slept soundly It was past noon when we waked Our appetites were sharp but we had on provisions Just as we were beginning to consider what course it would be best to pursue we heard the distant baying of a hound Thomas listened for a moment and then exclaimed that he knew that cry It was a famous dog a cross of the blood hound which Mr Martin had long had in training and upon whose performances in tracking out runaways he very much prided himself The place where we were was a thick swamp inwhich it was difficult to move and not easy to stand To cross it would be impossible and we resolved to get into the edge of it where the ground was harder and the undergrowth thinner and to continue our flight We did so but the hound gained rapidly upon us and his baying sounded louder and louder Thomas drew a stout sharp knife which he carried in his pocket We were now just at the border where the dry ground came down upon the swamp and looking behind us across the level and open woods we could see the hound coming on with his nose to the ground and uttering at intervals a deep and savage cry Farther behind but still in full view we saw a man on horseback whom we took to be Mr Martin himself The dog was evidently upon our track and following it to the place where we had first plunged into the swamp he disappeared from our view But we could still hear his clamor which grew louder and almost constant and we soon perceived by the rustling and cracking of the underwood that he was close upon us At this moment we faced about and stood at bay Thomas in front with his knife in hand and I just behind with a sharp and heavy lightwood knot the best indeed the only weapon of which I could avail myself Presently the dog emerged from the swamp The moment he saw us he redoubled his cry and dashed forward foaming at Thomas's throat but only succeeded in seizing his left arm which Thomas raised as a shield against the dog's attack At the same instant he dealt a stroke with his knife which penetrated to the hilt and dog and man came struggling to the ground How the contest would have ended had Thomas been alone is very doubtful for though the hound soon received several wounds they only seemed to increase his ferocity and he still struggled to get at the throat of his antagonist My lightwood knot now did good service Two or three heavy blows upon the dog's head laid him senseless and sprawling on the ground While we had been awaiting the dog's attack and during the contest we had scarcely thought of his master but looking up after it was all over we discovered that Mr Martin was already very near us When the dog took to the swamp and came suddenly upon us before we had expected him He pointed his gun and called upon us to surrender Thomas no sooner saw the overseer than he seemed to lose all his self control and grasping his knife he rushed upon him Mr Martin fired but the buck shot rattled harmlessly among the trees and as he was attempting to wheel his horse Thomas dashed upon him seized him by the arm and dragged him to the ground The horse ran frightened through the woods and it was in vain that I attempted to stop him We looked round in expectation of seeing some others of the huntsmen coming up None were in sight and we seized the opportunity to retreat and to carry our prisoner into the covert of the swamp We learned from him that by the time the court and their attendants arrived at Loosahachee our flight had been discovered and that it was immediately resolved to raise the neighborhood and to commence a general search for the runaways All the horses dogs and men that could be come at were put in requisition They were divided into parties and immediately commenced beating through the woods and swamps in the neighborhood A party of five or six men with Mr Martin and his bloodhound had traced three of our companions into a thick swamp just on the bank of a river The pursuers dismounted and with their guns in their hands they followed the dog into the thicket Our poor fellows was so overcome with fatigue that they slept until the very moment that the hound sprang in upon them He seized one of them by the throat and held him to the ground The others ran and as they ran the pursuers fired One of the fugitives fell dead horribly mangled and cut to pieces with buck shot the other still continued his flight As soon as the dog could be compelled to quit his hold of the man he had seized which was not without difficulty and delay he was put upon the track of the surviving fugitive He followed it to the river where he stood at fault The man had probably plunged in and swam to the other side but as the dog conld not be made to take the water and as the swamp on the opposite bank was reputed to be very soft and dangerous no further pursuit was made the chase in that direction was given up and the poor fellow was suffered to escape for the present The pursuers now separated Two of them undertook to carry back to Loosahachee the captive they had taken and the other three with Mr Martin and his hound were to continue the hunt in search of the rest of us They learned from their captive the place at which we had parted company and the direction which the several parties had taken After beating about for some time the hound struck upon our trail and opened in full cry but the horses of Mr Martin's companions were so broken down that when he began to spur on to keep up with the hound he soon left them behind Mr Martin ended his story by advising us to go in and surrender ourselves giving us his word and honor for it as a gentleman and an overseer that if we would offer him no further violence or injury he would protect us from punishment and reward us most handsomely The sun was now setting The short twilight which follows Carolina sunset would soon be succeeded by the darkness of a cloudy and moonless night and we felt but little apprehension of being immediately troubled by our pursuers I looked at Thomas as if to inquire what we had better do He drew me aside having first examined the fastenings of our prisoner whom we had bound to a tree by some cords found in his own pocket and which were doubtless intended for a very different purpose Thomas paused for a moment as if to collect his thoughts then pointing to Mr Martin Archy he said that man dies to night There was a wild energy and at the same time a steady coolness in the tone in which he spoke It started me at first I made no answer and as meanwhile I looked Thomas in the face I saw there an expression of stern exultation and a fixedness of purpose not to be shaken His eyes flashed fire as he repeated but in a low and quiet tone that contrasted strangely with the matter of his speech I tell you Archy that man dies to night She commands it I have promised it and now the time is come Who commands it I hastily inquired Do you ask who Archy that man was the murderer of my wife Though Thomas and I had lived in great intimacy that was almost the first time since the death of his wife that he had mentioned her to me in such plain terms He had it is true now and then made some distant allusions to her and I recollected that on several occasions before he had dropped some strange and incoherent hints about an intercourse which he still kept up with her The mention of his wife brought tears into his eyes but with his hand he wiped them hastily away and soon recover s missing in the original copy all knowledge of any other runaways or that Wild Tom had any body with him To make all sure eight or ten of the company were sent to patrol on horsebock round the edges of the swamp together with all the dogs but one while five or six of the strongest and most resolute proposed to penetrate the interior and to storm the Island Retreat The prisoner with the rope still about his neck the other end made fast to the waist of one of the stoutest of the company was required to serve as guide and though he protested that he knew nothing in particular of the approaches to the island he was threatened with instant death in case he did not conduct them safely and expeditiously across The fellow however whether through ignorance or design led them into very deep water in some places fairly up to their necks through which they were obliged to wade holding their rifles and powder horns over their heads and in spite of every effort to keep him quiet as the party drew near the island he would insist on crying out as if giving directions as to the passage but as was strongly suspected with the real design of alarming his confederate And indeed before the party could make good their footing on the island he had already taken the alarm and had plunged into the water on the other side He had gained a considerable distance before he was seen and as he dodged behind the great trees of the swamp several rifle shots fired at him failed to take effect In plunged the others in fresh pursuit while the fugitive engrossed by this danger behind made the best of his way through the mud and water till he gained the firm land on the other side of the swamp where he encountered a new danger being seen by one of the scouts patrolling along the edge As he bounded through the piney woods like a deer a rifle shot gazed his side and though it did not bring him down yet it materially checked the swiftness of his flight Four or five horsemen were soon upon his track Snapdragon the overseer leading in the chase soon came up with the flying negro and after vainly calling to him to yield and firing his pistols with only slight effect sprang from his horse and attempted to seize him Snapdragon was a powerful man but he had now found his match Wild Tom exhausted and wounded as he was caught his assailant in his arms and as they rolled upon the ground the negro's knife was not long in finding its way to the overseer's heart But already the dogs and the other pursuers were upon him and before he could disengage himself he was made a prisoner and securely bound It was not long before the whole party was assembled when some of the more violent proposed to revenge the dead overseer by putting the prisoner to death on the spot But the pleasure and glory of making a parade and exhibition of their prize and the necessity too in order to secure the promised reward to identify him as general Carter's runaway had stayed this summary procedure and it had been resolved forthwith to hasten to the village which served as seat of justice for the county to commit the prisoners to jail As soon as an opportunity occurred I handed Tom a calabash of water which was rudely dashed from his hand by one of the slave drivers I felt at that same moment a hand rudely laid on my shoulder while a voice which I recognized as that of the same man who had dashed the calabash of water from Thomas's grasp exclaiming with a volley of oaths What the devil are you doing here in close confab with this murderer I tell you stranger you don't leave here without giving an account of yourself A number of men now rushed up to Thomas and began to unfasten his chains and to conduct him towards the door of the tavern These were the more drunken and infuriated portion of the company who enraged at the sight of the dead overseer wished to try and execute him at once but the others wished to await the arrival of general Carter for whom a messenger had been sent and to delay final proceedings till the prisoner had first been identified as general Carter's property lest otherwise there might be some difficulty in recovering the promised reward The more violent and drunken party had however prevailed A court of three freeholders was now organized on the spot and Thomas again surrounded by a rabble of blacks and whites was now brought before this august tribunal I was myself at the same time taken into custody as a suspected person with an intimation that my case should be attended to as soon as that of the negro was disposed of Whom do you belong to Such was the first question which the honorable court addressed to the prisoner I belong answered Thomas with much solemnity to the God who made us all The mock court after hearing a witness or two pronounced him guilty of the murder of the overseer after which they passed sentence of death A pile of wood was lighted and the victim of slave holding vengeance was placed in the midst of it while he looked upon his persecutors with a smile of contemptuous defiance and his spirit was ushered into the presence of an avenging God 
Josiah-Henson,THE LIFE OF JOSIAH HENSON FORMERLY A SLAVE NOW AN INHABITANT OF CANADA AS NARRATED BY HIMSELF BOSTON ARTHUR D PHELPS verso Entered according to Act of Congress in the year ARTHUR D PHELPS in the office of the Clerk of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts CAMBRIDGE PRINTED BY BOLLES AND HOUGHTON iii ADVERTISEMENT THE following memoir was written from the dictation of JOSIAH HENSON A portion of the story was told which when written was read to him that any errors of statement might be corrected The substance of it therefore the facts the reflections and very often the words are his and little more than the structure of the sentences belongs to another The narrative in this form necessarily loses the attraction derived from the earnest manner the natural eloquence of a man who tells a story in which he is deeply interested but it is hoped that enough remains to repay perusal and that the character of the man and the striking nature of the events of his life will be iv thought to justify the endeavor to make them more extensively known The story has this advantage that it is not fiction but fact and it will be found fruitful in instruction by those who attentively consider its lessons LIFE OF JOSIAH HENSON I WAS born June in Charles County Maryland on a farm belonging to Mr Francis N about a mile from Port Tobacco My mother was the property of Dr Josiah McP but was hired by Mr N to whom my father belonged The only incident I can remember which occurred while my mother continued on N 's farm was the appearance of my father one day with his head bloody and his back lacerated He was in a state of great excitement and though it was all a mystery to me at the age of three or four years it was explained at a later period and I understood that he had been suffering the cruel penalty of the Maryland law for beating a white man His right ear had been cut off close to his head and he had received a hundred lashes on his back He had beaten the overseer for a brutal assault on my mother and this was his punishment Furious at such treatment my father became a different man and was so morose disobedient and intractable that Mr N determined to sell him He accordingly parted with him not long after to his son who lived in Alabama and neither my mother nor I ever heard of him again He was naturally as I understood afterwards from my mother and other persons a man of amiable temper and of considerable energy of character but it is not strange that he should be essentially changed by such cruelty and injustice under the sanction of law After the sale of my father by N and his leaving Maryland for Alabama Dr McP would no longer hire out my mother to N She returned therefore to the estate of the doctor who was very much kinder to his slaves than the generality of planters never suffering them to be struck by any one He was indeed a man of good natural impulses kind hearted liberal and jovial The latter quality was so much developed as to be his great failing and though his convivial excesses were not thought of as a fault by the community in which he lived and did not even prevent his having a high reputation for goodness of heart and an almost saint like benevolence yet they were nevertheless his ruin My mother and her young family of three girls and three boys of which I was the youngest resided on this estate for two or three years during which my only recollections are of being rather a pet of the doctor's who thought I was a bright child and of being much impressed with what I afterwards recognized as the deep piety and devotional feeling and habits of my mother I do not know how or where she acquired her knowledge of God or her acquaintance with the Lord's prayer which she so frequently repeated and taught me to repeat I remember seeing her often on her knees endeavoring to arrange her thoughts in prayers appropriate to her situation but which amounted to little more than constant ejaculation and the repetition of short phrases which were within my infant comprehension and have remained in my memory to this hour After this brief period of comparative comfort however the death of Dr McP brought about a revolution in our condition which common as such things are in slave countries can never be imagined by those not subject to them nor recollected by those who have been without emotions of grief and indignation deep and ineffaceable The doctor was riding from one of his scenes of riotous excess when falling from his horse in crossing a little run not a foot deep he was unable to save himself from drowning In consequence of his decease it became necessary to sell the estate and the slaves in order to divide the property among the heirs and we were all put up at auction and sold to the highest bidder and scattered over various parts of the country My brothers and sisters were bid off one by one while my mother holding my hand looked on in an agony of grief the cause of which I but ill understood at first but which dawned on my mind with dreadful clearness as the sale proceeded My mother was then separated from me and put up in her turn She was bought by a man named Isaac R residing in Montgomery county and then I was offered to the assembled purchasers My mother half distracted with the parting forever from all her children pushed through the crowd while the bidding for me was going on to the spot where R was standing She fell at his feet and clung to his knees entreating him in tones that a mother only could command to buy her baby as well as herself and spare to her one of her little ones at least Will it can it be believed that this man thus appealed to was capable not merely of turning a deaf ear to her supplication but of disengaging himself from her with such violent blows and kicks as to reduce her to the necessity of creeping out of his reach and mingling the groan of bodily suffering with the sob of a breaking heart Yet this was one of my earliest observations of men an experience which has been common to me with thousands of my race the bitterness of which its frequency cannot diminish to any individual who suffers it while it is dark enough to overshadow the whole after life with something blacker than a funeral pall I was bought by a stranger Almost immediately however whether my childish strength at five or six years of age was overmastered by such scenes and experiences or from some accidental cause I fell sick and seemed to my new master so little likely to recover that he proposed to R the purchaser of my mother to take me too at such a trifling rate that it could not be refused I was thus providentially restored to my mother and under her care destitute as she was of the proper means of nursing me I recovered my health and grew up to be an uncommonly vigorous and healthy boy and man The character of R the master whom I faithfully served for many years is by no means an uncommon one in any part of the world but it is to be regretted that a domestic institution should anywhere put it in the power of such a one to tyrannize over his fellow beings and inflict so much needless misery as is sure to be produced by such a man in such a position Coarse and vulgar in his habits unprincipled and cruel in his general deportment and especially addicted to the vice of licentiousness his slaves had little opportunity for relaxation from wearying labor were supplied with the scantiest means of sustaining their toil by necessary food and had no security for personal rights The natural tendency of slavery is to convert the master into a tyrant and the slave into the cringing treacherous false and thieving victim of tyranny R and his slaves were no exception to the general rule but might be cited as apt illustrations of the nature of the case My earliest employments were to carry buckets of water to the men at work to hold a horse plough used for weeding between the rows of corn and as I grew older and taller to take care of master's saddle horse Then a hoe was put into my hands and I was soon required to do the day's work of a man and it was not long before I could do it at least as well as my associates in misery The every day life of a slave on one of our southern plantations however frequently it may have been described is generally little known at the North and must be mentioned as a necessary illustration of the character and habits of the slave and the slave holder created and perpetuated by their relative position The principal food of those upon my master's plantation consisted of corn meal and salt herrings to which was added in summer a little buttermilk and the few vegetables which each might raise for himself and his family on the little piece of ground which was assigned to him for the purpose called a truck patch The meals were two daily The first or breakfast was taken at o'clock after laboring from daylight and the other when the work of the remainder of the day was over The only dress was of tow cloth which for the young and often even for those who had passed the period of childhood consisted of a single garment something like a shirt but longer reaching to the ancles and for the older a pair of pantaloons or a gown according to the sex while some kind of round jacket or overcoat might be added in winter a wool hat once in two or three years for the males and a pair of coarse shoes once a year Our lodging was in log huts of a single small room with no other floor than the trodden earth in which ten or a dozen persons men women and children might sleep but which could not protect them from dampness and cold nor permit the existence of the common decencies of life There were neither beds nor furniture of any description a blanket being the only addition to the dress of the day for protection from the chillness of the air or the earth In these hovels were we penned at night and fed by day here were the children born and the sick neglected Such were the provisions for the daily toil of the slave Notwithstanding this system of management however I grew to be a robust and vigorous lad and at fifteen years of age there were few who could compete with me in work or in sport for not even the condition of a slave can altogether repress the animal spirits of the young negro I was competent to all the work that was done upon the farm and could run faster and farther wrestle longer and jump higher than anybody about me My master and my fellow slaves used to look upon me and speak of me as a wonderfully smart fellow and prophecy the great things I should do when I became a man A casual word of this sort sometimes overheard would fill me with a pride and ambition which some would think impossible in a negro slave degraded starved and abused as I was and had been from my earliest recollection But the love of superiority is not confined to kings and emperors and it is a positive fact that pride and ambition were as active in my soul as probably they ever were in that of the greatest soldier or statesman The objects I pursued I must admit were not just the same as theirs Mine were to be first in the field whether we were hoeing mowing or reaping to surpass those of my own age or indeed any age in athletic exercises and to obtain if possible the favorable regard of the petty despot who ruled over us This last was an exercise of the understanding rather than of the affections and I was guided in it more by what I supposed would be effectual than by a nice judgment of the propriety of the means I used I obtained great influence with my companions as well by the superiority I showed in labor and in sport as by the assistance I yielded them and the favors I conferred upon them from impulses which I cannot consider as wrong though it was necessary for me to conceal sometimes the act as well as its motive I have toiled and induced others to toil many an extra hour in order to show my master what an excellent day's work had been accomplished and to win a kind word or a benevolent deed from his callous heart In general indifference or a cool calculation of my value to him were my reward chilling those hopes of an improvement in my condition which was the ultimate object of my efforts I was much more easily moved to compassion and sympathy than he was and one of the means I took to gain the good will of my fellow sufferers was by taking from him some things that he did not give in part payment of my extra labor The condition of the male slave is bad enough Heaven knows but that of the female compelled to perform unfit labor sick suffering and bearing the burdens of her own sex unpitied and unaided as well as the toils which belong to the other has often oppressed me with a load of sympathy And sometimes when I have seen them starved and miserable and unable to help themselves I have helped them to some of the comforts which they were denied by him who owned them and which my companions had not the wit or the daring to procure Meat was not a part of our regular food but my master had plenty of sheep and pigs and sometimes I have picked out the best one I could find in the flock or the drove carried it a mile or two into the woods slaughtered it cut it up and distributed it among the poor creatures to whom it was at once food luxury and medicine Was this wrong I can only say that at this distance of time my conscience does not reproach me for it and that then I esteemed it among the best of my deeds By means of the influence thus acquired the increased amount of work done upon the farm and by the detection of the knavery of the overseer who plundered his employer for more selfish ends and through my watchfulness was caught in the act and dismissed I was promoted to be superintendent of the farm work and managed to raise more than double the crops with more cheerful and willing labor than was ever seen on the estate before Previous to my attaining this important station however an incident occurred of so powerful an influence on my intellectual development my prospect of improvement in character as well as condition my chance of religious culture and in short on my whole nature body and soul that it deserves especial notice and commemoration There was a person living at Georgetown a few miles only from R's plantation whose business was that of a baker and whose character was that of an upright benevolent Christian man He was noted especially for his detestation of slavery and his resolute avoidance of the employment of slave labor in his business He would not even hire a slave the price of whose toil must be paid to his master but contented himself with the work of his own hands and with such free labor as he could procure His reputation was high not only for this almost singular abstinence from what no one about him thought wrong but for his general probity and excellence This man occasionally served as a minister of the Gospel and preached in a neighborhood where preachers were somewhat rare at that period One Sunday when he was to officiate in this way at a place three or four miles distant my mother persuaded me to ask master's leave to go and hear him and although such permission was not given freely or often yet his favor to me was shown for this once by allowing me to go without much scolding but not without a pretty distinct intimation of what would befall me if I did not return immediately after the close of the service I hurried off pleased with the opportunity but without any definite expectations of benefit or amusement for up to this period of my life and I was then eighteen years old I had never heard a sermon nor any discourse or conversation whatever upon religious topics except what had been impressed upon me by my mother of the responsibility of all to a Supreme Being When I arrived at the place of meeting the services were so far advanced that the speaker was just beginning his discourse from the text Hebrews ii That he by the grace of God should taste of death for every man This was the first text of the Bible to which I had ever listened knowing it to be such I have never forgotten it and scarce a day has passed since in which I have not recalled it and the sermon that was preached from it The divine character of Jesus Christ his life and teachings his sacrifice of himself for others his death and resurrection were all alluded to and some of the points were dwelt upon with great power great at least to me who heard of these things for the first time in my life I was wonderfully impressed too with the use which the preacher made of the last words of the text for every man He said the death of Christ was not designed for the benefit of a select few only but for the salvation of the world for the bond as well as the free and he dwelt on the glad tidings of the Gospel to the poor the persecuted and the distressed its deliverance to the captive and the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free till my heart burned within me and I was in a state of the greatest excitement at the thought that such a being as Jesus Christ had been described should have died for me for me among the rest a poor despised abused slave who was thought by his fellow creatures fit for nothing but unrequited toil and ignorance for mental and bodily degradation I immediately determined to find out something more about Christ and him crucified and revolving the things which I had heard in my mind as I went home I became so excited that I turned aside from the road into the woods and prayed to God for light and for aid with an earnestness which however unenlightened was at least sincere and heartfelt and which the subsequent course of my life has led me to imagine might not have been unacceptable to Him who heareth prayer At all events I date my conversion and my awakening to a new life a consciousness of superior powers and destiny to any thing I had before conceived of from this day so memorable to me I used every means and opportunity of inquiry into religious matters and so deep was my conviction of their superior importance to every thing else so clear my perception of my own faults and so undoubting my observation of the darkness and sin that surrounded me that I could not help talking much on these subjects with those about me and it was not long before I began to pray with them and exhort them and to impart to the poor slaves those little glimmerings of light from another world which had reached my own eye In a few years I became quite an esteemed preacher among them and I will not believe it is vanity which leads me to think I was useful to some I must return however for the present to the course of my life in secular affairs the facts of which it is my principal object to relate The difference between the manner in which it was designed that all men should regard one another as children of the same Father and the manner in which men actually do treat each other as if they were placed here for mutual annoyance and destruction is well exemplified by an incident that happened to me within a year or two from this period that is when I was nineteen or twenty years old My master's habits were such as were common enough among the dissipated planters of the neighborhood and one of their frequent practices was to assemble on Saturday or Sunday which were their holidays and gamble run horses or fight game cocks discuss politics and drink whiskey and brandy and water all day long Perfectly aware that they would not be able to find their own way home at night each one ordered a slave his particular attendant to come after him and help him home I was chosen for this confidential duty by my master and many is the time I have held him on his horse when he could not hold himself in the saddle and walked by his side in darkness and mud from the tavern to his house Of course quarrels and brawls of the most violent description were frequent consequences of these meetings and whenever they became especially dangerous and glasses were thrown dirks drawn and pistols fired it was the duty of the slaves to rush in and each one was to drag his master from the fight and carry him home To tell the truth this was a part of my business for which I felt no reluctance I was young remarkably athletic and self relying and in such affrays I carried it with a high hand and would elbow my way among the whites whom it would have been almost death for me to strike seize my master and drag him out mount him on his horse or crowd him into his buggy with the ease with which I would handle a bag of corn and at the same time with the pride of conscious superiority and the kindness inspired by performing an act of benevolence I knew I was doing for him what he could not do for himself and showing my superiority to others and acquiring their respect in some degree at the same time On one of these occasions my master got into a quarrel with his brother's overseer who was one of the party and in rescuing the former I suppose I was a little more rough with the latter than usual I remember his falling upon the floor and very likely it was from the effects of a push from me or a movement of my elbow He attributed his fall to me rather than to the whiskey he had drunk and treasured up his vengeance for the first favorable opportunity About a week afterwards I was sent by my master to a place a few miles distant on horseback with some letters I took a short cut through a lane separated by gates from the high road and bounded by a fence on each side This lane passed through some of the farm owned by my master's brother and his overseer was in the adjoining field with three negroes when I went by On my return a half an hour afterwards the overseer was sitting on the fence but I could see nothing of the black fellows I rode on utterly unsuspicious of any trouble but as I approached he jumped off the fence and at the same moment two of the negroes sprung up from under the bushes where they had been concealed and stood with him immediately in front of me while the third sprang over the fence just behind me I was thus enclosed between what I could no longer doubt were hostile forces The overseer seized my horse's bridle and ordered me to alight in the usual elegant phraseology used by such men to slaves I asked what I was to alight for To take the cursedest flogging you ever had in your life you d d black scoundrel But what am I to be flogged for Mr L I asked Not a word said he but 'light at once and take off your jacket I saw there was nothing else to be done and slipped off the horse on the opposite side from him Now take off your shirt cried he and as I demurred at this he lifted a stick he had in his hand to strike me but so suddenly and violently that he frightened the horse which broke away from him and ran home I was thus left without means of escape to sustain the attacks of four men as well as I might In avoiding Mr L 's blow I had accidentally got into a corner of the fence where I could not be approached except in front The overseer called upon the negroes to seize me but they knowing something of my physical power were rather slow to obey At length they did their best and as they brought themselves within my reach I knocked them down successively and one of them trying to trip up my feet when he was down I gave him a kick with my heavy shoe which knocked out several of his front teeth and sent him groaning away Meanwhile the cowardly overseer was availing himself of every opportunity to hit me over the head with his stick which was not heavy enough to knock me down though it drew blood freely At length tired of the length of the affray he seized a stake six or seven feet long from the fence and struck at me with his whole strength In attempting to ward off the blow my right arm was broken and I was brought to the ground where repeated blows broke both my shoulder blades and made the blood gush from my mouth copiously The two blacks begged him not to murder me and he just left me as I was telling me to learn what it was to strike a white man The alarm had been raised at the house by seeing the horse come back without his rider and it was not long before assistance arrived to convey me home It may be supposed it was not done without some suffering on my part as besides my broken arm and the wounds on my head I could feel and hear the pieces of my shoulder blades grate against each other with every breath No physician or surgeon was called to dress my wounds and I never knew one to be called to a slave upon R 's estate on any occasion whatever and have no knowledge of such a thing being done on any estate in the neighborhood I was attended if it may be called attendance by my master's sister who had some reputation in such affairs and she splintered my arm and bound up my back as well as she knew how and nature did the rest It was five months before I could work at all and the first time I tried to plough a hard knock of the colter against a stone shattered my shoulder blades again and gave me even greater agony than at first I have been unable to raise my hands to my head from that day to this My master prosecuted Mr L for abusing and maiming his slave and when the case was tried before the magistrate he made a statement of the facts as I have here related them When Mr L was called upon to say why he should not be fined for the offence he simply stated without being put on oath that he had acted in self defence that I had assaulted him and that nothing had saved him from being killed on the spot by so stout a fellow but the fortunate circumstance that his three negroes were within call The result was that my master paid all the costs of court He had the satisfaction of calling Mr L a liar and scoundrel and afterwards of beating him in a very thorough manner for which he had also to pay a fine and costs My situation as overseer I retained together with the especial favor of my master who was not displeased either with saving the expense of a large salary for a white superintendent or with the superior crops I was able to raise for him I will not deny that I used his property more freely than he would have done himself in supplying his people with better food but if I cheated him in this way in small matters it was unequivocally for his own benefit in more important ones and I accounted with the strictest honesty for every dollar I received in the sale of the property entrusted to me Gradually the disposal of every thing raised on the farm the wheat oats hay fruit butter and whatever else there might be was confided to me as it was quite evident that I could and did sell for better prices than any one else he could employ and he was quite incompetent to attend to the business himself For many years I was his factotum and supplied him with all his means for all his purposes whether they were good or bad I had no reason to think highly of his moral character but it was my duty to be faithful to him in the position in which he placed me and I can boldly declare before God and man that I was so I forgave him the causeless blows and injuries he had inflicted on me in childhood and youth and was proud of the favor he now showed me and of the character and reputation I had earned by strenuous and persevering efforts When I was about twenty two years of age I married a very efficient and for a slave a very well taught girl belonging to a neighboring family reputed to be pious and kind whom I first met at the chapel I attended and during nearly forty years that have since elapsed I have had no reason to regret the connection but many to rejoice in it and be grateful for it She has borne me twelve children eight of whom survive and promise to be the comfort of my declining years Things remained in this condition for a considerable period my occupations being to superintend the farming operations and to sell the produce in the neighboring markets of Washington and Georgetown Many respectable people yet living there may possibly have some recollection of 'Siah or Si as they used to call me as their market man but if they have forgotten me I remember them with an honest satisfaction After passing his youth in the manner I have mentioned in a general way and which I do not wish more particularly to describe my master at the age of forty five or upwards married a young woman of eighteen who had some little property and more thrift Her economy was remarkable and was certainly no addition to the comfort of the establishment She had a younger brother Francis to whom R was appointed guardian and who used to complain not without reason I am confident of the meanness of the provision made for the household and he would often come to me with tears in his eyes to tell me he could not get enough to eat I made him my friend for life by sympathizing in his emotions and satisfying his appetite sharing with him the food I took care to provide for my own family After a time however continual dissipation was more than a match for domestic saving My master fell into difficulty and from difficulty into a lawsuit with a brother in law who charged him with dishonest mismanagement of property confided to him in trust The lawsuit was protracted enough to cause his ruin of itself He used every resource to stave off the inevitable result but at length saw no means of relief but removal to another State He often came to my cabin to pass the evening in lamentations over his misfortune in cursing his brother in law and in asking my advice and assistance The first time he ever intimated to me his ultimate project he said he was ruined that every thing was gone that there was but one resource and that depended upon me How can that be master said I in astonishment Before he would explain himself however he begged me to promise to do what he should propose well knowing from his past experience of my character that I should hold myself bound by such promise to do all that it implied if it were within the limits of possibility Solicited in this way with urgency and tears by the man whom I had so zealously served for twenty years and who now seemed absolutely dependent upon his slave impelled too by the fear which he skilfully awakened that the sheriff would seize every one who belonged to him and that all would be separated or perhaps sold to go to Georgia or Louisiana an object of perpetual dread to the slave of the more northern States I consented and promised faithfully to do all I could to save him from the fate impending over him He then told me I must take his slaves to his brother in Kentucky In vain I represented to him that I had never travelled a day's journey from his plantation and knew nothing of the way or the means of getting to Kentucky He insisted that such a smart fellow as I could travel anywhere he promised to give me all necessary instructions and urged that this was the only course by which he could be saved The result was that I agreed to undertake the enterprise certainly no light one for me as it could scarcely be considered for even an experienced manager There were eighteen negroes besides my wife two children and myself to transport nearly a thousand miles through a country I knew nothing about and in winter time for we started in the month of February My master proposed to follow me in a few months and establish himself in Kentucky He furnished me with a small sum of money and some provisions and I bought a one horse wagon to carry them and to give the women and children a lift now and then and the rest of us were to trudge on foot Fortunately for the success of the undertaking these people had been long under my direction and were devotedly attached to me for the many alleviations I had afforded to their miserable condition the comforts I had procured them and the consideration which I had always manifested for them Under these circumstances no difficulty arose from want of submission to my authority and none of any sort except that which I necessarily encountered from my ignorance of the country and my inexperience in such business On arriving at Wheeling I sold the horse and wagon and purchased a boat of sufficient size and floated down the river without further trouble or fatigue stopping every night to encamp I said I had no further trouble but there was one source of anxiety which I was compelled to encounter and a temptation I had to resist the strength of which others can appreciate as well as myself In passing along the State of Ohio we were frequently told that we were free if we chose to be so At Cincinnati especially the colored people gathered round us and urged us with much importunity to remain with them told us it was folly to go on and in short used all the arguments now so familiar to induce slaves to quit their masters My companions probably had little perception of the nature of the boon that was offered to them and were willing to do just as I told them without a wish to judge for themselves Not so with me From my earliest recollection freedom had been the object of my ambition a constant motive to exertion an ever present stimulus to gain and to save No other means of obtaining it however had occurred to me but purchasing myself of my master The idea of running away was not one that I had ever indulged I had a sentiment of honor on the subject or what I thought such which I would not have violated even for freedom and every cent which I had ever felt entitled to call my own had been treasured up for this great purpose till I had accumulated between thirty and forty dollars Now was offered to me an opportunity I had not anticipated I might liberate my family my companions and myself without the smallest risk and without injustice to any individual except one whom we had none of us any reason to love who had been guilty of cruelty and oppression to us all for many years and who had never shown the smallest symptom of sympathy with us or with any one in our condition But I need not make the exception There would have been no injustice to R himself it would have been a retribution which might be called righteous if I had availed myself of the opportunity thus thrust suddenly upon me But it was a punishment which it was not for me to inflict I had promised that man to take his property to Kentucky and deposit it with his brother and this and this only I resolved to do I left Cincinnati before night though I had intended to remain there and encamped with my entire party a few miles below the city What advantages I may have lost by thus throwing away an opportunity of obtaining freedom I know not but the perception of my own strength of character the feeling of integrity the sentiment of high honor I have experienced these advantages I do know and prize and would not lose them nor the recollection of having attained them for all that I can imagine to have resulted from an earlier release from bondage I have often had painful doubts as to the propriety of my carrying so many other individuals into slavery again and my consoling reflection has been that I acted as I thought at the time was best I arrived at Daviess county Kentucky about the middle of April and delivered myself and my companions to Mr Amos R the brother of my owner who had a large plantation with from eighty to one hundred negroes His house was situated about five miles south of the Ohio River and fifteen miles above the Yellow Banks on Big Blackford's Creek There I remained three years expecting my master to follow and employed meantime on the farm of which I had the general management in consequence of the recommendation for ability and honesty which I brought with me from Maryland The situation was in many respects more comfortable than that I had left The farm was larger and more fertile and there was a greater abundance of food which is of course one of the principal sources of the comfort of a slave debarred as he is from so many enjoyments which other men can obtain Sufficiency of food is a pretty important item in any man's account of life but is tenfold more so in that of the slave whose appetite is always stimulated by as much labor as he can perform and whose mind is little occupied by thought on subjects of deeper interest My post of superintendent gave me some advantages too of which I did not fail to avail myself particularly with regard to those religious privileges which since I first heard of Christ and Christianity had greatly occupied my mind In Kentucky the opportunities of attending on the preaching of whites as well as of blacks were more numerous and partly by attending them and the camp meetings which occurred from time to time and partly from studying carefully my own heart and observing the developments of character around me in all the stations of life which I could watch I became better acquainted with those religious feelings which are deeply implanted in the breast of every human being and learnt by practice how best to arouse them and keep them excited how to stir up the callous and indifferent and in general to produce some good religious impressions on the ignorant and thoughtless community by which I was surrounded No great amount of theological knowledge is requisite for the purpose If it had been it is manifest enough that preaching never could have been my vocation but I am persuaded that speaking from the fulness of a heart deeply impressed with its own sinfulness and imperfection and with the mercy of God in Christ Jesus my humble ministrations have not been entirely useless to those who have had less opportunity than myself to reflect upon these all important subjects It is certain that I could not refrain from the endeavor to do what I saw others doing in this field and I labored at once to improve myself and those about me in the cultivation of the harvests which ripen only in eternity I cannot but derive some satisfaction too from the proofs I have had that my services have been acceptable to those to whom they have been rendered In the course of the three years from to I availed myself of all the opportunities of improvement which occurred and was admitted as a preacher by a Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church In the spring of the year news arrived from my master that he was unable to induce his wife to accompany him to Kentucky and he must therefore remain where he was He sent out an agent to sell all his slaves but me and my family and to carry back the proceeds to him And now another of those heart rending scenes was to be witnessed which had impressed itself so deeply on my childish soul Husbands and wives parents and children were to be separated forever Affections which are as strong in the African as in the European were to be cruelly disregarded and the iron selfishness generated by the hateful institution was to be exhibited in its most odious and naked deformity I was exempted from a personal share in the dreadful calamity but I could not see without the deepest grief the agony which I recollected in my own mother and which was again brought before my eyes in the persons with whom I had been long associated nor could I refrain from the bitterest feeling of hatred of the system and those who sustain it What else indeed can be the feeling of the slave liable at every moment of his life to these frightful and unnecessary calamities which may be caused by the caprice of the abandoned or the supposed necessities of the better part of the slaveholders and inflicted upon him without sympathy or redress under the sanction of the laws which uphold the institution I lamented my agency in bringing the poor creatures hither if such was to be the end of the expedition but I could not reproach myself with having made their condition really worse nor with any thing but complying with the commands of a heartless master In the course of the summer of a Methodist preacher a white man of some reputation visited our neighborhood and I became acquainted with him He was soon interested in me and visited me frequently and one day talked to me in a confidential manner about my position He said I ought to be free that I had too much capacity to be confined to the limited and comparatively useless sphere of a slave and though said he I must not be known to have spoken to you on this subject yet if you will obtain Mr Amos's consent to go to see your old master in Maryland I will try and put you in a way by which I think you may succeed in buying yourself He said this to me more than once and as it was in harmony with all my aspirations and wishes was flattering to my self esteem and could be attended with no harm that I could foresee I soon resolved to make the attempt to get the necessary leave Somewhat to my surprise Master Amos made no objection but gave me a pass to go to Maryland and back with some remarks which showed his sense of the value of my services to him and his opinion that I had earned such a privilege if I desired it Furnished with this and with a letter of recommendation from my Methodist friend to a brother preacher in Cincinnati I started about the middle of September for the east By the aid of the good man to whom I had a letter I had an opportunity of preaching in two or three of the pulpits of Cincinnati when I took the opportunity of stating my purpose and was liberally aided in it by contributions made on the spot My friend also procured some subscriptions in the city so that in three or four days I left it with not less than one hundred and sixty dollars in my pocket The annual Methodist Conference was about to be held at Chillicothe to which my kind friend accompanied me and by his influence and exertions I succeeded well there also By his advice I then purchased a suit of respectable clothes and an excellent horse and travelled leisurely from town to town preaching as I went and wherever circumstances were favorable soliciting aid in my great object I succeeded so well that when I arrived at Montgomery county I was master of two hundred and seventy five dollars besides my horse and my clothes My master was surprised to see me dressed and mounted in so respectable a style and I must say my horse was a good one and my clothes better than Mr R 's and he was a little puzzled to understand why I was so long in reaching home for it was now Christmas and he had been informed that I had left Kentucky in September I gave him such an account of my preaching and getting the assistance of friends as while it was consistent with the truth and explained my appearance did not betray to him my principal purpose Amid expressions of an apparently cordial welcome I could discern plainly enough the look of displeasure that a slave should have got possession of such luxuries and he bantered me not a little in his coarse way upon my preaching and my being so speedily converted into a black gentleman He asked for my pass and saw that it was expressed so as to authorize my return to Kentucky He then handed it to his wife and desired her to put it into the desk The manoeuvre was cool but I resolved to manoeuvre too At night I was sent to such quarters as I had been accustomed to long enough the cabin used for a kitchen with its earth floor its filth and its numerous occupants but it was so different from my accommodations in the free States for the last three months and so incompatible with my nice wardrobe that I looked round me with a sensation of disgust that was new to me and instead of going to sleep I sat down and deliberated upon the best plan to adopt for my next proceedings I found my mother had died during my absence and every tie which had ever connected me with this place was broken Strangers were around me here the slaves being those Mrs R had brought to her husband and I had not a friend to consult but Master Frank the brother of R 's wife before mentioned who was now of age and had established himself in business in Washington To him I resolved to go and as soon as I thought it time to start I saddled my horse and rode up to the house It was early in the morning and my master had already gone to the tavern on his usual business but Mrs R came out to look at my horse and equipments Where are you going 'Siah was the natural question I replied I am going to Washington Mistress to see Mr Frank and I must take my pass with me if you please O everybody knows you here you won't need your pass But I can't go to Washington without it I may be met by some surly stranger who will stop me and plague me if he can't do any thing worse Well I'll get it for you she answered and glad was I to see her return with it in her hand and to have her give it to me while she little imagined its importance to my plan My reception by Master Frank was all I expected as kind and hearty as possible He was delighted at my appearance and I immediately told him all my plans and hopes He entered cordially into them with that sympathy which penetrates the heart of a slave as little accustomed as I had been to the exhibition of any such feeling on the part of a white man I found he had a thorough detestation of Mr R whom he charged with having defrauded him of a large proportion of his property which he had held as guardian though as he was still on terms with him he readily agreed to negotiate for my freedom and bring him to the most favorable bargain Accordingly in a few days he rode over to the house and had a long conversation with R on the subject of my emancipation He disclosed to him the facts that I had got some money and my pass and urged that I was a smart fellow who was bent upon getting his freedom and had served the family faithfully for many years that I had really paid for myself a hundred times over in the increased amount of produce I had raised by my skill and influence and that if he did not take care and accept a fair offer when I made it to him he would find some day that I had the means to do without his help and that he would see neither me nor my money that with my horse and my pass I was pretty independent of him already and he had better make up his mind to what was really inevitable and do it with a good grace By such arguments as these Mr Frank not only induced him to think of the thing but before long brought him to an actual bargain by which he agreed to give me my manumission papers for four hundred and fifty dollars of which three hundred and fifty dollars were to be in cash and the remainder in my note My money and my horse enabled me to pay the cash at once and thus my great hopes seemed in a fair way of being realized Some time was spent in the negotiations for this affair and it was not till the th of March that I received my manumission papers in due form of law I was prepared to start immediately on my return to Kentucky and on the th as I was getting ready in the morning for my journey my master accosted me in a very pleasant and friendly manner and entered into conversation with me about my plans He asked me what I was going to do with my freedom certificate whether I was going to show it if I were questioned on the road I told him yes that I supposed it was given to me for that very purpose Ah said he you do not understand the dangers to which you are exposed You may meet with some ruffian slave purchaser who will rob you of that piece of paper and destroy it You will then be thrown into prison and sold for your jail fees before any of your friends can know it Why should you show it at all You can go to Kentucky in perfect safety with your pass Let me enclose that valuable document for you under cover to my brother and nobody will dare to break a seal for that is a State prison matter and when you arrive in Kentucky you will have it all safe and sound This seemed most friendly advice and I felt very grateful for his kindness I accordingly saw him enclose my precious piece of paper in two or three envelopes seal it with three seals and direct it to his brother in Daviess County Kentucky in my care Leaving immediately for Wheeling to which place I was obliged to travel on foot I there took boat and in due time reached my destination I was arrested repeatedly on the way but by insisting always upon being carried before a magistrate I succeeded in escaping all serious impediments by means of my pass which was quite regular and could not be set aside by any responsible authority It so happened that the boat which took me down from Louisville landed me about dark and my walk of five miles brought me to the plantation at bed time I went directly to my own cabin where I found my wife and little ones well and of course we had a good deal to communicate to each other Letters had reached the great house as the master's was always called long before I had arrived telling them what I had been doing and the children of the family had been eager to communicate the great news to my wife how I had been preaching and raising money and making a bargain for my freedom It was not long before Charlotte began to tell me with much excitement what she had heard and to question me about how I had raised the money I had paid and how I expected to get the remainder of the thousand dollars I was to give for my freedom I could scarcely believe my ears but before telling her how the case exactly was I questioned her again and again as to what she had heard She persisted in repeating the same story as she had heard it from my master's letters and I began to perceive the trick that had been played upon me and to see the management by which Isaac R had contrived that the only evidence of my freedom should be kept from every eye but that of his brother Amos who was instructed to retain it till I had made up six hundred and fifty dollars the balance I was reported to have agreed to pay Indignation is a faint word to express my deep sense of such villainy I was without the means of setting myself right The only witness to the truth was my friend Frank who was a thousand miles off and I could neither write to him nor get any one else to do it Every man about me who could write was a slaveholder and what chance had I to be believed or to get evidence to the truth In this dilemma I resolved not to deliver the paper to Amos and told my wife I had not seen it since I was in Louisville It might be in my bag and perhaps it was lost but at all events I did not wish to see it again at present and if she should find it and put it in some place which I did not know it would be the best disposition of it In a few minutes she went out and I remained in ignorance where it was till circumstances presently to be mentioned rendered it necessary for me to have it again The next morning I went up to the house and showed myself to Mr Amos who welcomed me with apparent cordiality and who I have no doubt was really glad to see me as my time and labor were important to him We had a long conversation and after rallying me as his brother had done about my being turned fine gentleman he entered upon the subject of my freedom and told me what Isaac had written to him about the price I was to pay how much I had already made up c I found my wife was right He then asked me if I had not a paper for him I told him I certainly had received something for him of which I had taken the greatest care but that the last time I had seen it was at Louisville and that now it was not in my bag and I did not know what had become of it I could not conceive how it could be lost and yet I could not find it He expressed great concern and sent me back to the landing to see if it had been dropped on the way When the search proved in vain he told me that after all it was of no consequence for whenever I made up the money his brother would renew the paper But said he you have given too much for yourself Isaac has been too hard upon you and I don't see how you are going to get so much in Kentucky All this was very smooth and pleasant to a man who was in a frenzy of grief at the base and apparently irremediable trick that had been played upon him I consoled myself as well as I could and set about my work again with as quiet a mind as I could command resolved to trust in God and never despair Things went on as usual for about a year when one day Mr Amos told me that his brother kept writing to him about his want of money and intimated that perhaps I might be ready to pay another instalment of my price I told him I had nothing as he knew very well and that he never had said what he would allow me or whether he would allow me anything for my labor in his service That put an end to the conversation at the time for he did not like the idea of paying for the labor I had bestowed on his farm the care of his stock and of his people It was not long however before the subject was brought up again and he said Isaac was perpetually telling him he must have money and added that I must get ready to go to New Orleans with his son Amos a young man about twenty one years of age who was going down the river with a flat boat and was nearly ready to start in fact he was to leave the next day and I must go and take care of him and help him dispose of the cargo The intimation was enough Though it was not distinctly stated yet I well knew what was intended and my heart sunk within me at the near prospect of this fatal blight to all my long cherished hopes There was no alternative but death itself and I thought that there was hope as long as there was life and I would not despair even yet The expectation of my fate however produced the degree of misery nearest to that of despair and it is in vain for me to attempt to describe the wretchedness I experienced as I made ready to go on board the flat boat I had little preparation to make to be sure and there was but one thing that seemed to me important I asked my wife to sew up my manumission paper securely in a piece of cloth and to sew that again round my person I thought that having possession of it might be the means of saving me yet and I would not neglect any thing that offered the smallest chance of escape from the frightful servitude that threatened me My wife and children accompanied me to the landing where I bade them an adieu which might be for life and then stepped into the boat which I found manned by three white men who had been hired for the trip Mr Amos and myself were the only other persons on board The load consisted of beef cattle pigs poultry corn whiskey and other articles from the farm and from some of the neighboring estates which were to be sold as we dropped down the river wherever they could be disposed of to the greatest advantage It was a common trading voyage to New Orleans in which I was embarked the interest of which consisted not in the incidents that occurred not in storms or shipwreck or external disaster of any sort but in the storm of passions contending within me and the imminent risk of the shipwreck of my soul which was impending over me nearly the whole period of the voyage One circumstance only I will mention illustrating as other events of my life have often done the counsel of the Saviour He that will be chief among you let him be your servant We were of course all bound to take our trick at the helm in turn sometimes under direction of the captain and sometimes on our own responsibility as he could not be always awake In the daytime there was less difficulty than at night when it required some one who knew the river to avoid sand bars and snags and the captain was the only person on board who had this knowledge But whether by day or by night as I was the only negro on the boat I was made to stand at least three tricks to any other person's one so that from being much with the captain and frequently thrown upon my own exertions I learnt the art of steering and managing the boat far better than the rest I watched the manoeuvres necessary to shoot by a sawyer to land on a bank or avoid a snag or a steamboat in the rapid current of the Mississippi till I could do it as well as the captain After a while the captain had a disease of the eyes by which they became very much inflamed and swollen He was soon rendered totally blind and unable to perform his share of duty This disorder is not an infrequent consequence of exposure to the intense light of the sun doubled as it is by the reflection from the river I was the person who could best take his place and I was in fact master of the boat from that time till our arrival at New Orleans After the captain became blind we were obliged to lie by at night as none of the rest of us had been down the river before and it was necessary to keep watch all night to prevent depredations by the negroes on shore who used frequently to attack such boats as ours for the sake of the provisions on board As I paced backwards and forwards on the deck during my watch it may well be believed I revolved many a painful and passionate thought After all that I had done for Isaac and Amos R after all the regard they professed for me and the value they could not but put upon me such a return as this for my services such an evidence of their utter inattention to my claims upon them and the intense selfishness with which they were ready to sacrifice me at any moment to their supposed interest turned my blood to gall and wormwood and changed me from a lively and I will say a pleasant tempered fellow into a savage morose dangerous slave I was going not at all as a lamb to the slaughter but I felt myself becoming more ferocious every day and as we approached the place where this iniquity was to be consummated I became more and more agitated with an almost uncontrollable fury I had met on the passage with some of my Maryland acquaintance who had been sold off to this region and their haggard and wasted appearance told a piteous story of excessive labor and insufficient food I said to myself If this is to be my lot I cannot survive it long I am not so young as these men and if it has brought them to such a condition it will soon kill me I am to be taken by my masters and owners who ought to be my grateful friends to a place and a condition where my life is to be shortened as well as made more wretched Why should I not prevent this wrong if I can by shortening their lives or those of their agents in accomplishing such detestable injustice I can do the last easily enough They have no suspicion of me and they are at this moment under my control and in my power There are many ways in which I can despatch them and escape and I feel that I should be justified in availing myself of the first good opportunity These were not thoughts which just flitted across my mind's eye and then disappeared They fashioned themselves into shapes which grew larger and seemed firmer every time they presented themselves and at length my mind was made up to convert the phantom shadow into a positive reality I resolved to kill my four companions take what money there was in the boat then to scuttle the craft and escape to the north It was a poor plan may be and would very likely have failed but it was as well contrived under the circumstances as the plans of murderers usually are and blinded by passion and stung to madness as I was I could not see any difficulty about it One dark rainy night within a few days of New Orleans my hour seemed to have come I was alone on the deck Mr Amos and the hands were all asleep below and I crept down noiselessly got hold of an axe entered the cabin and looking by the aid of the dim light there for my victims my eye fell upon Master Amos who was nearest to me my hand slid along the axe handle I raised it to strike the fatal blow when suddenly the thought came to me What commit murder and you a Christian I had not called it murder before It was self defence it was preventing others from murdering me it was justifiable it was even praiseworthy But now all at once the truth burst upon me that it was a crime I was going to kill a young man who had done nothing to injure me but obey commands which he could not resist I was about to lose the fruit of all my efforts at self improvement the character I had acquired and the peace of mind which had never deserted me All this came upon me instantly and with a distinctness which made me almost think I heard it whispered in my ear and I believe I even turned my head to listen I shrunk back laid down the axe crept up on deck again and thanked God as I have done every day since that I had not committed murder My feelings were still agitated but they were changed I was filled with shame and remorse for the design I had entertained and with the fear that my companions would detect it in my face or that a careless word would betray my guilty thoughts I remained on deck all night instead of rousing one of the men to relieve me and nothing brought composure to my mind but the solemn resolution I then made to resign myself to the will of God and take with thankfulness if I could but with submission at all events whatever he might decide should be my lot I reflected that if my life were reduced to a brief term I should have less to suffer and that it was better to die with a Christian's hope and a quiet conscience than to live with the incessant recollection of a crime that would destroy the value of life and under the weight of a secret that would crush out the satisfaction that might be expected from freedom and every other blessing It was long before I recovered my self control and serenity but I believe no one but those to whom I have told the story myself ever suspected me of having entertained such thoughts for a moment In a few days after this tremendous crisis we arrived in New Orleans and the little that remained of our cargo was soon sold the men were discharged and nothing was left but to dispose of me and break up the boat and then Mr Amos would take passage on a steamboat and go home There was no longer any disguise about the purpose of selling me Mr Amos acknowledged that such were his instructions and he set about fulfilling them Several planters came to the boat to look at me and I was sent of some hasty errand that they might see how I could run My points were canvassed as those of a horse would have been and doubtless some account of my human faculties was thrown into the discussion of the bargain that my value as a domestic animal might be enhanced Amos had talked with apparent kindness about getting me a good master who would employ me as a coachman or as a house servant but as time passed on I could discern no particular effort of the kind At length every thing was wound up but this single affair The boat was to be sold and I was to be sold the next day and Amos was to set off on his return at six o'clock in the afternoon I could not sleep that night which seemed long enough to me though it was one of the shortest in the year The slow way in which we had come down had brought us to the long days and the heat of June and everybody knows what the climate of New Orleans is at that time of the year A little before daylight master Amos awoke indisposed His stomach was disordered but he lay down again thinking it would pass off In a little while he was up again and felt more sick than before and it was soon evident that the river fever was upon him He became rapidly worse and by eight o'clock in the morning he was utterly prostrate his head was on my lap and he was begging me to help him to do something for him to save him The tables were turned He was now rather more dependent upon me than I had been upon him the day before He entreated me to despatch matters to sell the flat boat in which we two had been living by ourselves for some days and to get him and his trunk containing the proceeds of the trip on board the steamer as quick as possible and especially not to desert him so long as he lived nor to suffer his body if he died to be thrown into the river I attended to all his requests and by twelve o'clock that day he was in one of the cabins of the steamer appropriated to sick passengers All was done which could be done for the comfort and relief of any one in such a desperate condition But he was reduced to extremity He ceased to grow worse after a day or two and he must speedily have died if he had not but his strength was so entirely gone that he could neither speak nor move a limb and could only indicate his wish for a teaspoonful of gruel or something to moisten his throat by a feeble motion of his lips I nursed him carefully and constantly Nothing else could have saved his life It hung by a thread for a long time We were as much as twelve days in reaching home for the water was low at that season particularly in the Ohio river and when we arrived at our landing he was still unable to speak and could only be moved on a sheet or a litter Something of this sort was soon fixed up at the landing on which he could be carried to the house which was five miles off and I got a party of the slaves belonging to the estate to form relays for the purpose As we approached the house the surprise at seeing me back again and the perplexity to imagine what I was bringing along with such a party were extreme but the discovery was soon made which explained the strange appearance and the grief of father and mother and brothers and sisters made itself seen and heard Loud and long were the lamentations over poor Amos and when the family came a little to themselves great were the commendations bestowed upon me for my care of him and of the property We arrived home about the tenth of July but it was not till the middle of August that Amos was well enough to move out of his chamber though he had been convalescent all the while As soon as he could speak he told all I had done for him and said If I had sold him I should have died but it never seemed to occur to him or the rest of the family that they were under any the slightest obligation to me on that account I had done well as a slave and to have it acknowledged and to be praised for it was compensation enough for me My merits whatever they were instead of exciting sympathy or any feeling of attachment to me seemed only to enhance my money value to them This was not the view which I took of the case myself and as soon as Amos began to recover I began to meditate upon a plan of escape from the danger in which I constantly stood of a repetition of the attempt to sell me in the highest market Providence seemed to have interfered once to defeat the scheme but I could not expect such extraordinary circumstances to be repeated and I was bound to do every thing in my power to secure myself and my family from the wicked conspiracy of Isaac and Amos R against my life as well as against my natural rights in my own person and those which I had acquired under even the barbarous laws of slavery by the money I had paid for myself If Isaac would only have been honest enough to adhere to his own bargain I would have adhered to mine and paid him all I had promised But his attempt to kidnap me again after having pocketed three fourths of my market value absolved me from all obligation in my opinion to pay him any more or to continue in a position which exposed me to his machinations I determined to make my escape to Canada about which I had heard something as beyond the limits of the United States for notwithstanding there were free States in the Union I felt that I should be safer under an entirely foreign jurisdiction The slave States had their emissaries in the others and I feared that I might fall into their hands and need a stronger protection than might be afforded me by public opinion in the northern States at that time It was not without long thought on the subject that I devised a plan of escape but when I had fully made up my mind I communicated my intention to my wife who was too much terrified by the dangers of the attempt to do any thing at first but endeavor to dissuade me from it and try to make me contented with my condition as it was In vain I explained to her the liability we were in of being separated from our children as well as from each other and presented every argument which had weighed with my own mind and had at last decided me She had not gone through my trials and female timidity overcame her sense of the evils she had experienced I argued the matter with her at various times till I was satisfied that argument alone would not prevail and then I said to her very deliberately that though it was a cruel thing for me to part with her yet I would do it and take all the children with me but the youngest rather than run the risk of forcible separation from them all and of a much worse captivity besides which we were constantly exposed to here She wept and entreated but found I was resolute and after a whole night spent in talking over the matter I left her to go to my work for the day I had not gone far when I heard her voice calling me I waited till she came up to me and then finding me as determined as ever she said at last she would go with me It was an immense relief to my nerves and my tears flowed as fast as her's had done before I rode off with a heart a good deal lighter She was living at the time near the landing I have mentioned for the plantation extended the whole five miles from the house to the river and there were several different farms all of which I was overseeing and therefore riding about from one to another every day The oldest boy was at the house with Master Amos the rest were all with her Her consent was given on Thursday morning and on the night of the following Saturday I had decided to set out as it would then be several days before I should be missed and I should get a good start Some time previously I had got my wife to make me a large knapsack big enough to hold the two smallest children and I had arranged it that she should lead the second boy while the oldest was stout enough to go by himself and to help me carry the necessary food I used to pack the little ones on my back of an evening after I had got through my day's work and trot round the cabin with them and go some little distance from it in order to accustom both them and myself to the task before us At length the eventful night came I went up to the house to ask leave to take Tom home with me that he might have his clothes mended No objection was made and I bade Master Amos good night for the last time It was about the middle of September and by nine o'clock in the evening all was ready It was a dark moonless night and we got into the little skiff in which I had induced a fellow slave to take us across the river It was an agitating and solemn moment The good fellow who was rowing us over said this affair might end in his death but said he you will not be brought back alive will you Not if I can help it I answered And if you are overpowered and return he asked will you conceal my part of the business That I will so help me God I replied Then I am easy he answered and wish you success We landed on the Indiana shore and I began to feel that I was my own master But in what circumstances of fear and misery still We were to travel by night and rest by day in the woods and bushes We were thrown absolutely upon our own poor and small resources and were to rely on our own strength alone The population was not so numerous as now nor so well disposed to the slave We dared look to no one for help But my courage was equal to the occasion and we trudged on cautiously and steadily and as fast as the darkness and the feebleness of my wife and boys would allow It was nearly a fortnight before we reached Cincinnati and a day or two previous to getting there our provisions were used up and I had the misery to hear the cry of hunger and exhaustion from those I loved so dearly It was necessary to run the risk of exposure by day light upon the road so I sprung upon it boldly from our hiding place one morning and turned towards the south to prevent the suspicion of my going the other way I approached the first house I saw and asked if they would sell me a little bread and meat No they had nothing for black fellows At the next I succeeded better but had to make as good a bargain as I could and that was not very successful with a man who wanted to see how little he could give me for my quarter of a dollar As soon as I had succeeded in making a purchase I followed the road still towards the south till I got out of sight of the house and then darted into the woods again and returned northward just out of sight of the road The food which I bought such as it was put new life and strength into my wife and children when I got back to them again and we at length arrived safe at Cincinnati There we were kindly received and entertained for several days my wife and little ones were refreshed and then we were carried on our way thirty miles in a wagon We followed the same course as before of travelling by night and resting by day till we arrived at the Scioto where we had been told we should strike the military road of General Hull in the last war with Great Britain and might then safely travel by day We found the road accordingly by the large sycamore and elm which marked its beginning and entered upon it with fresh spirits early in the day Nobody had told us that it was cut through the wilderness and I had neglected to provide any food thinking we should soon come to some habitation where we could be supplied But we travelled on all day without seeing one and laid down at night hungry and weary enough I thought I heard the howling of wolves and the terror inspired by this and the exertions I used to keep them off by making as much noise as I could took away all power of sleeping till day light and rendered a little delay inevitable In the morning we were as hungry as ever but had nothing to relieve our appetites but a little piece of dried beef I divided some of this all round and then started for a second day's trip in the wilderness It was a hard trial and this day is a memorable one in my life The road was rough of course being neglected and the logs lying across it constantly the underbrush was somewhat cleared away and that was about all to mark the track As we went wearily on I was a little ahead of my wife and the boys when I heard them call to me and turning round saw that my wife had fallen over a log and was prostrate on the ground Mother's dying cried Tom and when I reached her it seemed really so She had fainted I did not know but it might be fatal and was half distracted with the fear and the uncertainty In a few minutes however she recovered sufficiently to take a few mouthfuls of the beef and this with a little rest revived her so much that she bravely set out once more We had not gone far and I suppose it was about three o'clock in the afternoon when we discerned some persons approaching us at no great distance We were instantly on the alert as we could hardly expect them to be friends The advance of a few paces showed me they were Indians with packs on their shoulders and they were so near that if they were hostile it would be useless to try to escape So I walked along boldly till we came close upon them They were bent down with their burdens and had not raised their eyes till now and when they did so and saw me coming towards them they looked at me in a frightened sort of way for a moment and then setting up a peculiar howl turned round and ran as fast as they could There were three or four of them and what they were afraid of I could not imagine unless they supposed I was the devil whom they had perhaps heard of as black But even then one would have thought my wife and children might have reassured them However there was no doubt they were well frightened and we heard their wild and prolonged howl as they ran for a mile or more My wife was alarmed too and thought they were merely running back to collect more of a party and then to come and murder us and she wanted to turn back I told her they were numerous enough to do that if they wanted to without help and that as for turning back I had had quite too much of the road behind us and that it would be a ridiculous thing that both parties should run away If they were disposed to run I would follow We did follow on and soon the noise was stopped and as we advanced we could discover Indians peeping at us from behind the trees and dodging out of our sight if they thought we were looking at them Presently we came upon their wigwams and saw a fine looking stately Indian with his arms folded waiting for us to approach He was apparently the chief and saluting us civilly he soon discovered that we were human beings and spoke to his young men who were scattered about and made them come in and give up their foolish fears And now curiosity seemed to prevail Each one wanted to touch the children who were shy as partridges with their long life in the woods and as they shrunk away and uttered a little cry of alarm the Indian would jump back too as if he thought they would bite him However a little while sufficed to make them understand what we were and whither we were going and what we needed and as little to set them about supplying our wants feeding us bountifully and giving us a comfortable wigwam for our night's rest The next day we resumed our march and found from the Indians that we were only about twenty five miles from the lake They sent some of their young men to point out the place where we were to turn off and parted from us with as much kindness as possible In passing over the part of Ohio near the lake where such an extensive plain is found we came to a spot overflowed by a stream across which the road passed I forded it first with the help of a sounding pole and then taking the children on my back first the two little ones and then the others one at a time and lastly my wife I succeeded in getting them all safely across where the ford was one hundred to one hundred and fifty yards wide and the deepest part perhaps four feet deep At this time the skin was worn from my back to an extent almost equal to the size of my knapsack One night more was passed in the woods and in the course of the next forenoon we came out upon the wide plain without trees which lies south and west of Sandusky city We saw the houses of the village and kept away from them for the present till I should have an opportunity to reconnoitre a little When about a mile from the lake I hid my companions in the bushes and pushed forward Before I had gone far I observed on the left on the opposite side from the town something which looked like a house between which and a vessel a number of men were passing and repassing with activity I promptly decided to approach them and as I drew near I was hailed by one of the number who asked me if I wanted to work I told him yes and it was scarcely a minute before I had hold of a bag of corn which like the rest I emptied into the hold of the vessel lying at anchor a few rods off I got into the line of laborers hurrying along the plank next to the only colored man I saw engaged and soon entered into conversation with him in the course of which I inquired of him where they were going the best route to Canada who was the captain and other particulars interesting to me and communicated to him where I came from and whither I wished to go He told the captain who called me one side and by his frank look and manner soon induced me to acknowledge my condition and purpose I found I had not mistaken him He sympathized with me at once most heartily and offered to take me and my family to Buffalo whither they were bound and where they might arrive the next evening if the favorable wind continued of which they were hurrying to take advantage Never did men work with a better will and soon two or three hundred bushels were thrown on board the hatches were fastened down the anchor raised and the sails hoisted The captain had agreed to send a boat for me after sundown rather than take me on board at the landing as there were Kentucky spies he said on the watch for slaves at Sandusky who might get a glimpse of me if I brought my party out of the bush by daylight I watched the vessel as she left her moorings with intense interest and began to fear that she would go without me after all she stretched off to so great a distance as it seemed to me before she rounded to At length however I saw her come up to the wind and lower a boat for the shore and in a few minutes my black friend and two sailors jumped out upon the beach They went with me immediately to bring my wife and children But what was my alarm when I came back to the place where I had left them to find they had gone For a moment my fears were overpowering but I soon discerned them in the fading twilight at no great distance My wife had been alarmed by my long absence and thought I must have been discovered by some of our watchful enemies and had given up all for lost Her fears were not removed by seeing me returning with three other men and she tried to hide herself It was not without difficulty that I satisfied her all was right for her agitation was so great that she could not at once understand what I said However this was soon over and the kindness of my companions facilitated the matter very much Before long we were all on the way to the boat and it did not require much time or labor to embark our luggage A short row brought us to the vessel and to my astonishment we were welcomed on board with three hearty cheers for the crew were as much pleased as the captain with the help they were giving us to escape A fine run brought us to Buffalo the next evening but it was too late to cross the river that night The next morning we dropped down to Black Rock and the friendly captain whose name I have gratefully remembered as Captain Burnham put us on board the ferry boat to Waterloo paid the passage money and gave me a dollar at parting He was a Scotchman and had done enough to win my enduring gratitude to prove himself a kind and generous man and to give me a pleasant association with his dialect and his country When I got on the Canada side on the morning of the th of October my first impulse was to throw myself on the ground and giving way to the riotous exultation of my feelings to execute sundry antics which excited the astonishment of those who were looking on A gentleman of the neighborhood Colonel Warren who happened to be present thought I was in a fit and as he inquired what was the matter with the poor fellow I jumped up and told him I was free O said he with a hearty laugh is that it I never knew freedom make a man roll in the sand before It is not much to be wondered at that my certainty of being free was not quite a sober one at the first moment and I hugged and kissed my wife and children all round with a vivacity which made them laugh as well as myself There was not much time to be lost though in frolic even at this extraordinary moment I was a stranger in a strange land and had to look about me at once for refuge and resource I found a lodging for the night and the next morning set about exploring the interior for the means of support I knew nothing about the country or the people but kept my eyes and ears open and made such inquiries as opportunity afforded I heard in the course of the day of a Mr Hibbard who lived some six or seven miles off and who was a rich man as riches were counted there with a large farm and several small tenements on it which he was in the habit of letting to his laborers To him I went immediately though the character given him by his neighbors was not by any means unexceptionably good But I thought he was not probably any worse than those I had been accustomed to serve and that I could get along with him if honest and faithful work would satisfy him In the afternoon I found him and soon struck a bargain with him for employment I asked him if there was any house where he would let me live He said yes and led the way to an old two story sort of shanty into the lower story of which the pigs had broken and had apparently made it their resting place for some time Still it was a house and I forthwith expelled the pigs and set about cleaning it for the occupancy of a better sort of tenants With the aid of hoe and shovel hot water and a mop I got the floor into a tolerable condition by midnight and only then did I rest from my labor The next day I brought the rest of the Hensons to my house and though there was nothing there but bare walls and floors we were all in a state of great delight and my old woman laughed and acknowledged that it was worth while and that it was better than a log cabin with an earth floor I begged some straw of Mr Hibbard and confining it by logs in the corners of the room I made beds of it three feet thick upon which we reposed luxuriously after our long fatigues Another trial awaited me which I had not anticipated In consequence of the great exposures we had gone through my wife and all the children fell sick and it was not without extreme peril that they escaped with their lives My employer soon found that my labor was of more value to him than that of those he was accustomed to hire and as I consequently gained his favor and his wife took quite a fancy to mine we soon procured some of the comforts of life while the necessaries of food and fuel were abundant I remained with Mr Hibbard three years sometimes working on shares and sometimes for wages and I managed in that time to procure some pigs a cow and a horse Thus my condition gradually improved and I felt that my toils and sacrifices for freedom had not been in vain Nor were my labors for the improvement of myself and others in more important things than food and clothing without effect It so happened that one of my Maryland friends arrived in this neighborhood and hearing of my being here inquired if I ever preached now and spread the reputation I had acquired elsewhere for my gifts in the pulpit I had said nothing myself and had not intended to say any thing of my having ever officiated in that way I went to meeting with others when I had an opportunity and enjoyed the quiet of the Sabbath when there was no assembly I would not refuse to labor in this field however when desired to do so and I hope it is no violation of modesty to state the fact that I was frequently called upon not by blacks alone but by all classes in my vicinity the comparatively educated as well as the lamentably ignorant to speak to them on their duty responsibility and immortality on their obligations to their Maker their Saviour and themselves It may nay I am aware it must seem strange to many that a man so ignorant as myself unable to read and having heard so little as I had of religion natural or revealed should be able to preach acceptably to persons who had enjoyed greater advantages than myself I can explain it only by reference to our Saviour's comparison of the kingdom of heaven to a plant which may spring from a seed no bigger than a mustard seed and may yet reach such a size that the birds of the air may take shelter therein Religion is not so much knowledge as wisdom and observation upon what passes without and reflection upon what passes within a man's heart will give him a larger growth in grace than is imagined by the devoted adherents of creeds or the confident followers of Christ who call him Lord Lord but do not the things which he says Mr Hibbard was good enough to give my eldest boy Tom two quarters' schooling to which the schoolmaster added more of his own kindness so that my boy learned to read fluently and well It was a great advantage not only to him but to me for I used to get him to read much to me in the Bible especially on Sunday mornings when I was going to preach and I could easily commit to memory a few verses or a from hearing him read it over One beautiful summer Sabbath I rose early and called him to come and read to me Where shall I read father Anywhere my son I answered for I knew not how to direct him He opened upon Psalm ciii Bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name and as he read this beautiful outpouring of gratitude which I now first heard my heart melted within me I recalled with all the rapidity of which thought is capable the whole current of my life and as I remembered the dangers and afflictions from which the Lord had delivered me and compared my present condition with what it had been not only my heart but my eyes overflowed and I could neither check nor conceal the emotion which overpowered me The words Bless the Lord O my soul with which the Psalm begins and ends were all I needed or could use to express the fulness of my thankful heart When he had finished Tom turned to me and asked Father who was David He had observed my excitement and added He writes pretty don't he and then repeated his question It was a question I was utterly unable to answer I had never heard of David but could not bear to acknowledge my ignorance to my own child So I answered evasively He was a man of God my son I suppose so said he but I want to know something more about him Where did he live What did he do As he went on questioning me I saw it was in vain to attempt to escape and so I told him frankly I did not know Why father said he can't you read This was a worse question than the other and if I had any pride in me at the moment it took it all out of me pretty quick It was a direct question and must have a direct answer so I told him at once I could not Why not said he Because I never had an opportunity to learn nor anybody to teach me Well you can learn now father No my son I am too old and have not time enough I must work all day or you would not have enough to eat Then you might do it at night But still there is nobody to teach me I can't afford to pay anybody for it and of course no one can do it for nothing Why father I'll teach you I can do it I know And then you'll know so much more that you can talk better and preach better The little fellow was so earnest there was no resisting him but it is hard to describe the conflicting feelings within me at such a proposition from such a quarter I was delighted with the conviction that my children would have advantages I had never enjoyed but it was no slight mortification to think of being instructed by a child of twelve years old Yet ambition and a true desire to learn for the good it would do my own mind conquered the shame and I agreed to try But I did not reach this state of mind instantly I was greatly moved by the conversation I had had with Tom so much so that I could not undertake to preach that day The congregation were disappointed and I passed the Sunday in solitary reflection in the woods I was too much engrossed with the multitude of my thoughts within me to return home to dinner and spent the whole day in secret meditation and prayer trying to compose myself and ascertain my true position It was not difficult to see that my predicament was one of profound ignorance and that I ought to use every opportunity of enlightening it I began to take lessons of Tom therefore immediately and followed it up every evening by the light of a pine knot or some hickory bark which was the only light I could afford Weeks passed and my progress was so slow that poor Tom was almost discouraged and used to drop asleep sometimes and whine a little over my dulness and talk to me very much as a schoolmaster talks to a stupid boy till I began to be afraid that my age my want of practice in looking at such little scratches the daily fatigue and the dim light would be effectual preventives of my ever acquiring the art of reading But Tom's perseverance and mine conquered at last and in the course of the winter I did really learn to read a little It was and has been ever since a great comfort to me to have made this acquisition though it has made me comprehend better the terrible abyss of ignorance in which I had been plunged all my previous life It made me also feel more deeply and bitterly the oppression under which I had toiled and groaned but the crushing and cruel nature of which I had not appreciated till I found out in some slight degree from what I had been debarred At the same time it made me more anxious than before to do something for the rescue and the elevation of those who were suffering the same evils I had endured and who did not know how degraded and ignorant they really were After about three years had passed I improved my condition again by taking service with a gentleman by the name of Riseley whose residence was only a few miles distant and who was a man of more elevation of mind than Mr Hibbard and of superior abilities At his place I began to reflect more and more upon the circumstances of the blacks who were already somewhat numerous in this region I was not the only one who had escaped from the States and had settled on the first spot in Canada which they had reached Several hundreds of colored persons were in the neighborhood and in the first joy of their deliverance were going on in a way which I could see led to little or no progress in improvement They were content to have the proceeds of their labor at their own command and had not the ambition for or the perception of what was within their easy reach if they did but know it They were generally working for hire upon the lands of others and had not yet dreamed of becoming independent proprietors themselves It soon became my great object to awaken them to a sense of the advantages which offered themselves to their grasp and Mr Riseley seeing clearly the justness of my views and willing to co perate with me in the attempt to make them generally known among the blacks permitted me to call meetings at his house of those who were known to be among the most intelligent and successful of our class At these meetings we considered and discussed the subject till we were all of one mind and it was agreed among the ten or twelve of us who assembled at them that we would invest our earnings in land and undertake the task which though no light one certainly would yet soon reward us for our effort of settling upon wild lands which we could call our own and where every tree which we felled and every bushel of corn we raised would be for ourselves in other words where we could secure all the profits of our own labor The advantages of this course need not be dwelt upon in a country which is every day exemplifying it and has done so for two hundred years and more and has by this very means acquired an indestructible character for energy enterprise and self reliance It was precisely the Yankee spirit which I wished to instil into my fellow slaves if possible and I was not deterred from the task by the perception of the immense contrast in all the habits and character generated by long ages of freedom and servitude activity and sloth independence and subjection My associates agreed with me and we resolved to select some spot among the many offered to our choice where we would colonize and raise our own crops eat our own bread and be in short our own masters I was deputed to explore the country and find a place to which I would be willing to migrate myself and they all said they would go with me whenever such a one should be found I set out accordingly in the autumn of and travelled on foot all over the extensive region between lakes Ontario Erie and Huron When I came to the territory east of Lake St Clair and Detroit River I was strongly impressed with its fertility its convenience and indeed its superiority for our purposes to any other spot I had seen I determined this should be the place and so reported on my return to my future companions They were wisely cautious however and sent me off again in the summer that I might see it at the opposite seasons of the year and be better able to judge of its advantages I found no reason to change my opinion but upon going further towards the head of Lake Erie I discovered an extensive tract of government land which for some years had been granted to a Mr McCormick upon certain conditions and which he had rented out to settlers upon such terms as he could obtain This land being already cleared offered some advantages for the immediate raising of crops which were not to be overlooked by persons whose resources were so limited as ours and we determined to go there first for a time and with the proceeds of what we could earn there to make our purchases in Dawn afterwards This plan was followed and some dozen or more of us settled upon these lands the following spring and accumulated something by the crops of wheat and tobacco we were able to raise I discovered before long that McCormick had not complied with the conditions of his grant and was not therefore entitled to the rent he exacted from settlers I was advised by Sir John Cockburn to whom I applied on the subject to appeal to the legislature for relief We did so and though McCormick was able by the aid of his friends to defeat us for one year yet we succeeded the next upon a second appeal and were freed from all rent thereafter so long as we remained Still this was not our own land The government though it demanded no rent might set up the land for sale at any time and then we should probably be driven off by wealthier purchasers with the entire loss of all our improvements and with no retreat provided It was manifest that it was altogether better for us to purchase before competition was invited and we kept this fully in mind during the time we staid here We remained in this position six or seven years and all this while the colored population was increasing rapidly around us and spreading very fast into the interior settlements and the large towns The immigration from the United States was incessant and some I am not unwilling to admit were brought hither with my knowledge and connivance I was glad to help such of my old friends as had the spirit to make the attempt to free themselves and I made more than one trip about this time to Maryland and Kentucky with the expectation in which I was not disappointed that some might be enabled to follow in my footsteps I knew the route pretty well and had much greater facilities for travelling than when I came out of that Egypt for the first time I did not find that our prosperity increased with our numbers The mere delight the slave took in his freedom rendered him at first contented with a lot far inferior to that which he might have attained Then his ignorance led him to make unprofitable bargains and he would often hire wild land on short terms and bind himself to clear a certain number of acres and by the time they were cleared and fitted for cultivation his lease was out and his landlord would come in and raise a splendid crop on the new land and the tenant would very likely start again on just such another bargain and be no better off at the end of ten years than he was at the beginning Another way in which they lost the profits of their labor was by raising nothing but tobacco the high price of which was very tempting and the cultivation of which was a monopoly in their hands as no white man understood it or could compete with them at all The consequence was however that they had nothing but tobacco to sell there was rather too much of it in the market and the price of wheat rose while their commodity was depressed and they lost all they should have saved in the profit they gave the trader for his corn and stores I saw the effect of these things so clearly that I could not help trying to make my friends and neighbors see it too and I set seriously about the business of lecturing upon the subject of crops wages and profits as if I had been brought up to it I insisted on the necessity of their raising their own crops saving their own wages and securing the profits of their own labor with such plain arguments as occurred to me and were as clear to their comprehension as to mine I did this very openly and frequently my audience consisted in part of the very traders whose inordinate profits upon individuals I was trying to diminish but whose balance of profit would not be ultimately lessened because they would have so many more persons to trade with who would be able to pay them a reasonable advance in cash or its equivalent on all their purchases The purse is a tender part of the system but I handled it so gently that the sensible portion of my natural opponents were not I believe offended while those whom I wished to benefit saw for the most part the propriety of my advice and took it At least there are now great numbers of settlers in this region of Canada who own their farms and are training up their children in true independence and giving them a good elementary education who had not taken a single step towards such a result before I began to talk to them I said none of the respectable traders were offended with me but one man had the folly to arrest me for a small debt under the pretence that I was about to leave the country when I was only about to Detroit for a few days in the spring leaving my crops on the ground and all my family at home but one little girl who was to go to school for a few weeks It was so absurd however that I was soon released by some of my friends of whom I had many among the whites as well as the blacks While I remained at Colchester I became acquainted with a Congregational missionary from Massachusetts by the name of Hiram Wilson who took an interest in our people and was disposed to do what he could to promote the cause of improvement which I had so much at heart He co perated with me in many efforts and I have been associated with him from to the present time He has been a faithful friend and still continues his important labors of love in our behalf Among other things which he did for as then he wrote to a Quaker friend of his an Englishman by the name of James C Fuller residing at Skeneateles New York and endeavored to interest him in the welfare of our struggling population He succeeded so far that Mr Fuller who was going on a visit to England promised to do what he could among his friends there to induce them to aid us He came back with fifteen hundred dollars which had been subscribed for our benefit It was a great question how this sum which sounded vast to many of my brethren should be appropriated I had my own opinion pretty decidedly made up as to what it was best for us all to do with it But in order to come to a satisfactory conclusion the first thing to be done was to call a convention of delegates from every settlement of blacks that was within reach that all might see that whatever was decided on was sanctioned by the disinterested votes of those who were thought by their companions best able to judge what was expedient Mr Wilson and myself called such a convention therefore to meet in London Upper Canada and it was held in June I urged the appropriation of the money to the establishment of a manual labor school where our children could be taught those elements of knowledge which are usually the occupations of a grammar school and where the boys could be taught in addition the practice of some mechanic art and the girls could be instructed in those domestic arts which are the proper occupation and ornament of their sex Such an establishment would train up those who would afterwards instruct others and we should thus gradually become independent of the white man for our intellectual progress as we might be also for our physical prosperity It was the more necessary as in many districts owing to the insurmountable prejudices of the inhabitants the children of the blacks were not allowed to share the advantages of the common school There was some opposition to this plan in the convention but in the course of the discussion which continued for three days it appeared so obviously for the advantage of all to husband this donation so as to preserve it for a purpose of permanent utility that the proposal was at last unanimously adopted and a committee of three was appointed to select and purchase a site for the establishment Mr Wilson and myself were the active members of this committee and after traversing the country for several months we could find no place more suitable than that upon which I had had my eye for three or four years for a permanent settlement in the town of Dawn We therefore bought two hundred acres of fine rich land on the river Sydenham covered with a heavy growth of black walnut and white wood at four dollars the acre I had made a bargain for two hundred acres adjoining this lot on my own account and circumstances favored me so that the man of whom I purchased was glad to let me have them at a large discount from the price I had agreed to pay if I would give him cash for the balance I owed him I transferred a portion of the advantage of this bargain to the institution by selling to it one hundred acres more at the low price at which I obtained them and thus the school has three hundred acres of as fine land and as well situated land as Canada can show at a very moderate cost In I removed with my family to Dawn and as a considerable number of my friends are there about me and the school is permanently fixed there the future importance of this settlement seems to be decided There are many other settlements which are considerable and indeed the colored population is scattered over a territory which does not fall far short of three hundred miles in extent in each direction and probably numbers not less than twenty thousand persons in all We look to the school and the possession of landed property by individuals as two great means of the elevation of our oppressed and degraded race to a participation in the blessings as they have hitherto been permitted to share only the miseries and vices of civilization My efforts to aid them in every way in my power and to procure the aid of others for them have been constant I have made many journeys into New York Connecticut Massachusetts and Maine in all of which States I have found or made some friends to the cause and I hope some personal friends I have received many liberal gifts and experienced much kindness of treatment but I must be allowed to allude particularly to the donations received from Boston by which we have been enabled to erect a sawmill and thus to begin in good earnest the clearing of our lands and to secure a profitable return for the support of our school as among those which have been most welcome and valuable to us I could give here a great many particulars which would amuse and interest the reader if they did not instruct him But it is better not to indulge the inclination and I will conclude my narrative by simply recording my gratitude heartfelt and inexpressible to God and to many of my fellow men for the vast improvement in my condition both physical and mental for the great degree of comfort with which I am surrounded for the good I have been enabled to effect for the light which has risen upon me for the religious privileges I enjoy and the religious hopes I am permitted to cherish for the prospects opening to my children so different from what they might have been and finally for the cheering expectation of benefiting not only the present but many future generations of my race

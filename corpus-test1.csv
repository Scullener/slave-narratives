Arron,THE LIGHT AND THE TRUTH OF SLAVERY 'S HISTORY Reader here is the picture of the poor way-faring degraded There is clear evidence in the life and history of that he has been a slave cannot read a word There are very few full blooded blacks at the South that can read a word says Now reader wants you to buy this book I don't want you to buy it merely to read it through I want you to buy it and I want you to read it not for to lay it up in your head but to lay it up in your heart and then you will remember the poor way-faring Bondman The two-thirds of this little book was made up by the poor way-faring degraded The Bible says faith without works is a dead article has a great knowledge of the Bible but cannot read a word One mouth and one back to two hands is the law That the hand of his Maker has stamped upon man But slavery lays on God's image her paw And fixes him out on a different plan Two mouths and two backs to two hands she creates And the consequence is as she might have expected Let the hands do the best upon all her estates The mouths go half fed and the backs half protected Whose eyes stand out with fatness having more than heart could wish who will turn a deaf ear to their own flesh when it passes along and do walk like Priests and Levites clear and no relief provide God in his anger down on you looks A dreadful damning sin The men that go to Congress are men of good talents and principles yet all the horrors and butcheries of slavery they sanction thinks they are as destitute of moral principles as a horse Now God Almighty has spared us to see almost another new year through a great deal of sorrow and tribulation but yet he has spared our unworthy bodies so far and has not sunk us as Mr Miller has prophesied but we ought not to make our boast about it for it may not be too late yet because we do not know when the Lord will break out in judgment against us when we are living in so much sin and iniquity when dangers stand thick through all the land to push us to the tomb and we would go to the tomb if it was not for a merciful God He is slow to anger and abundant in mercy he commands us to touch not and handle not unclean things but come out from among the wicked and dwell among the righteous Do we do this but thinks not In our free and independent country where God's holy word is scattered throughout the United States there is almost three million slaves and about one million of them the white brethren's sons and daughters Well now you all unite together and uphold the mother of abomination Now men who call yourselves christians be wise and consistent and do not go to the polls and vote for a man that will turn you right out of doors Now when you white friends was running Mr Harrison for President they made such a fuss that thought Mr Harrison was going to make milk and honey flow through the face of the earth which when he took his seat he did not live but a short time God Almighty thundered from the eternal heavens and sent for him and trusts he has gone right home to heaven and prays God that he may keep him low in the valley of humility that at the end of the warfare I may have grace to leap right home to heaven and I trust to hail Mr Harrison there When Tyler came upon the throne what did he do but turn men right out of office who had half a dozen little children crying for bread Now what more can you expect from a slave-holding man for you can expect nothing more and if you men would be consistent with your prayers and pray from the centre of your heart then God would hear and answer and bless your prayers and let the oppressed go free but you see you don't pray in faith believing that is the reason that you cannot see to vote for good honorable men Their heads is full of the knowledge of the Almighty and their hearts is shut up with sin and iniquity 's views on slavery connected with politics When struck in New Jersey it began to grow dark about two miles before I come to Elizabethtown it was very cold I traveled through a swamp about one quarter of a mile When I got into Elizabethtown I was covered with mud up to my knees and almost froze I fell into several houses and asked them if they would be good enough to let me warm me but none of them would be good enough I almost sunk in despair and I thought I would freeze I fell into a house where there was an old gentleman and I asked him if he would be good enough to let me come and warm myself he told me yes he would my heart leaped for joy because I was almost chilled through says he had two daughters and they were very fine women and one of them had lived in Missouri for four years her husband died and she became a widow It was a very cold windy night and I asked him if he would be good enough to let me lay down in the kitchen all night by the fire No you shant lay in the house he but you may go and lay in the barn And his daughter that had become a widow in Missouri she kept house for her father she gave a first rate of a supper and a pair of dry trowsers to put on and a good pair of dry socks to put on and two good blankets and a quilt and she slipped them to me out of the kitchen window she told me in the morning when I got up to fetch them down out of the hay loft and put them in the carriage I did so I came to the kitchen and she refreshed me with a first rate of a breakfast and I had long talk with her she told me after her husband died she went about twelve miles out of the city of St Louis and kept school for a planter that owned one hundred and six slaves She told me that he cut up with his female slaves more than he did with his wife she sometimes his poor wife was almost crazy and he tried to cut up the same capers with me but he missed of it and he pretended to be a member of the church too She told me that when the sinful capers was found out by every one of the free States she thought then slavery would be abolished and not before She told me she came home to her father's house as quick as she could get away What a blessed thing it is for any one when they meet with sorrow and afflictions to have a father's home to go to Now the poor slave when he is tied to the whipping post and whipped almost to death he has no father to protect him and no mother to protect him and no one to fly to but his Heavenly Father They have to bear patiently with their hard task masters and live humble and faithful to God and then at the end of the warfare God will richly crown them in heaven When I was travelling in Foxboro I fell in among Universalists and they entertained the way-faring and degraded very hospitably and treated me like a brother minister and all They wrote considerable for towards printing in my book and throwed in and helped me to some money towards getting it printed I staid seven days with them And I bid 'em good bye and wished the blessing of God upon 'em says he wonders there arn't a thousand Universalists to where there is one He wonders there arn't a thousand infidels in the world to where there is one because the white brethren believe in the true light and gospel and sentiments of the Holy Ghost and yet set a bad example for their white brethren to stumble over That is what makes me say it is a wonder there is not a thousand infidels and Universalists to where there is one Men again who live up to the moral law wont enslave their brethren says that no true hearted Christian will begin to hold his brother in bonds The bible says he that stealeth a man and selleth him shall surely be put to death If he is found in his hands that thief shall die If a man hateth his brother whom he has already seen how can he love God whom he has not seen God says in the eyes of man there is respect to persons but in his eyes there is no respect to persons Whenever a man is cleansed from his sin and iniquity he is a new formed creature in Christ Jesus Christ is in that white friend the hope of glory and he is in Christ and so therefore there is no respect to persons He will treat an African brother as well as a white brother He will not oppress him If he is a wolf clothed in sheep's clothing he will stand up and say it is right to enslave the African brother--But if he is a sincere godly man he will not stand up and say it is right When was in the middle of the town in Wrentham I fell among several anti-slavery families and they treated me very coldly much as ever I could do to get a place to sleep but the Lord opened the heart of a white brother who had not been living in the place more than six months who gave me a first rate bed to sleep in and first rate food to eat The next morning was a very pleasant one and I told him if I never saw him no more that I might have grace to meet him in heaven and bid him and his family good by I fell in with a young minister His wife was a short woman of dark hair and she made out to write part of a His wife entertained very hospitably she asked me if I would not have something to eat and I thanked her and told her no but I told her I would take a bite along with me and say she very well and so she gave me two or three crusts of bread and a couple of slices of mouldy meat which smelt And the minister was a very holy man and he chastised a couple of times about speaking the Lord's name in vain but is afraid he is a wolf clothed in sheep's clothing With all his holiness the crust of bread and couple slices of mouldy meat was good enough for me I trust that he may get to heaven and I may be shut out but he has got to shake off some of the sin connected with his holiness before he will see his father's face in heaven Beggars ought not to be choosers but did not go in there begging for victuals to eat I went there begging them to write a little for me being as I could not write a word myself and it is there they did write a little for me Being as his wife asked me to eat some I thought she might give me food good to eat not give me food no better than for a hog to eat and as poor and in poverty as I am I never would ask them to eat unless I gave them as good food as I eat We all ought to learn to be consistent with our holy grace for firmly believes that God is a Being that will not be mocked he is long suffering and abundant in mercy and he that endures unto the end he richly will crown in heaven but the hypocrite he will turn a deaf ear to and shut them out of his holy presence thinks if he ever gets to heaven he will hail a great many Universalists there--them that believe in the true light and gospel of God's holy word I am afraid a great many of them will have to take a leap in the dark Twelve miles before struck into Uxbridge I fell in with a Universalist did not learn his name he treated me as a brother but I never shall forget his form he did'nt and sorrowful did he promise to pity and shift for money from friend to friend He helped him to lodging and to victuals and in money He told of a quaker man who was a great abolitionist he lived in Uxbridge went to him and he took my letter and read it and then told me to go about my business says it did not astonish me the Quaker brethren is like one half of the Methodist brethren they are complete wolves clothed in sheep's clothing When was in Mendon the friendly people throwed in and helped me considerable towards getting my book printed When was in Blackstone there was a white gentleman asked me if I had saw -- -- brother-in-law who lately removed from Connecticut State and I told him that I had saw his wife but I had not seen her husband yet he told me that he pretended to be a great anti-slavery man he told me that when I saw him that he guessed he would give me twenty-five cents I went to his house Sunday morning about eleven o'clock and I told him I had got victuals enough to board myself I asked him if he would'nt be clever enough to keep there all night till Monday morning he told me no and he would'nt do it and found as much fault with as if I had been boarding with him six months thinks instead of being an anti-slavery man that he is a great rebel as ever trod the soil of New England country thinks if he had him in the South and he thought he could make one dollar on me that he would sell me as quick as lightning was a man born in the South 's parents have been dead this something like twenty-three years says that it was nothing but hard work and hard usage that killed them That gentleman in Millville told me there was plenty of work to be done there There were several told me there were two or three gentlemen in business there that were now broken up and there were as many as eight or nine men there told me business was very hard When a man's heart is shut up with sin and iniquity he generally always speaks what comes uppermost let it be a lie or the truth but the lie generally always comes first SLAVERY A SIN We believe slavery to be a sin--always every where and only sin Sin in itself apart from the occasional rigors incidental to its administration and from all those perils liabilities and positive inflictions to which its victims are continually exposed Sin is the nature of the act which created it and in the elements which constitute it Sin because it converts persons into things men into property God's image into merchandize Because it forbids men from using themselves for the advancement of their own well being and turns them into mere instruments to be used by others solely for the benefit of the users Because it constitutes one man the owner of the body soul and spirit of other men gives him power and permission to make his own pecuniary profit the great end of their being thus striking them out of existence as beings possessing rights and susceptibilities of happiness and forcing them to exist merely as appendages to his own existence in other words because slavery holds and uses men as mere means for which to accomplish ends of which end their own interests are not a part Thus annihilating the sacred and eternal distinction between a person and a thing a distinction proclaimed an axiom of all human consciousness a distinction created by God--crowned with glory and honor in the attributes intelligence morality accountability and immortality existence and commended to the homage of universal mind by the concurrent testimony of nature providence conscience and revelation by the blood of the atonement and the sanction of eternity authenticated by the seal of Deity and in its own nature effaceless and immutable This distinction slavery contemns disannuls and tramples under foot This is its fundamental element--its vital constituent principle that which makes it a sin in itself under whatever modification existing all the incidental effects of the system flow spontaneously from its fountain head The constant exposure of the slaves to outrage and the actual inflictions which they experience in innumerable forms all result legitimately from this principle assumed in the theory and embodied in the practice of slave-holding Ah me what wish can prosper or what prayer For merchants rich in cargoes of despair Who drive a loathsome traffic guage and span And buy the muscles and the bones of man Like Mary have you come early to the sepulchre seeking Jesus in the Tomb thinks that hundreds and thousands of poor creatures black and white die in that manner every year we never think to call upon our heavenly father only when afflictions fall at our heels then we'll call on our heavenly father God commands us to shoulder our cross to follow him through evil report as well as good There is a great many lives humble and faithful to God till sorrows and afflictions come against them then they will flee like deadly poisoned something like Judas and Peter they will deny that they ever knew God Let us all learn to be consistent not to deceive our brethren when we have the true love of God stamped in our unworthy hearts then we'll shoulder our cross and follow Christ through evil report as well as good has seen a good many men and women in his travels the outward appearance appeared to to be Angels when stopped with them a while and come to have dealings with them their hearts were as destitute of the love of God as a Pitcher--complete wolves clothed in sheep's clothing Now reader I want you to remembeer the Bible says he that is thought much of in the eyes of men is despised in my eyes blessed is he who is despitefully used for my sake the Bible says that he who calls his brother a fool is in danger of hell-fire says that a true witness of Christ is persecuted on the right hand and on the left are brought as sheep before the slaughter When was in Milford two angels entertained him very hospitable made him welcome to stay over the Sabbath with them merely stopped awhile to ask their wives to write a little and they insisted on my staying over the Sabbath day and staid with them until Monday morning I was in the house about fifteen hours they began to find as much fault with me as if I had begged them to keep me a week How wrong thinks it is when a man will stand up and tell his brother one thing and have his heart another way a hollow heart is tenfold worse than an Arab an open enemy is less to be feared than a false friend These two angels that entertained on the Sabbath day were men who professed to be filled with gospel grace but like Adna and Anthony filled with filthy lucre Southern Arguments to stop the Mouths of Northern Guests A Northern man goes to the South sits at a table loaded from the slaves' unpaid toil who eats his corn bread in the sun marries a slave holder and then finds out that slavery is a divine institution and defends it in Southern and Northern pulpits religious newspapers--and for example consult memory or observation Rev Basil Manly a clerical man-seller recently preached in your churches in various parts of New England and the scores of clerical Baptist slave-holders that beset the North every Summer are invited to occupy your pulpits If you would enjoy the smiles of him who came to preach deliverance to the captives renounce all fellowship with the unfruitful works of slavery that you may in word and deed reprove them A poor slave being on his death bed begged of his master to give him his liberty before he died 'I want to die free massa' His master replied you are going to die soon what good will your liberty do 'O master I want to die free' He to the slave 'you are free' 'But do write it master I want to see it on paper' At his earnest request he wrote that he was free the slave took it in his trembling hand looked at it with a smile and exclaimed 'O how beautiful O how beautiful' and soon fell asleep in the arms of death If you read the election news you must have seen it of late years given under three heads thus--Dem Whig Scat and if you have watched this Scat you must have seen a wonderful degree of contagion and perseverance in it it keeps growing We first notice it in the election returns of the great presidential contest of when the two great parties organized with such enthusiasm that we could hardly have expected a single scattering vote Here is a table giving the progress of this singular political heresy for three years not fully but it will serve as an illustration Scat	Scat	Scat Maine New Hampshire Vermont Increased by a peculiar local cause Massachusetts Connecticut New York Pennsylvania Partial Ohio Illinois Michigan Total And so far as elections have taken place this year the increase is still more marked Here is a leaven widely diffused and actually at work which by the rules of arithmetic will leaven the whole lump of dough by the year What means this Scat column then and what is the right and wrong of the matter It means this though the partizan editors do not like to say it there is a Liberty Party organized on the principles of ' founded on the truth that 'Honesty is the best Policy' that Righteousness exalteth a nation--a sort of Good Samaritan Party which dont pass by on the other side The members of this party find there is one question in the politics of the country which must be settled right before any other question can be settled at all and till that great question is settled right our glorious revolution is incomplete and our national history unfit to be written They find that under the form of republicanism the country is really governed by a combination of about slave holders who hold on an average ten or eleven slaves each and contrive to wield the power and patronage of the Federal Government directing it this way and that way as they think it necessary to make their property in those slaves secure and profitable Now this property in human beings is immeasurably more tyrannous and oppressive than that usurpation against which our fathers took arms in ' Therefore so far from being allowed to be the governing interest in our great republic it ought to be abolished and put a stop to by universal acclamation This should be done if it is not supported by the Constitution and much more if it is For in the latter case we need to be relieved from the double disgrace of its existence and its constitutionality Merciful heavens are we under a constitution which attempts for it cannot do it to bind us to do worse than to pick pockets and steal horses Are we born into this green world and the great brotherhood of humanity bound neck and heels to necessity of doing the meanest of all mean actions viz to help petty tyrants put the shackles of slavery on the limbs of their victims If this be so it is our plain vocation as honest men and not rebels against our Maker to rebel against this constitutional provision at once and revolutionize the government under which we are born at least so far as to make it just Do our reverend clergy say no--do our learned and venerable judges say no the more need then that we should do our work instantly and like men Every ounce of moral and political not to say physical power should be exerted against a system so unjust that it cries to Heaven for vengeance and so fearfully established that it has poisoned the very fountains of gospel and law and this too notwithstanding any inferiority or degradation which may be asserted against the people suffering in slavery for the lower any man may be sunk in the scale of humanity the more need there is that he should be encourrged by justice--a strict regard to his unforfeited rights to rise Withholding due wages and compelling labor by force will not make a bad man better any more than it will make a black man white it will not make a man more patriotic or ready to fight for his country it may incline him to fight against it and if it should then we may wake up some morning and find of our countrymen taking arms against us from the hands of our invaders Judge Upshur a slave holding Secretary of the Navy foresees this and wants to tax the free labor of the country to build and support a Navy half as large as that of Great Britain to prevent it The Liberty party is not the enemy of the slave holders exactly the reverse The establishment of justice is the true interest of every human being all history backs this assertion The instant abolition of slavery would double the wealth of the slave States even reckoned in dollars and cents The Liberty Party is not the enemy of the Constitution Construed so as to enforce the restoration of fugitives escaped from slavery and the re-imposition of chains and observe it cannot be so construed without doing violence to its language the Constitution is an inconsistency a contradiction It is made to stab that very liberty which it was designed to shield It becomes a reproach a piece of hypocrisy an abomination Men will not so construe it or so obey it they hold to it and are ready to spend their treasure and their blood for it as an instrument ordained to establish justice to secure the blessing of liberty They fearlessly put it to every honest man can you commit that you know to be a most base and despisable crime to wit assist in delivering a poor hunted fugitive slave to the human hyenas who claim property in his sinews and then in the broad day light of justify yourself by pleading obedience to a constitution which bears on its forehead the inscription to establish justice to secure the blessing of Liberty No you can't That would be violating the spirit for the sake of obeying what is really not in the letter but what the slave-holders persuaded the framers that a compromise was a treachery to liberty and as much as that the framers confessed in the very act as the Madisonian papers clearly show No fine could atone for it and are we and our children bound to repeat it till the end of time Heaven forbid This is the position of the Liberty Party It goes to purify the Federal Government from the taint of supporting slavery and direct the whole constitutional energy towards its destruction and this was the doctrine of Washington who --There is only one proper and effectual mode by which it the abolition of slavery can be accomplished and that is by Legislative authority and this so far as my suffrage will go shall not be wanting Reader will you follow Washington or John C Calhoun who says--I regard slavery as the most safe and simple basis for free institutions in the world or will you subscribe to the pirate creed of Henry Clay who in his place in the U S Senate I know there is a visionary dogma which holds that negro slaves the dogma says men but the great compromiser did not quote it correctly cannot be the subject of property I shall not dwell long with this speculative abstraction That is property which the law declares to be property Two hundred years of Legislation have sanctioned and sanctified negro slaves as property And he Henry Clay declares that he is not for their emancipation immediate or remote We leave it to you reader whether the politics of the Liberty Party are not the only politics now worthy of an honest man's vote A war between the United States and any considerable maritime power would not be conducted at this day as it would have been even twenty years ago It would be a war of incursions aiming at revolution The first blow would be struck at us through our institutions meaning of course slavery that Ishmaelite among institutions No nation it is presumed would expect to be successful over us for any length of time in a fair contest of arms upon our own soil and no wise nation would attempt it A more promising expedient would be sought in arraying what are supposed to be the hostile elements of our social system against one another An enemy so disposed and free to land upon any part of our soil which might promise success to his enterprise would be armed with a fourfold power of annoyance We cannot safely stop short of half the naval force of the strongest maritime power in the world--This will cost at least four times as much as our whole government does now The Liberty party has a better way reconcile the hostile elements by establishing justice for the slaves treat them just as our fathers wished to be treated when they we hold these truths to be self-evident c No matter if the slaves were as bad as they are black and no sane man doubts that their hearts are at least as white as those of their oppressors it would be honester safer and cheaper to have them friends than to have them enemies We may take the side of their oppressors do their unrighteous bidding be their humble volunteer slaves and as our reward obtain their contempt drain our purse to support them in idle luxury and our veins to protect them against the just retributions of heaven But when we go down with them we and our children into the gulf of national perdition will it be a very great consolation to us that their skins were white and their ancestors anglo-saxon The Liberty party regards the fact of the subserviency of our Federal Government to the iniquity of slave holding a fact written on every of our history blazoned upon our escutcheon in the Missouri Compromise branded upon the national forehead in the Florida war as not only full of wrong but full of danger It makes the abolition of slavery the paramount vital interest of this nation an interest as much more important than banks currency tariffs and sub-treasuries as life itself is more important than the ruffles on our shirts or the blacking on our boots The Liberty party has awaked to see what all who are awake may see that while the Democratic and Whig parties suppose themselves to be engaged in settling important questions they are in reality only the puppets of a confederation of petty autocrats whose will is that nothing of that sort shall be settled whose only settled policy is to keep themselves rich by keeping free labor poor The Liberty party therefore deem it due to themselves as well as to humanity to use their political power to overthrow slavery TOUSSAINT L'OUVERT The friends of the enslaved are continually told that Africans are an inferior race If this were true it would be no good reason for enslaving them But it is not The world may safely be challenged to produce a noblier character than that of Toussaint the George Washington of St Domingo Calumny has striven to paint him a monster She has brought the printing presses of both continents to her aid but in vain Toussaint was born in slavery but his soul cannot be bound When his countrymen who had gained their liberty by the proclamation of Santhonax and Polvorre were in danger of losing it by the intrigues of former tyrants he was selected as their chief With reluctance he left the bosom of his family to which he was tenderly attached He gave union and a wise constitution to his countrymen By his bravery he repelled every foe Bonaparte it seems obtained possession of the sons of Toussaint and included them in the splendid bride which he sent to buy over the negro chief hoping by that detestable policy to make an easy conquest He was mistaken Toussaint met his boys with the heart of a father but immediately sent them back with a letter to Bonaparte the spirit of which will be shown by the following extracts CITIZEN CONSUL Your letter of the th Brumaire has been transmitted to me by Citizen Le Clerc your brother-in-law whom you have appointed Captain General of this Island a title not recognized by the Constitution of St Domingo The same message has restored two innocent children to the fond embraces of a doting father What a noble instance of European humanity But dear as those pledges are to me and painful as our separation is I will owe no obligations to my enemies and I therefore return them to the custody of their jailors You ask me do I desire consideration honors and fortune Most certainly I do but not of thy giving My consideration is placed in the respect of my countrymen my honors in their attachment my fortune in their disinterested fidelity Has this mean idea of personal agrandizement been held out in the hope that I would be induced thereby to betray the cause I have undertaken You should learn not to estimate the moral principle in other men by your own If the person who claims a right to that throne on which you are seated were to call on you to descend from it what would be your answer The power I possess has been as legitimately acquired as your own and naught but the decided voice of the people of St Domingo shall compel me to relinquish it It is not cemented by blood nor maintained by the artifices of European policy The ferocious men whose persecutions I have put stop to have confessed my clemency and I have pardoned the wretch whose dagger has been aimed at my life If I have removed from this Island certain turbulent spirits who strove to feed the flames of civil war their guilt has been first established before a competent tribunal and finally confessed by themselves Is there one of them who can say that he has been condemned unheard or untried And yet these monsters are to be brought back once more and aided by the bloodhounds of Cuba are to be uncoupled and allowed to hunt us down and devour us and this by men who dare to call themselves Christians Seven years previous to this Toussaint sent his sons then seven and nine years of age to Paris for education They were put under the care of a tutor named Coisnou Bonaparte used this man as a tool to prepare the boys for his purpose The tutor and his charge having been sent out with Leclerc Coisnou wrote from Cape Francois to Toussaint who was then at his country seat at Ennery saying The first Consul sends by me your two sons and certain important despatches Your sons will be with you to-morrow provided you will give me your word that in case of your not complying with the wishes of the First Consul they shall be safely returned to the Cape Toussaint gave his word and on the morrow the boys accompanied by Coisnou were with their fond parents Toussaint had now the choice of three things He might break his word and keep his sons he might comply with the wishes of Bonaparte and keep them or he might send them back He would neither break his word nor sell his country and therefore chose to send them back It was a proverb in St Domingo that Toussaint never broke his word When was traveling through Rhode Island State with George Benson a brother-in-law of Mr Garrison I put up at a tavern in Providence on Criston Hill a very respectable looking tavern The tavern keeper was a man with light hair and light skin and dressed up in first rate cloth When fell in with him I gave him my purse to take care of for me till morning with forty-eight dollars and seventy-five cents Out of the - he gave me the purse in the morning with dollars in it Besides I paid him twenty-five cents for one naked night's lodging And thinks that his heart is more homlier with sin and iniquity than what 's face is else he would'nt stole that money away from me willfully has seen in his travels them that would sooner rob from me than to help me to any And any one that will rob from will rob from the dead on the highway If they see a dead man laying in the wilderness with a thousand dollars in his pocket they will go and rob every cent away from him and then will go and say that he had not one copper in his pocket and will apply to the town to take him and bury him and the town will throw in their little mites and bury him after having so much money has been pretty much all through the State of Maine And has been in four towns where they have established Anti-slavery societies in his travels has been entertained and very hospitably with sincere Christians has talked in the Baptist church in the city of Portland to between seven and eight hundred people staid among the friendly people five days and during that time there was about fifty ladies and gentlemen told they would petition to Congress to pay taxes for the valuable negroes which they vote for every three head and sold them for fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars apiece such valuable property and yet don't pay one cent of tax When was in Dedham I fell in with a great anti-slavery man He keeps a store in Boston I did not learn his name He told me he wanted me a couple of days to dig potatoes for him There was a friend told that he called me an old odd simpleton I asked him what he would be willing to pay me for digging potatoes for him and he told me cents I told him I would work for him for cents if he would be willing to give me a place to sleep in the house and he told me he could not let me sleep in the house I asked him if he could not give me a pallet in the kitchen and he told me he could not but says he I will fix you a place in the barn He lived in a large house thinks he had room enough to give me a comfortable bed in the house but the trouble of it was he had not room enough in his heart to give me a place to sleep in his house thinks that he is like a great many anti-slavery men What anti-slavery he has got is lodged in the fore part of his skull his heart is as empty and destitute of anti-slavery as a pitcher is With all his great abolition he had not abolition enough to keep me in his house says he was good enough to do his work for him With all his anti-slavery says he is not one foot better than the Slaveholder in the South 's master was a very profane man and he has called me a damn'd rebel since I have been away and all the scoundrels he could think of says he shall not call him a damn fool not to my head Christians remember those in bonds as though you were bound with them is acquainted with ministers at the South that live in open adultery with colored women He has known ministers to tie colored men and women in cellars and whip them secretly until their backs were all dripping with blood thinks these white friends in the South that pretend to call themselves christians their hands and feet are stained with African blood which I am afraid in judgment the blood of the African's and their own children's blood that are enslaved thinks it will cry so heavy against them in judgment that it will sink their poor souls right into hell When was traveling in Princeton Mass he saw an old gentleman aged seventy years of age and he told him he knew he was from the south if he denied it ever so much and he asked him how he knew Why he told me he had been all through the south and he told him he firmly believed it was the prayers of the poor slaves that saved the south from being sunk Assist runaway slaves as you would wish to be assisted When was in Norwich Conn State I got to conversing with a yellow man with light hair and blue eyes and he told me he shipped on board a ship to go to South Carolina at the time of Nathaniel Turner's insurrection in the State of Virginia They then passed a law that no free man of color should land on the soil of South Carolina The constables and other officers came down to search the vessel to see if there were any free men of color to take up and put in the Calaboose This yellow man that had light hair and blue eyes he told the constable he was the colored man and the constable told him he was a damned Yankee and a liar and went down into the kitchen and saw a white man that had black hair and black eyes but he was a full blooded white man but he took him and put him in jail and kept him four days until the vessel was ready to sail and the white man swore he would never go to the south any more and he is now one of the greatest abolitionists in the state of Connecticut This fact can be proved by several white men in Norwich Happiness of Slaves But we are further told that slaves show by their actions that they are happy They sing laugh dance and make merry He is a shallow smatterer in human nature who does not understand this that mirth is often rather the effort of the mind to throw off trouble than the evidence of happiness It shows that a man wishes to be happy and is trying for it and is oftener the means of use to get it than the proof that it exists and as to singing why do prisoners sing in jails We have all heard them Does it prove solitary cells a paradise Do jail walls dingy light and solitude make men so happy that they sing for joy They sing to make pleasure for themselves not to give vent to it Their singing indicates a mind seeking amusement rather than one content with what it has--a mind conscious of a want and striving to satisfy it rather than one rejoicing in a full supply In illustration of this we insert a fact from Dr Channing of Boston I once passed a colored woman at work on a plantation who was singing apparently with animation and whose general manners would have led me to set her down as the happiest of the gang I to her your work seems pleasant to you She replied no massa Supposing that she referred to something particularly disagreeable in her immediate occupations I to her tell me then what part of your work is not pleasant She answered with emphasis--No part pleasant We forced to do it What has the Church to do with Slavery This depends upon the question whether slaveholding is a sin If it is the church of Christ has much to do with it If it is a sin at all it is a very great sin It almost shuts out the blessings of the gospel from a sixth part of our people It sends a corrupting influence over our whole nation Look at the immortal beings used as property as machines for making money The evil is too mighty to be seen at one glance Take a single slave--follow him through a life of hard labor without wages--see how the mind deprived of proper instructions shrinks and dwindles under the whip and the fetter See how his heart plundered of its holy affections is delivered over to brutality and corruption Go to the slave auction see human forms from infancy to grey hairs sold under the hammer See human souls bartered away for cash See families that God hath joined together separated never more to meet in this world Count if you can the groans fathom the bitter woes occasioned by these separations Sum up the thousands of these scenes that take place every year in the great domestic slave trade Go along with the chained drove from the Potomac to the Mississippi Then again glance your eye upon the varied shades and features of these unhappy slaves and see the sure evidence that white masters traffic in the souls and bodies of their own children Follow out the investigation into its details and you will begin to learn the greatness of the sin But go forward a little further Follow to the judgment bar of Christ all the souls that have been trained up in slavery Before the same bar will stand the American Church Will not this immense and woful havoc of souls which God created in his image and for whom Christ died be one of the first things to be inquired of by the judge Will not every individual christian be asked What hast thou done in this matter Now look and see what the church is doing See how in its largest denominations it embraces in its bosom slaveholders of all sorts How it abstains from reproof How in its most solemn assemblies slaveholders are mingled and sit down together at the table of the same Lord Christians at the north say they are opposed to slavery Count the number of ministers whom they have sent to the south who are now slaveholders Ask whether these slaveholding preachers are ever kept out of the pulpit when they visit the north How many ministers preach against slavery either at the south or the north Count the number of churches that bear a testimony against the sin by excluding slaveholders like other open sinners from their communion Now can any Christian man in his senses say after such an examination that the church is ready to answer to God for American Slavery No The first thing that church has to do with slavery is to repent and purify itself from the practice of it The second is to repent of the great sin of attempting to justify slavery from the scriptures The third is to repent and show toward the injured victims of slavery the spirit of him who came to open the prison door to unbind the captive and let the oppressed go free In a man who had resided three years in New York and bore a good character was taken out of bed at midnight and with his wife and son carried back into slavery by his own cousin In the same year a white man of Newbern N C carried his four slave children to New Orleans by way of New York having sold his wife their mother to a New Orleans trader three years before In the same year a man by the name of Phillips was taken up in New York by a speculator to whom he had been sold by his father and carried to Virginia as a slave Many honorable names might be mentioned in connection with such facts thinks there are a few white people here at the north that are worse than the slaveholders at the south They tie the blacks up at the south and whip them to death for little or nothing never knew them tied up and whipped to death for nothing--When was traveling in Connecticut State about two days before he got into Litchfield he felt like something was pushing him along and was so sensible of it that he laid down his bundle and looked back but could not see nothing but felt troubled in my mind I knowed that something was going to take place but did not know what it was When struck into Litchfield village I went to a tavern and there my sorrow commenced and there was eight or nine young men come up and felt of my head and there was a couple of old gentlemen come up and felt of my head and they told me I was no fool and that I had a good head Some of them wanted to know where I was from--some that I was from South Carolina but did not tell them where he was from but told him he would give him a eleven-penny bit if he would give him a place to sleep The tavern keeper told me that he would but like and Anthony he lit up stairs to bed for the sake of a few pieces of silver Judas betrayed his Heavenly Father Just so that rebel tried to sell my sinful body to the doctors but the Lord took care of same way the Lord delivered me out of the jaws of the Arabs just so he delivered me out of the jaws of that rebel was seventy miles away from home and never expected to see the face of his wife any more but the Lord did spare him to see the face of his wife once more Slavery second born of hell Child of sin and twin of death Who thy brood of woes can tell Drawing from the kindred breath Pride and hate and lust and crime Dark revenge and cruelty Woes that end not even with time Woes that curse eternity After I lived five years in Ohio my master heard of me and sent after me but the Lord opened the hearts of friendly white men and they helped me away to the North When I struck into the Vermont State for one week I could scarce step a step cause I had froze all my toes and feet with good shoes and stockings on too Little after that time I could pull all my toe nails out like rotten meat and has not got a natural toe nail on his feet my toes was all one winter healing up And when I come to realize what the Lord has brought me through I am really astonished he has kept my unworthy body from freezing to death and from starving to death I have been abused very bad but my master has never sent me to the whipping post but he has tied me up at home and has whipped me most dreadfully and so he has and he has debared me of going to meeting he has locked me up down cellar and has kept me there for whole days and has not suffered me to eat or drink a bite of any thing for nothing else under heaven only for going to meeting and serving my heavenly Father thinks that men put too much confidence in one another they do things in the eyes of poor feeble dying men they love the praise of their poor feeble dying men better than they do their Heavenly Father's And now when a man is made pure in Christ he is pure indeed and he does not do things in the eyes of men for to get the praise of men thinks there is nothing that man can make compared with the Almighty What man makes is like his poor feeble dying body it may last between sixty and seventy years and then it fades away But what God makes is pure and holy and it lasts forever Behold the sand in the rivers how pure it is behold the waters that God creates for as it flows through the earth how pure and good it is What is better when we are almost choked for drink than a pure drink of cold water it don't make us giddy or don't make us sick it only refreshes our unworthy bodies Behold the stone how everlasting it is it lasts forever does brick last forever Man makes brick of clay and to the dust of clay it returns again the same way God made us unto dust we return again 's views of poor feeble hollow hearted dying men A great many people tell me about this awful bad amalgamation business and they think when friendly people took me in and set me down to the table to eat with them and when their acquaintances come in to see them and see sitting up to the table eating with them it draws a dead damp on them it is like Adne and Anthony thinks if they would only look in the South where I come from it will be a complete ballot box for them they would put their hand right on their mouth and never utter another word about amalgamation or any thing else In the South white man wont suffer black man to look at white woman but they will go and force black woman and there aint eh or Anthony about it The very old devil has got his own foot right on the slave holders own neck and thinks the poor slave holder cannot see sin and folly until he is shut up among the damned in hell forever When falls in with sincere christian people they treat me like a brother but not as a slave and they let the way-faring eat when they eat and don't keep me waiting till they are done eating and then give me a crust of bread and a piece of old stale meat in the kitchen the way a great many ministers do in my travels says he should as live go to hear the devil preach as to hear some ministers because they preach one thing and practice another and don't begin to live up to their doctrine We should always practice what we preach to others for a man of words and not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds So says From Georgia's Southern mountains Potomac's either strand Where Carolina's fountains Roll down their golden sand From many a lovely river From many a sunny plain They call us to deliver Their

below Here is a short sentence of the wayfaring When was in Hallowell in the State of Maine a gentleman told him there were strong anti-slavery families lived in H but he could not get a soul good enough to take him in He thinks if it had been winter he should have frozen to death but providentially it was warm weather He laid himself down upon a harrow but the little red and black ants troubled him so he was obliged to seek shelter some where else He tarried the rest of the night in a privy When he arose he found a beautiful morning he walked four miles then asked a gentleman if he would give him some breakfast he told him he was drunk and foolish and ought to go to the Asylum He proceeded to two houses farther and there the Lord opened their hearts They provided him with a good breakfast which refreshed him much and they gave him food enough to last him two meals The man who refused to give me a morsel they told me was a rich man thinks he is rich in this world but is afraid he will be poor and miserable in the world to come He left God's blessing with them and proceeded on nine or ten miles when a gentleman opened his house for a meeting The hearers were very attentive they can hear other things as quick as a clap of thunder their heads are full of the knowledge of the Almighty but how does the heart stand as empty and as destitute of the love of God as a pitcher Now you do not hear of their sending many missionaries to Africa The ministers are afraid they can't get any more servants to steal God's holy word says that he that sells a man shall surely be put to death and if he is in his hands that thief shall die says that missionaries that are sent to Africa never will prosper and he believes that ministers sent to Africa are sent for mere sham and has told thousands so in his travels The last time went into Connecticut State I went to see Mr Ludlow about purchasing my freedom and when I got into the city of New Haven there I saw a man that called me by my name and was scared so that I could hardly speak A colored brother took me to Mr Boardman's house he advised me not to purchase my freedom that no free man of color could live there The first time I went to New Haven I was conversant with Mr Ludlow about purchasing my freedom He told me he would see about it the next time I went to New Haven he was gone from there he had moved to Poughkeepsie New York State so has give up purchasing his freedom and has tried to content himself here in the North God is merciful to us all and he bears with us and forbears with us A great many of the people are halted and blind so with sin and iniquity they can't see God's goodness nor his wrath until it sinks them right into hell and then they will see and cry for mercy but God does turn everlasting deaf ear to them they are shut up among the damned forever Behold his pouring wrath out upon the people in Gaudaloupe and destroyed from between so says It was about as great a place in the traffic of human souls as under the whole globe Behold his wrath pouring out upon the people upon the wide ocean and sinking thousands in the sea nothing only for their wickedness so says Behold thousands of men in the world getting mad with one another going into the field and cutting one another of by the thousands and leaving hundreds of widows throughout the world desolate with little children around them crying for bread to eat Wicked bad tyrants were sent to rule the government which do not know their right hand from their left so says has pressed out these poor men into battle has had them all cut

man cometh unto the Father but by me--John -- When was in Athol I fell into a house where there were several in the house and among them was a sea captain about years old He had been dealing on the African coast I had a long talk with him and he told me the blacks were better off in the United States with their masters than they were in Africa Says he when the King's daughter dies they will slay two or three hundred to honor the King says it is a wilful and malicious lie The bible says no drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of God Also cursed is he that puts the cup to his brother's lip Also no murderer shall inherit eternal life Cursed is he that imbues his hands in his brother's blood They carry liquor into Africa and that ain't bad enough so they carry guns and powder there also shot and balls and the sword make them drunk and then compel them to fight Whichever tribe conquers will bring to the whites those whom they conquer and they will buy them by giving in exchange ribbons beads red shirts and one foolish thing and another asked the above named captain who he is afraid is going down to hell with a bundle of sin of his back if he didn't think God would bless the nation ten-fold if they would carry bibles and hymn books there and send missionaries and teach them that there is a holy God above thinks that God would bless Africa ten-fold and England and America would be blessed ten-fold too Some says Where is the nation that has been treated as bad as the poor Africans Who inhabits the south part of Africa Something like two hundred miles of Africa is inhabited by the white men The natives are cut off and driven back And what ain't driven off are stolen away and brought here to America and the West India Islands Their children are scattered among the white folks and held in bonds It's true the Indians are cut off from their country and driven back but they ain't catched and made slaves of and the women taken away from them and forced by white men the way the poor Africans is The way-faring Corruption earth and worms Shall but refine this flesh Till my triumphant spirit comes To put it on afresh Arrayed in glorious grace Shall these vile bodies shine And every shape and every face Look heavenly and divine Father accept the praise Of these our humble songs Till tunes of nobler sound we raise With our immortal tongues This is one of 's Virginia hymns he requested me to put in 's views on freedom and slavery Industry diligence and proper improvement of time are important duties of the young In youth the habits of industry are most easily acquired and the motives to it are strongest both from ambition and from duty and the prospects which the beginning of life affords Industry is not only the instrument of improvements but the foundation of pleasure Nothing is so opposite to the enjoyment of life as the state of an indolent mind Those who are strangers to industry may possess but they cannot enjoy for it is labor alone which gives a relish to pleasure We should fly from idleness as the certain parent both of guilt and ruin We should never let it cross our path while young Obtain industry in youth and it will never lose its hold says our southern brethren were reared up in complete idleness They have blacks to wait upon them to feed them and carry them to bed when they are between and years old Reared up in complete idleness then when they are reared up they go to gambling and cockfighting 's old master and mistress owned eight slaves and among them was three females They had to take night about and sit up all night to fan their master and mistress to keep them cool after working and toiling all day says that if you females remember your brother in bonds as though you were bound with them and will try to do all that is in your power to deliver them from that sinful indolent life I long to see the day when the white people live at the South as they do at the North not debar the poor African who has to toil out under the hot boiling sun and depriving them of everything that is just and right in the sight of a holy God thinks according to the reading of the Bible that God foreknew everything God Almighty saw that Pharaoh was determined to keep the children of Israel in bondage God taught such a time that they should keep them in bondage and that time was four hundred years and no longer If it was right for the Egyptians to hold the Israelites in bonds the Lord would not have brought them out Did not the Lord say that he would bring out the Israelites and bring the Egyptians to judgment God sent Moses and to deliver them and they were something like twenty or thirty years about it and it seemed that Pharaoh was determined to hold the Israelites in bonds the devil made a complete fool of Pharaoh so that he was swallowed up in water and woke in hell Pharaoh he bound the chains tighter and tighter around the Israelites The poor wicked slaveholder that is living now upon the face of the earth does not know his right hand from his left in bringing the chains tighter and tighter upon the poor slave at the south and is afraid that they will not hearken to justice until the Lord sinks them in sin and folly in the same way he did the wicked Pharaoh God had a foreview of the white man holding the African in bonds according to the reading of the Bible because he says you may go and buy of the heathen and they shall serve you forever and they shall be inherited to your children forever that is if your hearts are wicked and bad enough to do so--but remember after death God will bring you into judgment We must take the bible as it reads and it is a bitter guide against slavery if it was not a bitter guide against slavery why does it say in so many different places thou shalt not hold thy fellow mortal in bondage The slaveholders can't see to read the bible because their hearts are shut up with sin and iniquity and is stained with the African's blood When every man is dipped in the blood of Christ he is a new creature in Christ Jesus then he can see to read God's holy word and he will not read it and say it is right to hold his fellow mortal in servitude and traffic in his own flesh and blood Any man blessed with moral principles will not stand up and justify slavery and say that it is right Now we just as well might say that it was right for God Almighty to send down his holy Son from above for the wicked Jews to put to death God Almighty sent his holy Son down from above to preach to the people to tell them the way to fly from iniquity and be saved in his holy kingdom but the Jews were very wicked and bad like the people now-a-days they took the holy Lamb and slayed him God Almighty blessed the Jews with the power and he blessed them with the strength but he did not bless them in the heart with that wicked bad deed Who was it blessed them with that wicked bad deed thinks it was the devil that blessed them with that wicked bad deed else they would not have taken that holy lamb from above and put him to death thinks all the Jews that condemned Christ is now numbered among the damned in hell and always will be there until the end of time All the horrors and iniquity of slavery has seen in the State of Maryland and in the State of Kentucky and in the State of old Virginia says they do not raise rice there they do not raise cotton there this all grows in South Carolina and Georgia says that in the last of December they fetch up sugar and molasses they fetch up rice and cotton and trade it off in old Virginia for little black boys and girls between and years old and take them down into South Carolina and Georgia and sell them and get the money for them and put the money in their pockets Poor mothers are robbed of their dear little children and there is not ethram nor anthema about it 's views upon half-hearted Christian people standing up in the eyes of their brethren and sisters and not only in their eyes but in the eyes of a holy God too and justifying slavery and saying it is right how did you feel and fare for about the first week after you left your master O good man after I and tother slave that come with me took start away from our master for more than one week I suffered dreadfully so I did cause I all the time did think master's overseers was close my heel behind to catch me and I liked most starved to death so I did--for after I got into Ohio State with nothing with me to eat and you know I was afraid to stop at the houses where folks was to beg so afraid some enemy would catch me you know and run me back to master which I dreaded that most like death itself so I did And dear man how I lived I don't know for as true as-you live I had to creep when it was dark to get where folks did keep their stuff for the hogs to eat and did eat the very swill so I did not as we read the Prodigal Son did in the Bible because he left his father's nice home but because I was going to get that freedom which God blessed me to get that freedom which you white folks have and don't think much about it Your white folks tell a good deal about this nation's liberty the fourth of July And folks tell me when the voters meet to choose the people's rulers to serve their master God in his fear and for the constitution liberties of every body in this big nation but I guess your white voters don't mean or else don't care much about the poor slaves because if they did I guess they would not vote to make the President of the nation out of slaveholders or some men just as bad as slaveholders if they don't hold slaves for so the folks tell me and I guess it's true When was traveling in Connecticut State I stopped at a tavern in Windsor along the Connecticut River it was pretty cool weather I asked the tavern-keeper if he would'nt be good enough to give me a comfortable straw bed to sleep in for twenty-five cents Hd told his customers did not like it when he took in a colored man I then asked him if he would'nt be good enough to give a pallet in the bar-room he would not do it and I had to come away I went about a quarter of a mile farther and stopped to a young lady's house She told me she would willingly take me in but her husband did not like colored people and he would only scold me if I took you in She told to go to the minister he was a good benevolent man and he would give me a good comfortable bed to sleep in I went as she told me to and asked him if he would be good enough to give me a place to lie down in his kitchen and he would not do it Then I asked him if he would not give me an old blanket and let me sleep in his barn--he told me he could not very well bid him good night and told him the Lord would provide somewhere for me to sleep to-night I went about a quarter of a mile further and the Lord opened the heart of a white widow lady and she took in I told her if she would give me a place to lie in the kitchen I would put my hand on my mouth and thank God I was very tired and weary--she told me I should not sleep in the kitchen But she gave me a candle and told me what chamber to sleep in and I went up stairs to bed--and Prince Edward never slept in a better bed--and she and her son made me welcome to stay over the Sabbath With all his Christianity he had not grace enough to keep one night in his barn says it did not astonish him none for thinks that two thirds of the ministers' heads are filled with the knowledge of the Almighty but their hearts are empty and destitute of the love of God as an empty pitcher They preach more for the money and for popularity than they do for the people's poor souls That is the reason why sin and iniquity so much abound in the land If these ministers were men after God's own heart slavery would not abound in the world as it does but when sorrow and affliction comes against them they will flee like lightning but they cannot preach unless you give them fifteen or sixteen hundred dollars a year then they will preach--for preaching free salvation to all mankind If they were men after God's own heart they would preach for two or three hundred and they will not rob the widow and the halt and the blind PIOUS SLAVEHOLDERS--BY ELIZUR WRIGHT I have no more disposition than I ever had to demonstrate how much men may dabble with dishonesty or defile themselves with oppression and yet be saved--how much men may vocally or silently consent with thieves and yet be honest--how much they may involve themselves with laws and customs worthy of devils and yet deserve sympathy and consolation at our hands as Christians There may be Christian pickpockets Christian horse thieves Christian swindlers for aught I know I am not profound on this argument But I think such Christians do no honor to a church much less to a pulpit January th was traveling through Assonet I stayed all night at the house of Mr Nichols and he entertained me very hospitably I left his house next day between three and four o'clock you all know the days are very short and cold here at the north When I left his house the wind blew very cold and night come upon me and I thought I should freeze I asked eight or nine families to entertain me but I could not get any of them to keep me and I traveled on and God opened the heart of a good Samaritan and she entertained and she entertained me like a brother and her husband was almost three thousand miles away from home and not a soul was in that house but her and four small children and yet she was not afraid to entertain the wayfaring It was a dreadful keen cold night but the Lord watched over all that dwelt under that roof and brought us all to behold the light of another beautiful morning and she refreshed my unworthy body with a first rate breakfast--fried beef steak and good light biscuit and she gave me a first rate cup of tea that struck through every nerve and that was not all she done for but she told her oldest son to go out and hitch up the horse and we got in and she toated me all the way to Fall River that is five miles she carried me--and she gave cents in money She was one white lady out of a thousand She took in and kept me from freezing to death and she gave me first rate victuals to refresh my unworthy body Her name I have forgotten but her face will always be in my presence forever She is the daughter of the Rev Mr Anderson of Assonet--he has been Pastor of the Church in Assonet for years He was a revolutioner has formerly been a slave in the south and has seen pretty hard times and also in the north and in the west has been through all the New England States and has told his sorrow and affliction in thirty-two churches besides in halls and school-houses and dwelling-houses These sorrows and afflictions can be proved by seventy thousand men which the poor slave has to undergo in getting away from the hard task-masters says if the white men were all like Ward Richards in West Bridgewater and Jesse Torrey in North Abington Mr Foster in New Hampshire State who was dragged out of the Church in Nashua Orson Murray in Vermont State who prints the Vermont Telegraph Mr Gay in Hubbardston Mr Bradford who preaches in the Congregationalist Church in Hubbardston Mr Garrison who was dragged through the streets of Boston with a rope round his neck Mr Hanning in Cadus in Ohio State Mr Stansbury in Lancaster Ohio Dr Caleb Swan of Easton there would not be a slave in the United States but they are not like these men thinks that God has got a crown richly laid up in heaven for these men who has suffered heavy persecution on the right hand and on the left because they have stood up for the rights and liberties of the poor African man who is good enough to stand up and fight for the country in time of trouble and who have been slain down by hundreds but are not good enough to enjoy their freedom under these free and independent colors These free and independent colors float at the Capitol says in this free and independent country there are almost three millions slaves kept A lash on the back is valued at cents in Virginia and Illinois The law which is common to both States runs thus-- In all cases where free persons are punished by fine servants shall be punished by whippingafter the rate of twenty lashes for every eight dollars so that no servant shall receive more than forty lashes at any one time--only dollars worth of whipping at one time The Slave Joseph Come Judah and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites And the rest agreed to it Then there passed by Midianite merchantmen slave traders and they lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver poor boy His father had sent him on a kind errand to his brothers and was waiting for him to return A Southern gentleman in the debate at Lane Seminary thus describes the punishment of the paddle A bricklayer a neighbor of ours owned a very smart young negro man who ran away but was caught When his master got him home he stripped him naked tied him up by his hands in plain sight and hearing of the academy and the public green so high that his feet could not touch the ground then tied them together and put a long board between his legs to keep him steady After preparing him in this way he took a paddle bored it full of holes and commenced beating him with it He continued it leisurely all day At night his flesh was literally pounded to jelly It was two weeks before he was able to walk No one took any notice of it No one thought any wrong was done The following instance occurred near Natchez See N Y Evangelist for Jan A planter purchased a notorious runaway He gave him to understand that he could elope if he chose probably in a tone which warned him of the consequences The negro took him at his word but was soon taken and flogged very severely His master then opened the gate and told him to go again he did so but was in a few days retaken His master flogged him if I recollect till he fainted and yoked him in the fence between rails during the day The wretched negro escaped a third time but was able to elude pursuit only for a few days This time his master beat him till his back was almost raw knocked out his eye teeth yoked him in the fence and poured spirits of turpentine over his bleeding wounds The poor negro fainted on account of the intensity of his sufferings My informant received his account from the planter The two following cases are communicated by Mr Birney of Kentucky Not very long ago in Lincoln county Kentucky a female slave was sold to a southern slaver under most afflicting circumstances She had at her breast an infant boy three months old The slaver did not want the child on any terms The master sold the mother and retained the child She was hurried away immediately to the depot at Louisville to be sent down the river to the southern market The last news my informant had of her was that she was lying sick in the most miserable condition her breasts having risen inflamed and bursted During the winter at Nashville a slaver was driving his train of fellow-beings down to the landing to put them on board a steam boat bound for New Orleans A mother among them having an infant of about ten months old to carry in her arms could not keep pace with the rest The slaver waited till she came up to where he was standing he snatched it from her arms and handing it over to a person who stood by made him a present of it The mother bereft in a single moment of her last comfort was driven on without delay to the boat On the side of the oppresser was power but she had no comforter A man I did not learn his name in Scott county Tennessee kept a room apart which no one entered but himself and slaves One poor man he kept in it two or three days going in often and whipping him No one of the family dared if they wished to go to his rescue His cries and groans were so dreadful that the third night a young lady living there got the key secretly and went to the room A most appalling sight presented itself to her view the floor covered with blood and pieces of flesh She released the almost murdered man he fled and had not been heard from The shrieks extorted by this cruel man were often heard on neighboring plantations at midnight day dawn and other times THE BLIND MOTHER I saw a mother in her arms Her infant child was sleeping The mother while her infant slept Her guardian watch is keeping Around its little tender form Her snow-white arm was flung And o'er its little infant head Her bending tresses hung Sleep sweetly on my darling babe My own my only child But as she spoke the infant woke And on its mother smiled But oh no friendly answering smile The mother's visage graced For she was blind and could not see The infant she embraced But now he lisped his mother's name And now the mother pressed Her darling much loved baby boy Unto her widowed breast But sudden anguish seized her mind Her voice was sweetly wild My God she cried but grant me sight One hour to see my child To look upon its cherub face And see its father's there But pardon if the wish be wrong A widow'd mother's prayer And as she spoke her anguish grew More loud and yet more wild And closer to her aching breast She clasped her orphan child We shall be over-run with them If Ghosts were flesh and blood and flew in flocks the spectres of beggary and crime conjured up by we shall be over-run with them would darken all our northern air This objection when waged against our measures implies the conviction that they will be successful When argued against emancipation it implies that slaves are kept where they are against their wills It implies also that those who make it would keep their slaves in their chains rather than run the risk of having here and there a colored neighbor If the objector were to see the slaveholder knocking off the chains throwing away the whip and giving wages to his laborers he must needs cry out stop stop if you pay your laborers and treat them well they will quit you and rush to the north Who makes this outcry An American who while he boasts that his country is an asylum for the oppressed of all nations would perpetuate the oppression and robbery of his own countrymen lest some of them should find an asylum in his own neighborhood But his objection is a bald prophecy based on no facts contradicted by history and human nature If slavery were abolished the slaves would choose to stay at the south as hired laborers rather than come to the north Reasons They are already there and the trouble expense distance to be traveled time necessary for journey c would forever dissuade the main body from migration to the north There is far more room for them in the slave-holding portions of the U S than in the non-slaveholding In the former there is one third more territory and one third less population than in the latter The climate of the South is congenial to them that of the North uncongenial There is far less prejudice against the colored man there than in the North They are remarkable for their local attachments This is one of their peculiarities every where wherever they are to be found their aversion to a change of residence especially to a distant removal is proverbial All travelers in Africa unite in this testimony Edward's History of the West Indies--Walsh's Sketches of Brazil--Matherson's Notices of Sumatra Dr Dickson's Mitigation of Slavery Sturge and Harvey's West Indies in Thome and Kimball's Six months in Antigua Barbadoes and Jamaica abound with testimony to this trait We insert from the latter work a few testimonies of ex-slave-holders in Antigua The negroes are not disposed to leave the estates on which they have lived unless they are forced away by bad treatment--H Armstrong Esq Nothing but bad treatment on the part of the planters has ever caused the negroes to leave the estates on which they were accustomed to live--S BOURNE ESQ The negroes are remarkably attached to their homes--JAMES HOWELL ESQ The negroes are peculiar for their attachment to their homes--S BARNARD ESQ Love of home is very remarkable in the negroes It is a passion with them--Dr DANIELS Member of Council An aged planter they have very strong local attachments They love their little hut and will endure almost any hardship before they will desert that spot and says he has formerly been a slave at the South is eye witness to it Messrs Thome and Kimball say Such are the sentiments of West India planters expressed in the majority of cases spontaneously and mostly in illustration of other statements We did not hear a word that implied an opposite sentiment One gentleman observed that it was a very common saying with the negroes Me nebber leave my bornin ground i e birth-place The slaves rarely run away from mild masters now When they become their own masters and are protected by just laws why should they leave their native region to roam among strangers in an uncongenial clime Slaves when emancipated in the South stay there unless driven out Farther he says the forces were daily increasing and they felt themselves so strong and secure that they had commenced several plantations on the fertile banks of the Apalachicola which would have yeilded them every article of sustenance can slaves take care of themselves and which would consequently in a short time have rendered their establishment quite formidable and highly injurious to the neighboring States Heard ye the wail that was borne on the breeze From the land of the south it was wafted Where cruel oppression reposeth at case And liberty's scions are blasted 'Twas the wail of the black man he longs to be free From the scourges of oppression that binds him And he weeps when he thinks of his home o'er the sea And the friends that he left behind him For once he was free in the land of his birth Till the white man o'er the ocean came sailing And tore him away from his home and his hearth While they turned a deaf ear to his wailing They bound him in chains and dragged him away And in a dark dungeon confined him Like a felon deprived of the light of the day With strong iron chains they did bind him They then hoisted their flag--'Twas the flag of the free And set sail for their home o'er the billows And talked with delight of the friends they should see At home 'neath their own native willows But alas for the black man no kind friends await Him to greet in the land of the stranger Oppression and slavery must now be his fate And no kind hand will shield him from danger And this in a land where the rich and the poor Proudly boast of their free institutions The scourge of the tyrant he must meekly endure Nor claim for his wrongs restitution America boast not thy freedom again Till thou hast crushed the foul head of the demon Till slavery no more shall exist but in name And thy banners wave o'er none but freemen was acquainted with a yellow man that lived in Virginia in the neighborhood where he lived and the first wife that this man took belonged to his master and he lived with her about six years her master then sold her and two children to a man who was going to Georgia he then swore that he never would take another woman that belonged to his master he then took a woman about eleven miles from where he lived and they had three children His master whipped him three times for going to see his wife and children and the last time he whipped him it was the cause of his death--he lived about a week afterwards and when his poor wife got the news she became crazy and died with grief in about a month and left three little children in the hands of the Arabs to be bought and sold and perhaps whipped to death as their parents were has known several instances beside where slaves have been tied up and whipped to death by their masters does not know his age correctly but supposes he was about or years of age when he left Virginia and in all his life-time in the State of Virginia he has never known of but one instance of a slave killing his master The slave was a man three-fourths white and his master whipped him severely for gambling and he took a knife and run his master through the heart and after he had killed his master his father-in-law shot the slave down without judge or jury This circumstance says run through the State of Virginia like lightning if it had been a white man that killed a black man there would not have been ethron or Anthony about it this circumstance took place in Virginia or years ago When was in Providence there was a white gentleman took me to a colored woman's house to stay over night and I had a long talk to her before I went to bed and she told me she was acquainted with a rich white gentleman who lived in Providence and she used to go and wash every Tuesday for that family and he did not enjoy good health and in the winter season he used to go to the south for his health The third winter he went he took a colored boy with him to wait upon him When he came home he did not bring the boy with him and when asked concerning the boy he the boy died at the south God spared him to see another winter and he went to the south again and took another colored boy with him and when he returned in the spring no boy came with him and when asked what had become of the boy he he had died and that the southern climate did not agree with the northern negroes A few months afterwards he was taken sick and the day before he died he called to his attendants to take away those colored boys take away those colored boys and the doctor and his friends thought it was the devil he imagined he saw About a week after he died the last colored boy he took to the South with him came home His parents were astonished and rejoiced to see him and asked why he did not return with the gentleman he went out with He the gentleman sold him His parents were astonished and indignant that a gentleman in whom they reposed so much confidence should have been guilty of such an inhuman act and had he been living he would have been punished to the full extent of the law thinks when the man died he went right to hell for the Bible says He that stealeth a man and selleth him shall surely be put to death if he is found in his hands that thief shall die When was in Braintree he talked there in the Baptist meeting house while in the house a gentleman came and shook hands with him and he was not an abolitionist but says he I pity the poor slave but one half of the abolitionists are so false I cannot take side with them he I am acquainted with a minister in Braintree who professed to be a warm advocate of antislavery and lectured in many of the neighboring towns on the subject He went to the south and married a woman who owns human beings He comes back and apologises for it and says slavery is not so bad as he formerly thought it was He has found out it is a money making business thinks he is like Lot and Abraham when they were traveling together they fell out about their herds of cattle and Abraham I pray thee let there be no strife between my herd and thy herd Lot lifted up his eyes and discovered all the plains of Sodom and Gomorrah and it was well watered and well grassed but the people were wicked before the eyes of man and before the eyes of the Almighty but Lot cared more for the good things of this world than for the company of gospel people Abraham was a man shod with gospel grace he was unmovable in the work of the Almighty and he did not go down there and dwell with those wicked people but directed his way among the righteous Our land of the south like Sodom and Gomorrah is blessed by nature with all that can add to the comfort of man But the institution of slavery pollutes the moral and religious character and those who live in the north who go down to dwell with them are but too often corrupted and made partakers in the gain of their unworthy traffic and all their correct ideas of the rights of our fellow beings disappear before the love of the root of all evil When was in Bellingham I fell in with a white gentleman who appeared to be interested and wanted to have me talk And he come let us go to the house of the Baptist minister I went with him to the house of the minister and had a talk with him And was very degraded in the minister's eyes with all his Christianity And the gentleman who accompanied me insisted on my lecturing He thought I had not sense enough to tell what I had seen all the days of my life concerning slavery He gave out notice however for me to lecture but took good care to prevent my lecturing in the meeting house but consented that I should hold forth in the school house For I should be laughed at and made game of by a parcel of loafers who would gather around has lectured in several meeting-houses among which may be named one in Newburyport and one in New Bedford and in several other places to large audiences thought if he was not good enough to lecture in the meeting house he would not lecture at all This clergyman like a great many others pretend to remember his brother in bonds as bound with them when he does not remember his brother in bonds as bound with them In 's travels he falls among ministers who will entertain him and entertain him very hospitably that is if I will stop and attend meeting and hear them preach And then if I am laughed at and made game of what do they care But when asks them to get up a meeting for him that draws a damper on their feelings I do not know what they are afraid of except that degraded as I am I may throw some light before the people so that their congregations may be broken up so that they will not have fifteen or sixteen hundred dollars to put into their pockets yearly on which to live in fine style while their poor brethren at the south are in the worst of bondage thinks they preach more for money than for the people's poor souls Haste makes waste and waste makes want Let us be certain that we have got the mote out of both our own eyes and then we can see to pick it out of our brother's eye Whenever a man is born of God then he is a new creature in Christ Jesus Christ has in that white framed a hope of glory and he is in Christ and therefore they are as one God will not bless and convert our souls from sin and iniquity unknown to us When God blesses and converts our unworthy souls we have the witness abide within Now brethren and sisters let us be wise and consistent let us remember the sin and iniquity that abounds in our land When our brethren come to us to get assistance for the foreign mission we will have our eyes open then we can tell them with a clear conscience of the horrors and evil and iniquity that abound in our land Behold the horrors and sin and iniquity of slavery Whenever all of our hearts are cleansed from sin and iniquity then we can see the horrors and evils of slavery and every wicked bad sin that abounds in our gospel and christianized country 's views on the state of things Old Beelzebub the father of sin and iniquity he tempted me till I like to loose my soul in iniquity but blessed Michael helped me out of my distress and armed me with the sword and shield to march for Canaan's land Sweet fields arrayed in living green and rivers of delight no chilling winds nor poisonous breath can reach that happy shore glittering crowns and glaring swords will there our armies be We'll sing and shout forevermore around our father's throne Here is a short sentence of the way-faring Reader here is a short sentence from poor Nat Turner who suffered almost everything in the swamps for one year at Northampton finally he was taken and hung this took place about fifteen years ago Human flesh bought and sold and chained together rank and file the mastiff is kept to hunt human souls and this is all done over God's holy word We have a great many meetings in the southern countries what good does it do We are commanded to watch and pray and keep old Lucifer under our feet whenever any one is pure in the blood of Christ they do this The Christians in the south instead of keeping Lucifer right under their feet they let Lucifer have his foot right on their necks and by and by they'll fall and great will be their fall for they will fall to rise no more This is what the wayfaring requested me to write for him When I was in Ohio about miles from Chillicothe and Ben pitched a tent along the Sciota river and there we remained for four days goes and gets a pot that they keep in the barn to grease the wagons and takes it to my little tent and cleans it and then goes and gets raw potato parings out of the swill and cooks them One day went and got an old shank bone and cooked it It was a great place for hunting went out to gather some chips early in the morning a hunter came very near shooting through the head we were obliged to leave that spot as it was dangerous for us to tarry there We didn't put up quarters any where till we reached Lancaster the way we went was one hundred miles After I was in Lancaster years I got to conversing with Mr Stansbery he told that he had traveled all along the Sciota river and I told him about my little tent I had built along the Sciota river and he told me that he saw the same tent and thinks it is there to this day Some days after I left my master I thought I heard some one following me It was in a woody swampy piece of land I turned my shoes hind side before to make them think I was going the other way and went about two miles in the swamp and thinks the Lord looked down upon me and put wisdom in my unworthy head On the th of May was traveling through Spencer in Mass he fell into the house of ---- was hungry tired and weary and asked Mr ---- for leave to lie down upon his kitchen floor and understood him yes He went in and saw his little daughter whom he asked to lend him a teapot to make himself some tea Her mother came and looked cross and savage at him and asked what he wanted He replied I want to make a little tea She refused him and liberty to lie upon the floor and bid him be off a black rascal He went on but God opened the heart of a good Samaritan who would not allow him to make use of his own but gave him of her tea and gave him a bed to rest his unworthy body which the other and his wife had not grace enough in their heart to do DEUT -- At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release And this is the manner of the release every creditor that lendeth aught unto his neighbor shall release it he shall not exact it of his neighbor or of his brother because it is called the Lord's release Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release save when there shall be no poor among you for the Lord shall greatly bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe to do all these commandments which I commanded thee this day For the Lord thy God blesseth thee as he promised thee and thou shalt lend unto many nations but thou shalt not borrow and thou shalt reign over many nations but they shall not reign over thee If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee thou shalt not harden thine heart nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart saying the seventh year the year of release is at hand and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother and thou givest him naught and he cry unto the Lord against thee and it be sin unto thee Thou shalt surely give him and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him because that for this thing the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy works and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto for the poor shall never cease out of the land Therefore I command thee saying thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother to thy poor and to thy needy in thy land And if thy brother an Hebrew man or an Hebrew woman be sold unto thee and serve thee six years then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee And when thou sendest him out free from thee thou shalt not let him go away empty thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock and out of thy floor and out of thy winepress of that wherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him Shall the United States which cannot bear the bonds of a king cradle the bondage which a king is abolishing Shall a republic be less free than a monarchy Shall we in the vigor and buoyancy of our manhood be less energetic in righteousness than a kingdom in its age--C STEWART Shall every flap of England's flag Proclaim that all around are free From farthest Ind to each blue crag That beetles o'er the Western Sea And shall we scoff at Europe's kings When freedom's fire is dim with us And round our country's altar clings The damning shade of slavery's curse Go let us ask of Constantine To lose his grasp on Poland's throat And beg the lord of Mahmoud's line To spare the struggling Suliote Will not the scorching answer come From turbaned Turk and fiery Russ Go loose your fettered slaves at home Then turn and ask the like of us WHITTIER We northern men have to pay taxes for so many head of cattle and so many head of horses--and if they own houses they have to pay taxes for them and if they own land they have to pay taxes for that Now our white brethren at the south have to pay taxes for these houses and lands and their horses and cattle so says says for their human cattle they do not pay one cent of tax and for these human cattle they will sell for eight to fifteen hundred dollars--so much profit to them--and yet do not pay taxes for them says that there was a gentleman in the town of Lynn told him the town of Lynn had lost one million dollars by the south says there was a gentleman in the town of R told him that the town of R had lost fifty or sixty thousand dollars and several other towns that had lost money by the white brethren in the south so says At Norfolk there is between two and three hundred men kept there What are they kept there for Why to keep the blacks in slavery Our free and independent colors float there at the capital so they do and says there is almost three million slaves held in bondage under these floating colors Now where does the support come from that keeps these soldiers there Why pretty much the whole heft comes out of the north You white friends will all unite together instead of rising and shaking the dust off your feet and having nothing to do with them bad tarlims in the south but is afraid that you white friends will unite together and will leave you as poor as poverty as the poor slave is before you see the horrors and the evils and the iniquity of slavery has traveled through twelve different States and one hundred miles in Canada and never was entertained so hospitable in my life as I was by Mr Ward Richards in West Bridgewater And if I never see him no more I pray God I may have grace to meet in heaven And I was traveling in South Bridgewater and fell in with a white lady but I did not learn her name and I asked her if she would not be good enough to sell me a slice of wheat bread and because I called her honey she got very angry with me I did not mean any harm by calling her honey but she had a great deal of southern temper in her but she is unconscious of everything that's reasonable She called a damned black scoundrel and all the names she could think of and hailed to her husband to come away from the lower part of the field and he came running with a hoe and leaped over a fence about four foot high and he hollered ho ye dam'd rebel you what have you been a doing to my wife you dam'd black scoundrel you My answer was as quick as possible to him--I have been doing nothing but that did not seem to be of any satisfaction to him and then I had to spring for a rock as quick as possible or he would split me through with the hoe was travelling the other side of the Juniatta river I fell in to a white lady's house and was almost starved to death She was a tall slim lady and fair complected and I asked her for a piece of bread and meat and she filled my hat full thinks she had a fair heart too for because she done as God commanded her to do And how was that To divide with your brethren and set down alongside of the Juniatta river in the State of Pennsylvania and begin to eat out of my hat and saw a white man come along ha says he ye dam'd scoundrel you get up and come to me I got up as soon as I could but I had no idea of coming to him I stood and considered and he told me to lay down my hat and come quick--but I laid for the water as quick as possible and came across the water and some places the water took me up to my neck and the wind blew very hard and took off my hat and my bread and good nice meat with my hat sailed down the river I consider all that nothing but the Lord took care of my unworthy life and saved me from drowning and not only that but kept my body out of the hands of that Arab and in the evening crawled into a barn and the Lord took care of my unworthy body in that barn as well as the king in his palace with his army of soldiers around him What a blessed thing it is for any poor soul to put their trust in the Lord The Lord has took care of through sorrow and affliction the Lord has delivered me out of the hands of a hard taskmaster he has blessed my unworthy body on free soil and my face Zionward towards his holy kingdom Since has come away from my hard taskmaster I have fell among sincere Christian people Sometimes I think I never will have grace to meet these dear friendly white people in heaven Know that the day's coming that the slaveholder and the slave has got to stand before the tribunal bar and there render account before a holy God the same as the murderer stretched on the gallows before judges and jurors When we are brought before a holy God whose judgment is quick and powerful sharper than a two edged sword his judgment is not like man from to years his judgments are forever Whilst thousands of years roll around If we die in the full triumph of a holy faith will take a leap right into his holy kingdom and there will live forever And if we die with our hearts shut with sin and iniquity we'll go down to hell and there will burn forever When was in the town of Kennebunk in the State of Maine I fell in there with a white friend he treated hospitably and got up a meeting for me before I left the place There was a white gentleman asked me if I knew a man by the name of Ward Richards a dam'd scoundrel in West Bridgewater I told him I knew no such person but I knew a Christian gentleman by the name of Ward Richards Do you know what the Bible says if you don't like your brother you must not persecute him thinks you are as destitute of the Bible and every other good moral principle or else you would not stand up and persecute your white brother who has done you no harm because he stands up for equal rights for the poor degraded down trodden African man When was in Princeton he fell in a white lady's house and I got conversing with her about one thing and another and she told of a lady about sixty years of age and she was always very bitter against the anti-slavery cause They had an anti-slavery meeting in the place one of the anti-slavery women went and conversed with this old lady and she got very angry with this anti-slavery woman and she told if five cents would free all the negroes in the south she would not give it She was knitting as usual about four days afterwards when she fell down dead and some think it was a judgment of the Almighty upon her for her wicked bad doings Since has left home I have traveled through about all the free States I have been mobbed in a great many places but thank God I have not had any bones broke His life has been threatened but my Heavenly Father has looked down from above and saved my unworthy life I have been highly threatened to be sent back to my hard task-master Old Beelzebub the father of sin and iniquity if he had his way would have been sent back to his hard task-master long ago Thank God that God is above the devil and he has kept 's unworthy body out of the hands of his hard task-master This is what the way-faring requested me to write An abolitionist of Leominster THE WORN OUT SLAVE A preacher traveling through the Southern States was rowed across a ferry by a pious old negro who had labored hard through early manhood and middle age to purchase freedom for himself and his wife and he mourned that old age and loss of strength would compel him to leave all his children in slavery He laid his hand on his breast and Master has all my strength and I have these old bones His head was white and his eyes were dim And his face was marked by wo-- The vigor of youth had passed from him And labor had bent him low He gave the oars his remnant of strength As the shallop left the shore-- And he told his tale of grief at length Ere the stream was ferried o'er He looked on one with his eyes' dim ray That he ne'er shall see again Until the break of endless day Far beyond a tyrant's reign Master he you're a child of God His seal is upon your face Poor negro has felt his chast'ning rod And gloried too in his grace The sun that rose upon the master's morn Rejoiced o'er a free-born babe-- But the light that broke when I was born Looked down on a fetter'd slave I grew a pace to my bitter lot Too soon felt my heavy chain-- And often I cried Oh why will not Earth take back her child again I thought perhaps if I bent to toil That heaven might let me see A day in which I could tread the soil And breathe the air of the free I toiled at morn and I toiled at eve And I toiled in the mid day sun-- I rested not when they gave me leave And that my work was done I yielded not to summer's heat Nor turned from the winter's frost Nor sheltered myself from storms that beat-- Lest a copper should be lost I paid for myself I have paid for my wife-- But our sands are nearly run-- And the freedom I've bought at the end of life Would have come with my setting sun He smote his breast with his eyes on high In a voice of subdued tones --Master has all my strength and I Have nothing but these old bones Time adds a weight to each month that rolls We soon shall rest in our graves We trust in Christ to receive our souls-- BUT WE LEAVE OUR CHILDREN SLAVES When told that woman should not meddle with slavery point to the widow of Lovejoy left alone to rear her fatherless child and say that in a country where slavery strews with desolation a woman's hearth-stone it becomes a woman to seek for the cause and if possible to apply a remedy You have the authority of slaveholders for concerning yourselves even with politics At a political meeting in Mississippi the following toast was drank The Ladies--in the dark hour of our revolutionary struggle they nobly stood by us they will again do so in a struggle for correct principles--See Manchester Mi Whig Oct When you are keenly afflicted by meeting coldness apathy and indifference then offer to lend the Narrative of Charles Ball or James Williams or some other publication where the slave speaks for himself Tell the story of Mary Brown of Ohio who was stolen from her free parents in Washington city The committee who prepared the Ohio Report of which A Wattles was chairman say they are assured by those who knew Mary at the South that her statements may be implicitly relied on Her manner in telling her story was artless and simple bespeaking conscious truth She lived with her parents until the death of her mother One day when near the Potomac bridge Mr Humphrey the sheriff overtook her and told her she must go with him She inquired what for He made no reply but told her to come along He took her immediately to a slave auction Mary she was free but Mr Humprey contradicted her and the sale went on The auctioneer soon struck her off for to a Mississippi trader and she was taken directly to the jail After a few hours she was handcuffed chained to a man slave and started in a drove of about forty for New Orleans The handcuffs so swelled her wrists that they were obliged to take them off at night and put fetters on her ankles In the morning the handcuffs were again put on Thus they traveled for two weeks wading rivers being whiped up all day and beaten at night if they did not get their distance Mary says she frequently waded rivers in her chains with water up to her waist It was in October and the weather cold and frosty After traveling thus twelve or fifteen days her arms and ankles became so swollen that she felt she could go no farther Blisters would form on her feet as large as dollars which at night she would have to open while all day the shackles would cut into her lacerated wrists They had no beds and usually slept in barns or out on the naked ground--was in such misery when she lay down that she could only lie and cry all night Still they drove them on for another week Her spirits became so depressed and she grieved so much about leaving her friends that she could not eat and every time the trader caught her crying he would beat her accompanying it with dreadful curses She was at length seized with a burning fever and the trader fearing he should lose her carried her the remainder of the way in a wagon When they arrived at Natchez they were all offered for sale and as Mary was still sick she begged that she might be sold to a kind master She sometimes made this request in presence of purchasers--but was always insulted for it and after they were gone the trader punished her for such presumption in revealing her sickness and thus preventing her sale On one occasion he tied her up by her hands so that she could only touch the end of her toes to the floor This was soon after breakfast he kept her thus suspended whipping her at intervals through the day--at evening he took her down She was so much bruised that she could not lie down for more than a week afterwards The rest of her history while a slave is full of horror Her

they can support a gang and have a camp we may expect our negroes to run away In the same article he says the place whose delight had kept Squire so long from the happiness of slavery and to which the happy slaves would of course escape was a marsh almost impenetrable to our citizens During our two wars with Great Britain a multitude of slaves fled from their masters and joined the British forces To furnish the reader some data for judging of the number that escaped during the Revolutionary war we insert the following extract from Ramsay's History When the British evacuated Charleston S C in Governor Matthews demanded the restoration of some thousand of negroes who were within their lines These however were but a small part of the whole taken away at the evacuation but that number is very inconsiderable when compared with the thousands that were lost from the first to the last of the war It has been computed by good judges that between the years and the State of South Carolina lost twenty-five thousand negroes See Ramsay's Hist S C vol p At least a fifth part of all the slaves in the State at the beginning of the war Dr Ramsay being a native and resident of Charleston S C

home Slaves know when to seem contented Testimony of James Bradley an emancipated slave--He bought his freedom in when nearly years old In an account of his life in the Oasis speaking on this point he says--I do not believe there ever was a slave who did not long for liberty I was never acquainted with a slave however well he was treated who did not long to be free There is one thing about this that people in the free States do not understand When they ask slaves whether they wish for liberty they answer No and very likely they would say they would not leave their master for the world But at the same time they desire liberty more than any thing else The truth is if a slave shows any discontent he is sure to be treated worse and worked the harder for it and every slave knows this When they are alone all their talk is about liberty--liberty It is the great thought and feeling that fills the mind for all the time So says ISAIAH ch --A short that the wayfaring took out of God's holy word Behold the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither is the ear heavy that it cannot hear But your iniquities have separated between you and your God and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue hath muttered perverseness None calleth for justice nor any pleadeth for truth they trust in vanity and speak lies they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity They hatch cockatrice' eggs and weave the spider's web he that eateth of their eggs dieth and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper Their webs shall not become garments neither shall they cover themselves with their works their works are works of iniquity and the act of violence is found in their hands Their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting and destruction are in their paths The way of peace they know not and there is no judgment in their goings they have made them crooked paths Whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace Therefore is judgment far from us neither doth justice overtake us We wait for light but behold obscurity for brightness but we walk in darkness We grope for the wall like the blind and we grope as if we had no eyes we stumble at noon-day as in the night we are in desolate places as dead men We roar all like bears and mourn sore like doves we look for judgment but there is none for salvation but it is far off from us For our transgressions are multiplied before thee and our sins testify against us and as for our iniquities we know them In transgressing and lying against the Lord and departing away from our God speaking oppression and revolt conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood And judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth afar off for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter Yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey and the Lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment And he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him For he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak According to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun When the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him And the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob saith the Lord As for me this is my covenant with them saith the Lord My spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed saith the Lord from henceforth and forever I asked a man of sorrows and of tears Whose looks told anguish pressed him more than years He mused awhile and then distinctly -- Life is a burden--would that I were dead I asked a Christian who had early strayed From virtue's paths this was the answer made-- Life is a precious boon to mortals given Which if well spent will be renewed in heaven Here is a short sentence of the wayfaring A Section from the Life of Moses Grandy late a slave When I reached Deep Creek I went to the house of Captain Edward Minner He was very glad to see me for in former days I had done much business for him he how sorry he had been to hear that I was at field work He inquired where I was going I to Norfolk to get some of the merchants to let me have money to buy myself He replied 'What did I always say to you Was it not that I would let you have the money at any time if you would only tell me when you could be sold' He called Mrs Minner into the room and told her I could be sold for my freedom she was rejoiced to hear it He 'Put up your horse at Mr Western's tavern for you need go no farther I have plenty of old rusty dollars and no man shall put his hand on your collar again to say you are a slave Come and stay with me to-night and in the morning I will get Mr Garret's horse and go with you' Next morning we set off and found master at Major Farrence's at the cross canal where I knew he was to be that day to sell his share of the canal When I saw him he told me to go forward home for he would not sell me I felt sick and sadly disappointed Captain Minner stepped up to him and showed him the paper he had given me saying 'Mr Sawyer is not this your hand-writing' He replied 'Mistress the last word when I came away I was not to sell him but send him home again' Captain Minner 'Mind gentlemen I do not want him for a slave I want to buy him for freedom He will repay me the money and I shall not charge him a cent of interest for it I would not have a colored person to drag me down to hell for all the money in the world A gentleman who was by it was a shame I should be so treated I had bought myself so often that Mr Sawyer ought to let me go The very worst man as an overseer over the persons employed in digging the canal Mr Wiley M'Pherson was there he was never known to speak in favor of a colored person even he that Mr Sawyer ought to let me go as I had been sold so often At length Mr Sawyer consented I should go for and would take no less I wished Captain Minner to give the extra and not stand about it I believe it was what M'Pherson that induced my master to let me go for he was well known for his great severity to colored people so that after even he had so master could not stand out The Lord must have opened M'Pherson's heart to say it I have that M'Pherson was an overseer where slaves were employed in cutting canals The labor there is very severe The ground is often very boggy the negroes are up to the middle or much deeper in mud and water cutting away roots and baling out mud if they can keep their heads above water they work on--They lodge in huts or as they are called camps made of shingles or boards They lie down in the mud which has adhered to them making a great fire to dry themselves to keep off the cold No bedding whatever is allowed them it is only by work done over his task that any of them can get a blanket They are paid nothing except for this overwork Their masters come once a month to receive the money for their labor then perhaps some few very good masters will give them each some others some a pound of tobacco and some nothing at all The food is more abundant than that of field slaves indeed it is the best allowance in America--it consists of a peck of meal and six pounds of pork per week the pork is commonly not good it is damaged and is bought as cheap as possible at auction M'Pherson gave the same task to each slave of course the weak ones often failed to do it I have often seen him tie up persons and flog them in the morning only because they were unable to get the previous day's task done' after they were flogged pork or beef brine was put on their bleeding backs to increase the pain he sitting by resting himself and seeing it done After being thus flogged and pickled the sufferers often remained tied up all day the feet just touching the ground the legs tied and pieces of wood put between the legs All the motion allowed was a slight turn of the neck--Thus exposed and helpless the yellow flies and musquitoes in great numbers would settle on the bleeding and smarting back and put the sufferer to extreme torture This continued all day for they were not taken down till night Here is a short sentence of 's in conclusion Good News and Glad Tidings and Great Joy--He that is free in Christ is free indeed Then this is heaven I have often heard of heaven Behold here it is--Broad is the road that leads to death and thousands walk together there but wisdom shows a narrow path with here and there a traveller
CharlesBall,SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES A NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF CHARLES BALL A BLACK MAN WHO LIVED FORTY YEARS IN MARYLAND SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA AS A SLAVE UNDER VARIOUS MASTERS AND WAS ONE YEAR IN THE NAVY WITH COMMODORE BARNEY DURING THE LATE WAR CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE MANNERS AND USAGES OF THE PLANTERS AND SLAVEHOLDERS OF THE SOUTH-- A DESCRIPTION OF THE CONDITION AND TREATMENT OF THE SLAVES WITH OBSERVATIONS UPON THE STATE OF MORALS AMONGST THE COTTON PLANTERS AND THE PERILS AND SUFFERINGS OF A FUGITIVE SLAVE WHO TWICE ESCAPED FROM THE COTTON COUNTRY NEW YORK PUBLISHED BY JOHN S TAYLOR Brick Church Chapel verso ENTERED according to Act of Congress in the year BY JOHN S TAYLOR In the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the Southern DISTRICT OF NEW YORK HENRY LUDWIG PRINTER INTRODUCTION In giving a place in the CABINET OF FREEDOM to the ensuing narrative it is deemed proper to accompany it with some remarks The reader will be desirous to know how far it is entitled to his belief and the editors of the Cabinet are equally desirous that he should not be misled They have been furnished with the following certificate Lewistown Pa July th We the undersigned certify that we have read the book called 'CHARLES BALL'--that we know the black man whose narrative is given in this book and have heard him relate the principal matters contained in the book concerning himself long before the book was published DAVID W HOLINGS W P ELLIOTT This certificate establishes the fact that the subject of the narrative is not a fictitious personage Mr Fisher the author intimates in his preface what is indeed sufficiently obvious from the felicity of his style that the language of the book is not Mr Elliott is a justice of the peace and editor of the Lewistown Gazette Mr Holings is a lawyer and formerly a member of the Pennsylvania Legislature ii that of the unlettered slave whose adventures he records A similar intimation might with equal propriety have been given in reference to the various profound and interesting reflections interspersed throughout the work The author states in a private communication that many of the anecdotes in the book illustrative of southern society were not obtained from Ball but from other and creditable sources he avers however that all the facts which relate personally to the fugitive were received from his own lips How far this personal narrative is true is a question which each reader must of course decide for himself It is possible and not improbable that vanity may have induced the hero to exaggerate his exploits and that ignorance and forgetfulness may in some instances have rendered his tale discordant The hardships he encountered in his various attempts to escape from bondage are indeed extreme but are not for that reason incredible since it is difficult to estimate the amount of human suffering that can be voluntarily endured for an adequate object The account of his voyage from Savannah to Philadelphia strange as it is derives strong confirmation from the following still more extraordinary account taken from a New York journal The captain of a vessel from North Carolina called on the police for advisement respecting a slave he had unconsciously brought away in his vessel under the following curious circumstances Three or four days after he had got to sea he began iii to be haunted every hour with tones of distress seemingly proceeding from a human voice in the very lowest part of the vessel A particular scrutiny was finally instituted and it was concluded that the creature whatever and whoever it might be must be confined down in the run under the cabin floor and on boring a hole with an auger and demanding 'Who's there' a feeble voice responded 'Poor negro massa' It was clear enough then that some run-away negro had hid himself there before they sailed trusting to Providence for his ultimate escape Having discovered him however it was impossible to give him relief for the captain had stowed even the cabin so completely full of cotton as but just to leave room for a small table for himself and the mate to eat on and as for unloading at sea that was pretty much out of the question Accordingly there he had to lie stretched at full length for a tedious interval of thirteen days till the vessel arrived in port and unloaded receiving his food and drink through the auger hole The fellow's story is now he is released that being determined to get away from slavery he supplied himself with eggs and biscuit and some jugs of water which latter he was just on the point of depositing in his lurking place when he discovered the captain at a distance coming on board and had to hurry down as fast as possible and leave them That he lived on nothing but his eggs and biscuit till discovered by the captain not even getting a drop of water except what he had the good fortune iv to catch in his hand one day when a vessel of water in the cabin was upset during a squall and some of it ran down through the cracks of the floor over him--Commercial Advertiser With regard to the pictures given in this work of the internal Slave-trade and of the economy of a cotton plantation it may be observed that they are perfectly consistent not only with the various other representations which have from time to time been made by unimpeachable witnesses but also with the irresponsible despotism which is vested by law and custom in southern masters That despotism within the confines of a plantation is more absolute and irresistible than any that was ever wielded by a Roman emperor The power of the latter when no longer supportable was terminated by revolt or personal violence and often with impunity But to the despotism of the master there is scarcely any conceivable limit and from its cruelty there is no refuge His plantation is his empire his labourers are his subjects and revolt and violence instead of abridging his power are followed by inevitable and horrible punishment The laws of the land do not indeed authorize the master to take life but they do not forbid him to wear it out by excessive toil Public opinion sometimes exercises a more controlling influence than law and it may perhaps be supposed that it throws its shield before the helpless slave But it should be recollected that public opinion at the south is the opinion of the masters themselves and that they are individually amenable to it v chiefly in regard to their intercourse with each other as citizens and not in regard to the authority they exercise over their property In his negro quarters or his cotton field the planter is withdrawn from the gaze of his neighbours who have neither the right nor the disposition to scrutinize his conduct He is there an unquestioned despot and his vassals have no press to proclaim their wrongs no tribunal to petition for a redress of grievances and are prohibited from entering a Court of Justice as suitors or even as witnesses against any individual whose complexion is not coloured like their own Hence it follows that the master is virtually the arbiter of life and death All history and all our knowledge of human nature unite in bearing testimony to the hardening and corrupting influence of irresponsible power on its possessor Some indeed are shielded against this influence by natural benevolence or religious principle and it is creditable to Ball's candour that he mentions instances of kindness on the part of the masters--but such instances must necessarily from the very constitution of our nature be exceptions to the general rule The cruelty and detestable injustice of the slave code in all ages and in all countries conclusively establishes the general effect of slavery in paralyzing the moral sense Some readers may be disposed to doubt Ball's veracity on account of the atrocious cruelties he relates Such a doubt evinces a very imperfect acquaintance with southern feelings and manners The cruelties recorded in the narrative were practised by a few vi individuals but if assembled multitudes in the slave-states can publicly unite in perpetrating still greater atrocities then surely the story told by Ball is not incredible The following deeds of horror recounted by the public journals render tame and insignificant the acts of cruelty detailed in the work before us Tuscaloosa Alabama HORRID OCCURRENCE--Some time during the last week one of those outrageous transactions and we really think disgraceful to the character of civilized man took place near the north-east boundary line of Perry adjoining Bibb and Autauga counties The circumstances we are informed by a gentleman from that county are--that a Mr McNeilly having lost some clothing or other property of no great value the slave of a neighbouring planter was charged with the theft McNeilly in company with his brother found the negro driving his master's wagon--they seized him and either did or were about to chastise him when the negro stabbed McNeilly so that he died in an hour afterwards The negro was taken before a justice of the peace who after serious deliberation waived his authority perhaps through fear as the crowd of persons from the above counties had collected to the number of seventy or eighty men near Mr People's the justice house He acted as president of the mob and put the vote when it was decided he should be immediately executed by beingiBURNT TO DEATH vii The sable culprit was led to a tree and tied to it and a large quantity of pine knots collected and placed round him and the fatal torch applied to the pile even against the remonstrances of several gentlemen who were present and the miserable being was in a short time burnt to ashes This is the SECOND negro who has been THUS put to death without judge or jury in that county On the th of April a negro was burnt alive at St Louis by a numerous mob The Alton Telegraph gives the following particulars All was silent as death while the executioners were piling wood around the victim He not a word probably feeling that the flames had seized upon him He then uttered an awful howl attempting to sing and pray then hung his head and suffered in silence excepting in the following instance-- After the flames had surrounded their prey and when his clothes were in a blaze all over him his eyes burnt out of his head and his mouth seemingly parched to a cinder some one in the crowd more compassionate than the rest proposed to put an end to his misery by shooting him when it was replied 'that would be of no use since he was already out of pain' 'No no' the wretch 'I am not--I am suffering as much as ever--shoot me shoot me' 'No no' one of the fiends who was standing about the sacrifice they were roasting 'he shall not be shot I would sooner slacken the fire if that would increase his misery' and the viii man who this was we understand an officer of justice We understand says the New Orleans Post of June th that a negro man was lately condemned by the mob to be BURNED OVER A SLOW FIRE which was put into execution at Grand Gulf for murdering a black woman and her master Mr Green a respectable citizen of that place who attempted to save her from the clutches of this monster We have been informed says the Arkansas Gazette of the th October that the slave William who murdered his master Huskey some weeks since and several negroes was taken by a party a few days since from the Sheriff of Hot Springs and BURNED ALIVE yes tied up to to limb of a tree a fire built under him and consumed in slow and lingering torture It has been already observed that the master is virtually the arbiter of life and death How far the state of public opinion at the south confirms or contradicts this assertion may be seen from the annexed report of a suit brought to recover the value of a murdered slave If he who takes the life of another's slave is permitted to go at large without molestation after making compensation for the property destroyed who shall presume to punish the owner for doing what he will with his own From the Nashville Tennessee Banner June INTERESTING TRIAL--During the session of ix the circuit-court for Davison county which adjourned a few days since a case was tried of more than usual interest to the public It was that of Meeks against Philips for the value of a slave who had been killed by Philips whilst in the employment of Meeks as his overseer The following abstract of the evidence was furnished us by a disinterested member of the bar who was not engaged as counsel for either side of the cause 'It appeared in evidence that the negro had disobeyed Philips' orders in going away one night without his permission for which in accordance with his duty he undertook to chastise him The boy proved somewhat refractory and probably offered resistance though there was no direct evidence of the fact From Philip's admissions which must be taken for as well as against him it seems he had a scuffle with the boy during which the boy inflicted a blow upon him which produced great pain Philips with assistance finally subdued him While endeavouring to swing him to the limb of a tree he resisted by pulling back whereupon Philips who is a large and strong man gave him several blows upon his head with the butt of a loaded horsewhip Having tied him to the limb the rope gave way and the boy fell to the ground when Philips gave him several violent kicks in the side and again swung him to the tree He then called for a cow-hide which was accordingly brought arid the chastisement was commenced anew The suffering wretch implored for x mercy in vain Phili s would whip him awhile and then rest only to renew his strokes and wreak his vengeance for he repeatedly avowed his intention of whipping him to death--saying he had as good a negro to put in his room or remunerate his master for the loss of him The sufferer writhing under the stinging tortures of the lash continued to implore for mercy while those who were present interposed and pleaded too in his behalf but there was no relenting arm until life was nearly extinct and feeling had taken its departure He was cut loose bleeding and weak overcome with extreme exhaustion and debility and died in a few minutes after' The jury of course found for the plaintiff xi PREFACE IN the following s the reader will find embodied the principal incidents that have occurred in the life of a slave in the United States of America The narrative is taken from the mouth of the adventurer himself and if the copy does not retain the identical words of the original the sense and import at least are faithfully preserved Many of his opinions have been cautiously omitted or carefully suppressed as being of no value to the reader and his sentiments upon the subject of slavery have not been embodied in this work The design of the writer who is no more than the recorder of the facts detailed to him by another has been to render the narrative as simple and the style of the story as plain as the laws of the language would permit To introduce the reader as it were to a view of the cotton fields and exhibit not to his imagination but to his very eyes the mode of life to which the slaves on the southern plantations must conform has been the primary object of the compiler The book has been written without fear or prejudice and no opinions have been consulted in its composition The sole view of the writer has been to make the citizens of the United States acquainted with each other and to give a faithful portrait of the manners usages and customs of the southern people so far as those manners usages and customs xii have fallen under the observations of a common negro slave endued by nature with a tolerable portion of intellectual capacity The more reliance is to be placed upon his relations of those things that he saw in the southern country when it is recollected that he had been born and brought up in a part of the state of Maryland in which of all others the spirit of the old aristocracy as it has not unaptly been called retained much of its pristine vigour in his youth and where he had an early opportunity of seeing many of the most respectable best educated and most highly enlightened families of both Maryland and Virginia a constant succession of kind offices friendly visits and family alliances having at that day united the most distinguished inhabitants of the two sides of the Potomac in the social relations of one people It might naturally be expected that a man who had passed through so many scenes of adversity and had suffered so many wrongs at the hands of his fellow-man would feel much of the bitterness of heart that is engendered by a remembrance of unatoned injuries but every sentiment of this kind has been carefully excluded from the following s in which the reader will find nothing but an unadorned detail of acts and the impressions those acts produced on the mind of him upon whom they operated NARRATIVE I THE system of slavery as practised in the United States has been and is now but little understood by the people who live north of the Potomac and the Ohio for although individual cases of extreme cruelty and oppression occasionally occur in Maryland yet the general treatment of the black people is far more lenient and mild in that state than it is farther south This I presume is mainly to be attributed to the vicinity of the free state of Pennsylvania but in no small degree to the influence of the population of the cities of Baltimore and Washington over the families of the planters of the surrounding counties For experience has taught me that both masters and mistresses who if not observed by strangers would treat their slaves with the utmost rigour are so far operated upon by a sense of shame or pride as to provide them tolerably with both food and clothing when they know their conduct is subject to the observation of persons whose good opinion they wish to preserve A large number of the most respectable and wealthy people in both Washington and Baltimore being altogether opposed to the practice of slavery hold a constant control over the actions of their friends the farmers and thus prevent much misery but in the south the case is widely different There every man and every woman too except prevented by poverty is a slave-holder and the entire white population is leagued together by a common bond of the most sordid interest in the torture and oppression of the poor descendants of Africa If the negro is wronged there is no one to whom he can complain-- if suffering for want of the coarsest food he dare not steal--if flogged till the flesh falls from his bones he must not murmur--and if compelled to perform his daily toil in an iron collar no expression of resentment must escape his lips People of the northern states who make excursions to the south visit the principal cities and towns travel the most frequented highways or even sojourn for a time at the residences of the large planters and partake of their hospitality and amusements know nothing of the condition of the southern slaves To acquire this knowledge the traveller must take up his abode for a season in the lodge of the overseer pass a summer in the remote cotton fields or spend a year within view of the rice swamps By attending for one month the court which the overseer of a large estate holds every evening in the cotton-gin yard and witnessing the execution of his decrees a Turk or a Russian would find the tribunals of his country far outdone It seems to be a law of nature that slavery is equally destructive to the master and the slave for whilst it stupifies the latter with fear and reduces him below the condition of man it brutalizes the former by the practice of continual tyranny and makes him the prey of all the vices which render human nature loathsome In the following simple narrative of an unlearned man I have endeavoured faithfully and truly to present to the reader some of the most material accidents which occurred to myself in a period of thirty years of slavery in the free Republic of the United States as well as many circumstances which I observed in the condition and conduct of other persons during that period It has been supposed by many that the state of the southern slaves is constantly becoming better and that the treatment which they receive at the hands of their masters is progressively milder and more humane but the contrary of all this is unquestionably the truth for under the bad culture which is practised in the south the land is constantly becoming poorer and the means of getting food more and more difficult So long as the land is new and rich and produces corn and sweet potatoes abundantly the black people seldom suffer greatly for food but when the ground is all cleared and planted in rice or cotton corn and potatoes become scarce and when corn has to be bought on a cotton plantation the people must expect to make acquaintance with hunger My grandfather was brought from Africa and sold as a slave in Calvert county in Maryland about the year I never understood the name of the ship in which he was imported nor the name of the planter who bought him on his arrival but at the time I knew him he was a slave in a family called Mauel who resided near Leonardtown My father was a slave in a family named Hantz living near the same place My mother was the slave of a tobacco planter an old man who died according to the best of my recollection when I was about four years old leaving his property in such a situation that it became necessary as I suppose to sell a part of it to pay his debts Soon after his death several of his slaves and with others myself were sold at public vendue My mother had several children my brothers and sisters and we were all sold on the same day to different purchasers Our new master took us away and I never saw my mother nor any of my brothers and sisters afterwards This was I presume about the year I learned subsequently from my father that my mother was sold to a Georgia trader who soon after that carried her away from Maryland Her other children were sold to slave-dealers from Carolina and were also taken away so that I was left alone in Calvert county with my father whose owner lived only a few miles from my new master's residence At the time I was sold I was quite naked having never had any clothes in my life but my new master had brought with him a child's frock or wrapper belonging to one of his own children and after he had purchased me he dressed me in this garment took me before him on his horse and started home but my poor mother when she saw me leaving her for the last time ran after me took me down from the horse clasped me in her arms and wept loudly and bitterly over me My master seemed to pity her and endeavoured to soothe her distress by telling her that he would be a good master to me and that I should not want any thing She then still holding me in her arms walked along the road beside the horse as he moved slowly and earnestly and imploringly besought my master to buy her and the rest of her children and not permit them to be carried away by the negro buyers but whilst thus entreating him to save her and her family the slave-driver who had first bought her came running in pursuit of her with a raw hide in his hand When he overtook us he told her he was her master now and ordered her to give that little negro to its owner and come back with him My mother then turned to him and cried Oh master do not take me from my child Without making any reply he gave her two or three heavy blows on the shoulders with his raw hide snatched me from her arms handed me to my master and seizing her by one arm dragged her back towards the place of sale My master then quickened the pace of his horse and as we advanced the cries of my poor parent became more and more indistinct-- at length they died away in the distance and I never again heard the voice of my poor mother Young as I was the horrors of that day sank deeply into my heart and even at this time though half a century has elapsed the terrors of the scene return with painful vividness upon my memory Frightened at the sight of the cruelties inflicted upon my poor mother I forgot my own sorrows at parting from her and clung to my new master as an angel and a saviour when compared with the hardened fiend into whose power she had fallen She had been a kind and good mother to me had warmed in her bosom in the cold nights of winter and had often divided the scanty pittance of food allowed her by her mistress between my brothers and sisters and me and gone supperless to bed herself Whatever victuals she could obtain beyond the coarse food salt fish and corn-bread allowed to slaves on the Patuxent and Potomac rivers she carefully distributed among her children and treated us with all the tenderness which her own miserable condition would permit I have no doubt that she was chained and driven to Carolina and toiled out the residue of a forlorn and famished existence in the rice swamps or indigo fields of the south My father never recovered from the effects of the shock which this sudden and overwhelming ruin of his family gave him He had formerly been of a gay social temper and when he came to see us on a Saturday night he always brought us some little present such as the means of a poor slave would allow--apples melons sweet potatoes or if he could procure nothing else a little parched corn which tasted better in our cabin because he had brought it He spent the greater part of the time which his master permitted him to pass with us in relating such stories as he had learned from his companions or in singing the rude songs common amongst the slaves of Maryland and Virginia After this time I never heard him laugh heartily or sing a song He became gloomy and morose in his temper to all but me and sp nt nearly all his leisure time with my grandfather who claimed kindred with some royal family in Africa and had been a great warrior in his native country The master of my father was a hard penurious man and so exceedingly avaricious that he scarcely allowed himself the common conveniences of life A stranger to sensibility he was incapable of tracing the change in the temper and deportment of my father to its true cause but attributed it to a sullen discontent with his condition as a slave and a desire to abandon his service and seek his liberty by escaping to some of the free states To prevent the perpetration of this suspected crime of running away from slavery the old man resolved to sell my father to a southern slave-dealer and accordingly applied to one of those men who was at that time in Calvert to become the purchaser The price was agreed on but as my father was a very strong active and resolute man it was deemed unsafe for the Georgian to attempt to seize him even with the aid of others in the day-time when he was at work as it was known he carried upon his person a large knife It was therefore determined to secure him by stratagem and for this purpose a farmer in the neighbourhood who was made privy to the plan alleged that he had lost a pig which must have been stolen by some one and that he suspected my father to be the thief A constable was employed to arrest him but as he was afraid to undertake the business alone he called on his way at the house of the master of my grandfather to procure assistance from the overseer of the plantation When he arrived at the house the overseer was at the barn and thither he repaired to make his application At the end of the barn was the coach-house and as the day was cool to avoid the wind which was high the two walked to the side of the coach-house to talk over the matter and settle their plan of operations It so happened that my grandfather whose business it was to keep the coach in good condition was at work at this time rubbing the plated handles of the doors and brightening the other metallic parts of the vehicle Hearing the voice of the overseer without he suspended his work and listening attentively became a party to their councils They agreed that they would delay the execution of their project until the next day as it was then late The supposed they would have no difficulty in apprehending their intended victim as knowing himself innocent of the theft he would readily consent to go with the constable to a justice of the peace to have the charge examined That night however about midnight my grandfather silently repaired to the cabin of my father a distance of about three miles aroused him from his sleep made him acquainted with the extent of his danger gave him a bottle of cider and a small bag of parched corn and then praying to the God of his native country to protect his son enjoined him to fly from the destruction which awaited him In the morning the Georgian could not find his newly purchased slave who was never seen or heard of in Maryland from that day He probably had prudence enough to conceal himself in the day and travel only at night by this means making his way slowly up the country between the Patapsco and Patuxent until he was able to strike across to the north and reach Pennsylvania After the flight of my father my grandfather was the only person left in Maryland with whom I could claim kindred He was at that time an old man as he himself nearly eighty years of age and he manifested towards me all the fondness which a person so far advanced in life could be expected to feel for a child As he was too feeble to perform much hard labour his master did not require him either to live or to work with the common field hands who were employed the greater part of the year in cultivating tobacco and preparing it for market that being the staple crop of all the lower part of the western shore of Maryland at that time Indeed old Ben as my grandfather was called had always expressed great contempt for his fellow slaves they being as he a mean and vulgar race quite beneath his rank and the dignity of his former station He had during all the time that I knew him a small cabin of his own with about half an acre of ground attached to it which he cultivated on his own account and from which he drew a large portion of his subsistence He entertained strange and peculiar notions of religion and prayed every night though he he ought to pray oftener but that his God would excuse him for the non-performance of this duty in consideration of his being a slave and compelled to devote his whole time to the service of his master He never went to church or meeting and held that the religion of this country was altogether false and indeed no religion at all being the mere invention of priests and crafty men who hoped thereby to profit through the ignorance and credulity of the multitude In support of this opinion he maintained that there could only be one true standard of faith which was the case in his country where all the people worshipped together in the same assembly and believed in the same doctrines which had been of old time delivered by the true God to a holy man who was taken up into heaven for that purpose and after he had received the divine communication had returned to earth and spent a hundred years in preaching and imparting the truth which had been revealed to him to mankind This inspired man resided in some country at a great distance from that of my grandfather but had come there across a part of the sea in company with an angel and instructed the people in the mysteries of the true faith which had ever since been preserved in its utmost purity by the descendants of those who received it through a period of more than ten thousand years My grandfather that the tenets of this religion were so plain and self-evident that any one could understand them without any other instruction than the reading of a small book a copy of which was kept in every family and which contained all the rules both of faith and practice necessary for any one to know or exercise No one was permitted to expound or explain this book as it was known to be the oracle of the true God and it was held impious for any person to give a construction to his words different from that which was so palpably and manifestly expressed on the face of the book This book was likewise written in such plain and intelligible language that only one meaning could possibly be given to any one part of it and was withal so compendious and brief that people could with very little labour commit the whole of its precepts to memory The priests had at several times attempted to publish commentaries and glossaries upon this book but as often as this had been attempted the perpetrators had been tried found guilty of conspiring to corrupt the public morals and then banished from the country People who were disposed to worship publicly convened together in summer under the boughs of a large tree and the eldest person present read the inspired book from beginning to end which could be done in two hours at most Sometimes a priest was employed to read the book but he was never by any means allowed to add any observations of his own as it would have been considered absurd as well as very wicked for a mere man to attempt to add to alter amend or in any manner give a colouring to the revealed word of God In winter when it rained constantly the worshippers met under the roof of a house covered with the leaves of a certain tree which grew in great abundance on the margins of all the streams The law imposed no penalties on those who did not profess to believe the contents of the sacred book but those who did not live according to its rules were deemed had subjects and were compelled to become soldiers as being fit only for a life of bloodshed and cruelty The book inculcated no particular form of belief and left men free to profess what faith they pleased but its principles of morality were extremely rigid and uncompromising Love of country charity and social affection were the chief points of duty enjoined by it Lying and drunkenness were strictly prohibited and those guilty of these vices were severely punished Cruelty was placed in the same rank of crimes but the mode of punishment was left entirely to the civil law-giver The book required neither fastings penances nor pilgrimages but tenderness to wives and children was one of its most positive injunctions II The name of the man who purchased me at the vendue and became my master was John Cox but he was generally called Jack Cox He was a man of kindly feelings towards his family and treated his slaves of whom he had several besides me with humanity He permitted my grandfather to visit me as often as he pleased and allowed him sometimes to carry me to his own cabin which stood in a lonely place at the head of a deep hollow almost surrounded by a thicket of cedar trees which had grown up in a worn out and abandoned tobacco field My master gave me better clothes than the little slaves of my age generally received in Calvert and often told me that he intended to make me his waiter and that if I behaved well I should become his overseer in time These stations of waiter and overseer appeared to me to be the highest points of honour and greatness in the whole world and had not circumstances frustrated my master's plans as well as my own views I should probably have been living at this time in a cabin on the corner of some tobacco plantation Fortune had decreed otherwise When I was about twelve years old my master Jack Cox died of a disease which had long confined him to the house I was sorry for the death of my master who had always been kind to me and I soon discovered that I had good cause to regret his departure from this world He had several children at the time of his death who were all young the oldest being about my own age The father of my late master who was still living became administrator of his estate and took possession of his property and amongst the rest of myself This old gentleman treated me with the greatest severity and compelled me to work very hard on his plantation for several years until I suppose I must have been near or quite twenty years of age As I was always very obedient and ready to execute all his orders I did not receive much whipping but suffered greatly for want of sufficient and proper food My master allowed his slaves a peck of corn each per week throughout the year and this we had to grind into meal in a hand mill for ourselves We had a tolerable supply of meat for a short time about the month of December when he killed his hogs After that season we had meat once a week unless bacon became scarce which very often happened in which case we had no meat at all However as we fortunately lived near both the Patuxent river and the Chesapeake Bay we had abundance of fish in the spring and as long as the fishing season continued After that period each slave received in addition to his allowance of corn one salt herring every day My master gave me one pair of shoes one pair of stockings one hat one jacket of coarse cloth two coarse shirts and two pair of trousers yearly He allowed me no other clothes In the winter time I often suffered very much from the cold as I had to drive the team of oxen which hauled the tobacco to market and frequently did not get home until late at night the distance being considerable and my cattle travelling very slow One Saturday evening when I came home from the corn field my master told me that he had hired me out for a year at the city of Washington and that I would have to live at the navy-yard On the new-year's-day following which happened about two weeks afterwards my master set forward for Washington on horseback and ordered me to accompany him on foot It was night when we arrived at the navy-yard and every thing appeared very strange to me I was told by a gentleman who had epaulets on his shoulders that I must go on board a large ship which lay in the river He at the same time told a boy to show me the way This ship proved to be the Congress frigate and I was told that I had been brought there to cook for the people belonging to her In the course of a few days the duties of my station became quite familiar to me and in the enjoyment of a profusion of excellent provisions I felt very happy I strove by all means to please the officers and gentlemen who came on board and in this I soon found my account One gave me a half-worn coat another an old shirt and a third a cast off waistcoat and pantaloons Some presented me with small sums of money and in this way I soon found myself well clothed and with more than a dollar in my pocket My duties though constant were not burthensome and I was permitted to spend Sunday afternoon in my own way I generally went up into the city to see the new and splendid buildings often walked as far as Georgetown and made many new acquaintances amongst the slaves and frequently saw large numbers of people of my colour chained together in long trains and driven off towards the south At that time the Slave-trade was not regarded with so much indignation and disgust as it is now It was a rare thing to hear of a person of colour running away and escaping altogether from his master my father being the only one within my knowledge who had before this time obtained his liberty in this manner in Calvert county and as before stated I never heard what became of him after his flight I remained on board the Congress and about the navy-yard two years and was quite satisfied with my lot until about three months before the expiration of this period when it so happened that a schooner loaded with iron and other materials for the use of the yard arrived from Philadelphia She came and lay close by the Congress to discharge her cargo and amongst her crew I observed a black man with whom in the course of a day or two I became acquainted He told me he was free and lived in Philadelphia where he kept a house of entertainment for sailors which he was attended to in his absence by his wife His description of Philadelphia and of the liberty enjoyed there by the black people so charmed my imagination that I determined to devise some plan of escaping from the Congress and making my way to the north I communicated my designs to my new friend who promised to give me his aid We agreed that the night before the schooner should sail I was to be concealed in the hold amongst a parcel of loose tobacco which he the captain had undertaken to carry to Philadelphia The sailing of the schooner was delayed longer than we expected and finally her captain purchased a cargo of flour in Georgetown and sailed for the West Indies Whilst I was anxiously awaiting some other opportunity of making my way to Philadelphia the idea of crossing the country to the western part of Pennsylvania never entered my mind new-year's-day came and with it came my old master from Calvert accompanied by a gentleman named Gibson to whom he he had sold me and to whom he delivered me over in the navy-yard We all three set out that same evening for Calvert and reached the residence of my new master the next day Here I was informed that I had become the subject of a law-suit My new master claimed me under his purchase from old Mr Cox and another gentleman of the neighbourhood named Levin Ballard had bought me of the children of my former master Jack Cox This suit continued in the courts of Calvert county more than two years but was finally decided in favour of him who had bought me of the children I went home with my master Mr Gibson who was a farmer and with whom I lived three years Soon after I came to live with Mr Gibson I married a girl of colour named Judah the slave of a gentleman by the name of Symmes who resided in the same neighbourhood I was at the house of Mr Symmes every week and became as well acquainted with him and his family as I was with my master Mr Symmes also married a wife about the time I did The lady whom he married lived near Philadelphia and when she first came to Maryland she refused to be served by a black chambermaid but employed a white girl the daughter of a poor man who lived near The lady was reported to be very wealthy and brought a large trunk full of plate and other valuable articles This trunk was so heavy that I could scarcely carry it and it impressed my mind with the idea of great riches in the owner at that time After some time Mrs Symmes dismissed her white chambermaid and placed my wife in that situation which I regarded as a fortunate circumstance as it insured her good food and at least one good suit of clothes The Symmes' family was one of the most ancient in Maryland and had been a long time resident in Calvert county The grounds had been laid out and all the improvements projected about the family abode in a style of much magnificence according to the custom of the old aristocracy of Maryland and Virginia Appendant to the domicile and at no great distance from the house was a family vault built of brick in which reposed the occupants of the estate who had lived there for many previous generations This vault had not been opened or entered for fifteen years previous to the time of which I speak but it so happened that at this period a young man a distant relation of the family died having requested on his death-bed that he might be buried in this family resting place When I came on Saturday evening to see my wife and child Mr Symmes desired me as I was older than any of his black men to take an iron pick and go and open the vault which I accordingly did by cutting away the mortar and removing a few bricks from one side of the building but I could not remove more than three or four bricks before I was obliged by the horrid effluvia which issued at the aperture to retire It was the most deadly and sickening scent that I have ever smelled and I could not return to complete the work until after the sun had risen the next day when I pulled down so much of one of the side walls as to permit persons to walk in upright I then went in alone and examined this house of the dead and surely no picture could more strongly and vividly depict the emptiness of all earthly vanity and the nothingness of human pride Dispersed over the floor lay the fragments of more than twenty human skeletons each in the place where it had been deposited by the idle tenderness of surviving friends In some cases nothing remained but the hair and the larger bones whilst in several the form of the coffin was yet visible with all the bones resting in their proper places One coffin the sides of which were yet standing the lid only having decayed and partly fallen in so as to disclose the contents of this narrow cell presented a peculiarly moving spectacle Upon the centre of the lid was a large silver plate and the head and foot were adorned with silver stars The nails which had united the parts of the coffin had also silver heads Within lay the skeletons of a mother and her infant child in slumbers only to be broken by the peal of the last trumpet The bones of the infant lay upon the breast of the mother where the hands of affection had shrouded them The ribs of the parent had fallen down and rested on the back bone Many gold rings were about the bones of the fingers Brilliant ear-rings lay beneath where the ears had been and a glittering gold chain encircled the ghastly and haggard vertebrae of a once beautiful neck The shroud and flesh had disappeared but the hair of the mother appeared strong and fresh Even the silken locks of the infant were still preserved Behold the end of youth and beauty and of all that is lovely in life The coffin was so much decayed that it could not be removed A thick and dismal vapour hung embodied from the roof and walls of this charnal house in appearance somewhat like a mass of dark cobwebs but which was impalpable to the touch and when stirred by the hand vanished away On the second day we deposited with his kindred the corpse of the young man and at night I again carefully closed up the breach which I had made in the walls of this dwelling-place of the dead III Some short time after my wife became chambermaid to her mistress it was my misfortune to change masters once more Levin Ballard who as before stated had purchased me of the children of my former master Jack Cox was successful in his law suit with Mr Gibson the object of which was to determine the right of property in me and one day whilst I was at work in the corn-field Mr Ballard came and told me I was his property asking me at the same time if I was willing to go with him I told him I was not willing to go but that if I belonged to him I knew I must We then went to the house and Mr Gibson not being at home Mrs Gibson told me I must go with Mr Ballard I accordingly went with him determining to serve him obediently and faithfully I remained in his service almost three years and as he lived near the residence of my wife's master my former mode of life was not materially changed by this change of home Mrs Symmes spent much of her time in exchanging visits with the families of the other large planters both in Calvert and the neighbouring counties and through my wife I became acquainted with the private family history of many of the principal persons in Maryland There was a great proprietor who resided in another county who owned several hundred slaves and who permitted them to beg of travellers on the high-way This same gentleman had several daughters and according to the custom of the time kept what they called open house that is his house was free to all persons of genteel appearance who chose to visit it The young ladies were supposed to be the greatest fortunes in the country were reputed beautiful and consequently were greatly admired Two gentlemen who were lovers of these girls desirous of amusing their mistresses invited a young man whose standing in society they supposed to be beneath theirs to go with them to the manor as it was called When there they endeavoured to make him an object of ridicule in presence of the ladies but he so well acquitted himself and manifested such superior wit and talents that one of the young ladies fell in love with him and soon after wrote him a letter which led to their marriage His two pretended friends were never afterwards countenanced by the family as gentlemen of honour but the fortunate husband avenged himself of his heartless companions by inviting them to his wedding and exposing them to the observation of the vast assemblage of fashionable people who always attended a marriage in the family of a great planter The two gentlemen who had been thus made to fall into the pit that they had dug for another were so much chagrined at the issue of the adventure that one soon left Maryland and the other became a common drunkard and died a few years afterwards My change of masters realised all the evil apprehensions which I had entertained I found Mr Ballard sullen and crabbed in his temper and always prone to find fault with my conduct--no matter how hard I had laboured or how careful I was to fulfil all his orders and obey his most unreasonable commands Yet it so happened that he never beat me for which I was altogether indebted to the good character for inus try sobriety and humility which I had established in the neighbourhood I think he was ashamed to abuse me lest he should suffer in the good opinion of the public for he often fell into the most violent fits of anger against me and overwhelmed me with coarse and abusive language He did not give me clothes enough to keep me warm in winter and compelled me to work in the woods when there was deep snow on the ground by which I suffered very much I had determined at last to speak to him to sell me to some person in the neighbourbood so that I might still be near my wife and children--but a different fate awaited me My master kept a store at a small village on the bank of the Patuxent river called B---- although he resided at some distance on a farm One morning he rose early and ordered me to take a yoke of oxen and go to the village to bring home a cart which was there saying he would follow me He arrived at the village soon after I did and took his breakfast with his store-keeper He then told me to come into the house and get my breakfast Whilst I was eating in the kitchen I observed him talking earnestly but lowly to a stranger near the kitchen door I soon after went out and hitched my oxen to the cart and was about to drive off when several men came round about me and amongst them the stranger whom I had seen speaking with my master This man came up to me and seizing me by the collar shook me violently saying I was his property and must go with him to Georgia At the sound of these words the thoughts of my wife and children rushed across my mind and my heart died away within me I saw and knew that my case was hopeless and that resistance was vain as there were near twenty persons present all of whom were ready to assist the man by whom I was kidnapped I felt incapable of weeping or speaking and in my despair I laughed loudly My purchaser ordered me to cross my hands behind which were quickly bound with a strong cord and he then told me that we must set out that very day for the south I asked if I could not be allowed to go to see my wife and children or if this could not be permitted if they might not have leave to come to see me but was told that I would be able to get another wife in Georgia My new master whose name I did not hear took me that same day across the Patuxent where I joined fifty-one other slaves whom he had bought in Maryland Thirty-two of these were men and nineteen were women The women were merely tied together with a rope about the size of a bed cord which was tied like a halter round the neck of each but the men of whom I was the stoutest and strongest were very differently caparisoned A strong iron collar was closely fitted by means of a padlock round each of our necks A chain of iron about a hundred feet in length was passed through the hasp of each padlock except at the two ends where the hasps of the padlocks passed through a link of the chain In addition to this we were handcuffed in pairs with iron staples and bolts with a short chain about a foot long uniting the handcuffs and their wearers in pairs In this manner we were chained alternately by the right and left hand and the poor man to whom I was thus ironed wept like all infant when the blacksmith with his heavy hammer fastened the ends of the bolts that kept the staples from slipping from our arms For my own part I felt indifferent to my fate It appeared to me that the worst had come that could come and that no change of fortune could harm me After we were all chained and handcuffed together we sat down upon the ground and here reflecting upon the sad reverse of fortune that had so suddenly overtaken me and the dreadful suffering which awaited me I became weary of life and bitterly execrated the day I was born It seemed that I was destined by fate to drink the cup of sorrow to the very dregs and that I should find no respite from misery but in the grave I longed to die and escape from the hands of my tormentors but even the wretched privilege of destroying myself was denied me for I could not shake off my chains nor move a yard without the consent of my master Reflecting in silence upon my forlorn condition I at length concluded that as things could not become worse--and as the life of man is but a continued round of changes they must of necessity take a turn in my favour at some future day I found relief in this vague and indefinite hope and when we received orders to go on board the scow which was to transport us over the Patuxent I marched down to the water with a firmness of purpose of which I did not believe myself capable a few minutes before We were soon on the south side of the river and taking up our line of march we travelled about five miles that evening and stopped for the night at one of those miserable public houses so frequent in the lower parts of Maryland and Virginia called ordinaries Our master ordered a pot of mush to be made for our supper after despatching which we all lay down on the naked floor to steep in our handcuffs and chains The women my fellow-slaves lay on one side of the room and the men who were chained with me occupied the other I slept but little this night which I passed in thinking of my wife and little children whom I could not hope ever to see again I also thought of my grandfather and of the long nights I had passed with him listening to his narratives of the scenes through which he had passed in Africa I at length fell asleep but was distressed by painful dreams My wife and children appeared to be weeping and lamenting my calamity and beseeching and imploring my master on their knees not to carry me away from them My little boy came and begged me not to go and leave him and endeavoured as I thought with his little hands to break the fetters that bound me I awoke in agony and cursed my existence I could not pray for the measure of my woes seemed to be full and I felt as if there was no mercy in heaven nor compassion on earth for a man who was born a slave Day at length came and with the dawn we resumed our journey towards the Potomac As we passed along the road I saw the slaves at work in the corn and tobacco-fields I knew they toiled hard and lacked food but they were not like me dragged in chains from their wives children and friends Compared with me they were the happiest of mortals I almost envied them their blessed lot Before night we crossed the Potomac at Hoe's Ferry and bade farewell to Maryland At night we stopped at the house of a poor gentleman at least he appeared to wish my master to consider him a gentleman and he had no difficulty in establishing his claim to poverty He lived at the side of the road in a framed house which had never been plastered within--the weather-boards being the only wall He had about fifty acres of land enclosed by a fence the remains of a farm which had once covered two or three hundred acres but the cedar bushes had encroached upon all sides until the cultivation had been confined to its present limits The land was the very picture of sterility and there was neither barn nor stable on the place The owner was ragged and his wife and children were in a similar plight It was with difficulty that we obtained a bushel of corn which our master ordered us to parch at a fire made in the yard and to eat for our supper Even this miserable family possessed two slaves half-starved half-naked wretches whose appearance bespoke them familiar with hunger and victims of the lash but yet there was one pang which they had not known--they had not been chained and driven from their parents or children into hopeless exile We left this place early in the morning and directed our course toward the south-west our master riding beside us and hastening our march sometimes by words of encouragement and sometimes by threats of punishment The women took their place in the rear of our line We halted about nine o'clock for breakfast and received as much cornbread as we could eat together with a plate of broiled herrings and about three pounds of pork amongst us Before we left this place I was removed from near the middle of the chain and placed at the front end of it so that I now became the leader of the file and held this post of honour until our irons were taken from us near the town of Columbia in South Carolina We continued our route this day along the high road between the Potomac and Rappahannock and I several times saw each of those rivers before night Our master gave us no dinner to day but we halted a short time before sundown and got as much corn mush and sour milk as we could eat for supper It was now the beginning of the month of May and the weather in the fine climate of Virginia was very mild and pleasant so that our master was not obliged to provide us with fire at night From this time to the end of our journey southward we all slept promiscuously men and women on the floors of such houses as we chanced to stop at We had no clothes except those we wore and a few blankets the larger portion of our gang being in rags at the time we crossed the Potomac Two of the women were pregnant the one far advanced-- and she already complained of inability to keep pace with our march but her complaints were disregarded We crossed the Rappahannock at Port Royal and afterwards passed through the village of Bowling Green a place with which I became better acquainted in after times but which now presented the quiet so common to all the small towns in Virginia and indeed in all the southern states Time did not reconcile me to my chains but it made me familiar with them and in a few days the horrible sensations attendant upon my cruel separation from my wife and children in some measure subsided and I began to reflect upon my present hopeless and desperate situation with some degree of calmness hoping that I might be able to devise some means of escaping from the hands of my new master who seemed to place particular value on me as I could perceive from his conversation with such persons as we happened to meet at our resting places I heard him tell a tavern-keeper where we halted that if he had me in Georgia he could get five hundred dollars for me but he had bought me for his brother and he believed he would not sell me but in this he afterwards changed his opinion I examined every part of our long chain to see if there might not be some place in it at which it could be severed but found it so completely secured that with any means in my power its separation was impossible From this time I endeavoured to beguile my sorrows by examining the state of the country through which we were travelling and observing the condition of my fellow-slaves on the plantations along the high-road upon which we sojourned We all had as much corn bread as we could eat This was procured by our owner at the small dram shops or ordinaries at which we usually tarried all night In addition to this we generally received a salt herring though not every day On Sunday our master bought as much bacon as when divided amongst us gave about a quarter of a pound to each person in our gang In Calvert county where I was born the practice amongst slave-holders was to allow each slave one peck of corn weekly which was measured out every Monday morning at the same time each one receiving seven salt herrings This formed the week's provision and the master who did not give it was called a hard master whilst those who allowed their people any thing more were deemed kind and indulgent It often happened that the stock of salt herrings laid up by a master in the spring was not sufficient to enable him to continue this rate of distribution through the year and when the fish failed nothing more than the corn was dealt out On the other hand some planters who had large stocks of cattle and many cows kept the sour milk after all the cream had been skimmed from it and made a daily distribution of this amongst the working slaves Some who had large apple orchards gave their slaves a pint of cider each per day through the autumn It sometimes happened too in the lower counties of Maryland that there was an allowance of pork made to the slaves one day in each week though on some estates this did not take place more than once in a month This allowance of meat was disposed of in such a manner as to permit each slave to get a slice very often amounting to half a pound The slaves were also permitted to work for themselves at night and on Sunday If they chose to fish they had the privilege of selling whatever they caught Some expert fishermen caught and sold as many fish and oysters as enabled them to buy coffee sugar and other luxuries for their wives besides keeping themselves and their families in Sunday clothes for the masters in Maryland only allowed the men one wool hat one pair of shoes two shirts two pair of trousers-- one pair of tow cloth and one of woollen--and one woollen jacket in the year The women were furnished in proportion All other clothes they had to provide for themselves Children not able to work in the field were not provided with clothes at all by their masters It is however honourable to the Maryland slave-holders that they never permit women to go naked in the fields or about the house and if the men are industrious and employ themselves well on Sundays and holydays they can always keep themselves in comfortable clothes In Virginia it appeared to me that the slaves were more rigorously treated than they were in my native place It is easy to tell a man of colour who is poorly fed from one who is well supplied with food by his personal appearance A half-starved negro is a miserable looking creature His skin becomes dry and appears to be sprinkled over with whitish husks or scales the glossiness of his face vanishes his hair loses its colour becomes dry and when stricken with a rod the dust flies from it These signs of bad treatment I perceived to be very common in Virginia many young girls who would have been beautiful if they had been allowed enough to eat had lost all their prettiness through mere starvation their fine glossy hair had become of a reddish colour and stood out round their heads like long brown wool IV Our master at first expressed a determination to pass through the city of Richmond but for some reason which he did not make known to us he changed his mind and drove us up the country crossing the Matepony North Anna and South Anna rivers For several days we traversed a region which had been deserted by the occupants--being no longer worth culture--and immense thickets of young red cedars now occupied the fields in digging of which thousands of wretched slaves had worn out their lives in the service of merciless masters In some places these cedar thickets as they are called continued for three or four miles together without a house to enliven the scene and with scarcely an original forest tree to give variety to the landscape One day in the midst of a wilderness of cedars we came in view of a stately and venerable looking brick edifice which on nearer inspection I discovered to be a church On approaching it our driver ordered us to halt and dismounting from his horse tied him to a young cedar tree and sat himself down upon a flat tomb-stone near the west end of the church ordering us at the same time to sit down among the grass and rest ourselves The grave yard in which we were now encamped occupied about two acres of ground which was surrounded by a square brick wall much dilapidated and in many places broken down nearly to the ground The gates were decayed and gone but the gate-ways were yet distinct The whole enclosure was thickly strewed with graves many of which were surmounted by beautiful marble slabs others were designated by plain head and foot stones whilst far the larger number only betrayed the resting places of their sleeping tenant by the simple mounds of clay which still maintained their elevation above the level of the surrounding earth From the appearance of this burial place I suppose no one had been interred there for thirty years Several hollies planted by the hands of friendship grew amongst the hillocks and numerous flowering shrubs and bushes now in bloom gave fragrance to the air of the place The cedars which covered the surrounding plain with a forest impervious to the eye had respected this lonely dwelling of the dead and not one was to be seen within the walls Though it was now the meridian of day in spring the stillness of midnight pervaded the environs of this deserted and forsaken temple the pulpit pews and gallery of which were still standing as I could perceive through the broken door-way and maintained a freshness and newness of appearance little according with the time-worn aspect of the exterior scenery It was manifest that this earthly dwelling of the Most High now so desolate and ruinous was once the resort of a congregation of people gay fashionable and proud who had disappeared from the land leaving only this fallen edifice and these grassy tombs as the mementos of their existence They had passed away even as did the wandering red men who roamed through the lofty oak forests which once shaded the ground where we now lay As I sat musing upon the desolation that surrounded me my mind turned to the cause which had converted a former rich and populous country into the solitude of a deserted wilderness The ground over which we had travelled since we crossed the Potomac had generally been a strong reddish clay with an admixture of sand and was of the same quality with the soil of the counties of Chester Montgomery and Bucks in Pennsylvania It had originally been highly fertile and productive and had it been properly treated would doubtlessly have continued to yield abundant and prolific crops but the gentlemen who became the early proprietors of this fine region supplied themselves with slaves from Africa cleared large plantations of many thousands of acres--cultivated tobacco--and became suddenly wealthy built spacious houses and numerous churches such as this but regardless of their true interest they valued their lands less than their slaves exhausted the kindly soil by unremitting crops of tobacco declined in their circumstances and finally grew poor upon the very fields that had formerly made their possessors rich abandoned one portion after another as not worth planting any longer and pinched by necessity at last sold their slaves to Georgian planters to procure a subsistence and when all was gone took refuge in the wilds of Kentucky again to act the same melancholy drama leaving their native land to desolation and poverty The churches then followed the fate of their builders The revolutionary war deprived the parsons of their legal support and they fled from the altar which no longer maintained them Virginia has become poor by the folly and wickedness of slavery and dearly has she paid for the anguish and sufferings she has inflicted upon our injured degraded and fallen race After remaining about two hours in this place we again resumed our march and wretched as I was I felt relieved when we departed from this abode of the spirit of ruin We continued our course up the country westward for two or three days moving at a slow pace and at length turning south crossed James river at a place about thirty miles above Richmond as I understood at the time We continued our journey from day to day in a course and by roads which appeared to me to bear generally about south-west for more than four weeks in which time we entered South Carolina and in this state near Camden I first saw a field of cotton in bloom I had endeavoured through the whole journey from the time we crossed the Rappahannock river to make such observations upon the country the roads we travelled and the towns we passed through as would enable me at some future period to find my way back to Maryland I was particularly careful to note the names of the towns and villages through which we passed and to fix on my memory not only the names of all the rivers but also the position and bearing of the ferries over those streams After leaving James river I assumed an air of cheerfulness and even gaiety--I often told stories to my master of the manners and customs of the Maryland planters and asked him if the same usages prevailed in Georgia whither we were destined By repeatedly naming the rivers that we came to and in the order which we had reached them I was able at my arrival in Georgia to repeat the name of every considerable stream from the Potomac to the Savannah and to tell at what ferries we had crossed them I afterwards found this knowledge of great service to me indeed without it I should never have been able to extricate myself from slavery After leaving James river our road led us southwest through that region of country which in Virginia and the Carolinas they call the upper country It lies between the head of the tides in the great rivers and the lower ranges of the Alleghany Mountains I had at that time never seen a country cultivated by the labour of freemen and consequently was not able to institute any comparison between the southern plantations and the farms in Pennsylvania the fields of which are ploughed and reaped by the hands of their owners but my recollection of the general aspect of upper Virginia and Carolina is still vivid When contrasted with the exhausted and depopulated portion of Virginia lying below the head of the tide much of which I had seen the lands traversed by us in the month of May and early part of June were indeed fertile and beautiful but when compared with what the same plantations would have been in the hands of such farmers as I have seen in Pennsylvania divided into farms of the proper size the cause of the general poverty and weakness of the slave-holding states is at once seen The plantations are large in the south often including a thousand acres or more the population is consequently thin as only one white family beside the overseer ever resides on one plantation As I advanced southward even in Virginia I perceived that the state of cultivation became progressively worse Here as in Maryland the practice of the best farmers who cultivate grain of planting the land every alternate year in corn and sowing it in wheat or rye in the autumn of the same year in which the corn is planted and whilst the corn is yet standing in the field so as to get a crop from the same ground every year without allowing it time to rest or recover exhausts the finest soil in a few years and in one or two generations reduces the proprietors to poverty Some who are supposed to be very superior farmers only plant the land in corn once in three years sowing it in wheat or rye as in the former case however without any covering of clover or other grass to protect it from the rays of the sun The culture of tobacco prevails over a large portion of Virginia especially south of James river to the exclusion of almost every other crop except corn This destructive crop ruins the best land in a short time and in all the lower parts of Maryland and Virginia the traveller will see large old family mansions of weather-beaten and neglected appearance standing in the middle of vast fields of many hundred acres the fences of which have rotted away and have been replaced by a wattled work in place of a fence composed of short cedar stakes driven into the ground about two feet apart and standing about three feet above the earth the intervals being filled up by branches cut from the cedar trees and worked into the stakes horizontally after the manner of splits in a basket Many of these fields have been abandoned altogether and are overgrown by cedars which spring up in infinite numbers almost as soon as a field ceases to be ploughed and furnish materials for fencing such parts of the ancient plantation as are still kept enclosed In many places the enclosed fields are only partially cultivated all the hills and poorest parts being given up to the cedars and chinquopin bushes These estates the seats of families that were once powerful wealthy and proud are universally destitute of the appearance of a barn such as is known among the farmers of Pennsylvania The out houses stables gardens and offices have fallen to decay and the dwelling-house is occupied by the descendants of those who erected it still pertinaciously adhering to the halls of their ancestry with a half dozen or ten slaves the remains of the two or three hundred who toiled upon these grounds in former days The residue of the stock has been distributed in marriage portions to the daughters of the family gone to a distance--have been removed to the west by emigrating sons or have been sold to the southern traders from time to time to procure money to support the dignity of the house as the land grew poorer and the tobacco crop shorter from year to year Industry enterprise and ambition have fled from these abodes and sought refuge from sterility and barrenness in the vales of Kentucky or the plains of Alabama whilst the present occupants vain of their ancestral monuments and proud of an obscure name contend with all the ills that poverty brings upon fallen greatness and pass their lives in a contest between mimic state and actual penury--too ignorant of agriculture to know how to restore fertility to a once prolific and still substantial soil and too spiritless to sell their effects and search a new home under other skies The sedge grass every where takes possession of the worn out fields until it is supplanted by the chinquopin and the cedar This grass grows in thick set bunches or stools and no land is too poor for it It rises to the height of two or three feet and grows in many places in great profusion--is utterly worthless either for hay or pasturage but affords shelter to numerous rabbits and countless flocks of partridges and at a short distance has a beautiful appearance as its elastic blue tops wave in the breeze In Maryland and Virginia although the slaves are treated with so much rigour and oftentimes with so much cruelty I have seen instances of the greatest tenderness of feeling on the part of their owners I myself had three masters in Maryland and I cannot say now even after having resided so many years in a state where slavery is not tolerated that either of them except the last who sold me to the Georgians and was an unfeeling man used me worse than they had a moral right to do regarding me merely as an article of property and not entitled to any rights as a man political or civil My mistresses in Maryland were all good women and the mistress of my wife in whose kitchen I spent my Sundays and many of my nights for several years was a lady of most benevolent and kindly feelings She was a true friend to me and I shall always venerate her memory It is now my opinion after all I have seen that there are no better-hearted women in the world than the ladies of the ancient families as they are called in old Virginia or the country below the mountains and the same observations will apply to the ladies of Maryland The stock of slaves has belonged to the family for several generations and there is a kind of family pride in being the proprietors of so many human beings which in many instances borders on affection for people of colour If the proprietors of the soil in Maryland and Virginia were skilful cultivators--had their lands in good condition--and kept no more slaves on each estate than would be sufficient to work the soil in a proper manner and keep up the repairs of the place--the condition of the coloured people would not be by any means a comparatively unhappy one I am convinced that in nine cases in ten the hardships and sufferings of the coloured population of lower Virginia is attributable to the poverty and distress of its owners In many instances an estate scarcely yields enough to feed and clothe the slaves in a comfortable manner without allowing any thing for the support of the master and family but it is obvious that the family must first be supported and the slaves must be content with the surplus-- and this on a poor old worn out tobacco plantation is often very small and wholly inadequate to the comfortable sustenance of the hands as they are called There in many places nothing is allowed to the poor negro but his peck of corn per week without the sauce of a salt herring or even a little salt itself Wretched as may be the state of the negroes in the quarter that of the master and his wife and daughters is in many instances not much more enviable in the old apartments of the great house The sons and daughters of the family are gentlemen and ladies by birthright--and were the former to be seen at the plough or the latter at the churn or the wash tub the honour of the family would be stained and the dignity of the house degraded People must and will be employed about something and if they cannot be usefully occupied they will most surely engage in some pursuit wholly unprofitable So it happens in Virginia--the young men spend their time in riding about the country whilst they ought to be ploughing or harrowing in the cornfield and the young women are engaged in reading silly books or visiting their neighbours' houses instead of attending to the dairy or manufacturing cloth for themselves and their brothers During all this the father is too often defending himself against attorneys or making such terms as he can with the sheriff for debts in which he has been involved by the vicious idleness of his children and his own want of virtue and courage to break through the evil tyranny of old customs and compel his offspring to learn in early life to procure their subsistence by honest and honourable industry In this state of things there is not enough for all Pride forbids the sale of the slaves as long as it is possible to avoid it and their meagre allowance of corn is stinted rather than it shall be the master was obliged to sell them Somebody must suffer and self-preservation is the first law of nature says the proverb-- hunger must invade either the great house or the quarter and it is but reasonable to suppose that so unwelcome an intruder would be expelled to the last moment from the former In this conflict of pride and folly against industry and wisdom the slave-holders have been unhappily engaged for more than fifty years They are attempting to perform impossibilities-- to draw the means of supporting a life of idleness luxury and splendour from a once generous but long since worn out and exhausted soil--a soil which carefully used would at this day have richly repaid the toils of the husbandman by a noble abundance of all the comforts of life but which tortured into barrenness by the double curse of slavery and tobacco stands--and until its proprietors are regenerated and learn the difference between a land of slaves and a nation of freemen--must continue to stand a monument of the poverty and punishment which Providence has decreed as the reward of idleness and tyranny The general features of slavery are the same everywhere but the utmost rigour of the system is only to be met with on the cotton plantations of Carolina and Georgia or in the rice fields which skirt the deep swamps and morasses of the southern rivers In the tobacco fields of Maryland and Virginia great cruelties are practised-- not so frequently by the owners as by the overseers of the slaves but yet the tasks are not so excessive as in the cotton region nor is the press of labour so incessant throughout the year It is true that from the period when the tobacco plants are set in the field there is no resting time until it is housed but it is planted out about the first of May and must be cut and taken out of the field before the frost comes After it is hung and dried the labour of stripping and preparing it for the hogshead in leaf or of manufacturing it into twist is comparatively a work of leisure and ease Besides on almost every plantation the hands are able to complete the work of preparing the tobacco by January and sometimes earlier so that the winter months form some sort of respite from the toils of the year The people are obliged it is true to occupy themselves in cutting wood for the house making rails and repairing fences and in clearing new land to raise the tobacco plants for the next year but as there is usually time enough and to spare for the completion of all this work before the season arrives for setting the plants in the field the men are seldom flogged much unless they are very lazy or negligent and the women are allowed to remain in the house in very cold snowy or rainy weather I who am intimately acquainted with the slavery both of Maryland and Virginia and know that there is no material difference between the two aver that a description of one is a description of both and that the coloured people here have many advantages over those of the cotton region There are seldom more than one hundred of all ages and conditions kept on one tobacco plantation though there are sometimes many more but this is not frequent whilst on the cotton estates I have seen four or five hundred working together in the same vast field In Maryland the owners of the estates generally reside at home throughout the year and the mistress of the mansion is seldom absent more than a few weeks in the winter when she visits Baltimore or Washington-- the same is the case in Virginia Her constant residence on the estate makes her acquainted personally with all the slaves and she frequently interests herself in their welfare often interceding with the master her husband to prevent the overseer from beating them unmercifully The young ladies of the family also if there be any after they have left school are generally at home until they are married Each of them universally claims a young black girl as her own and takes her under her protection This enables the girl to extend the protection and friendship of her young mistress to her father mother brothers and sisters The sons of the family likewise have their favourites among the black boys and have many disputes with the overseer if he abuses them All these advantages accrue to the black people from the circumstance of the master and his family living at home In Maryland I never knew a mistress or a young mistress who would not listen to the complaints of the slaves It is true we were always obliged to approach the door of the mansion in the most humble and supplicating manner with our hats in our hands and the most subdued and beseeching language in our mouths--but in return we generally received words of kindness and very often a redress of our grievances though I have known very great ladies who would never grant any request from the plantation hands but always referred them and their petitions to their master under a pretence that they could not meddle with things that did not belong to the house The mistresses of the great families generally gave mild language to the slaves though they sometimes sent for the overseer and had them severely flogged but I have never heard any mistress in either Maryland or Virginia indulge in the low vulgar and profane vituperations of which I was myself the object in Georgia for several years whenever I came into the presence of my mistress Flogging--though often severe and excruciating in Maryland is not practised with the order regularity and system to which it is reduced in the south On the Potomac if a slave gives offence he is generally chastised on the spot in the field where he is at work as the overseer always carries a whip-- sometimes a twisted cow-hide sometimes a kind of horsewhip and very often a simple hickory switch or gad cut in the adjoining woods For stealing meat or other provisions or for any of the higher offences the slaves are stripped tied up by the hands--sometimes by the thumbs--and whipped at the quarter-- but many times on a large tobacco plantation there is not more than one of these regular whippings in a week--though on others where the master happens to be a bad man or a drunkard the back of the unhappy Maryland slave is seamed with scars from his neck to his hips It was my fortune whilst I was a slave in Maryland always to have comparatively mild masters and as I uniformly endeavoured to do whatever was held to be the duty of a good slave according to the customs of the country I was never tied up to be flogged there and never received a blow from my master after I was fifteen years old I was never under the control of an overseer in Maryland or it is very likely that I should not have been able to give this account of myself It is the custom of all the tobacco planters in Maryland and Virginia to plant a certain portion of their land in corn every year so much as they suppose will be sufficient to produce bread as they term it for the negroes By bread is understood a peck of corn per week for each of their slaves After my return from the navy-yard at Washington I was generally employed in the culture of tobacco but my attention was necessarily divided between the tobacco and the corn The corn crop is however only a matter of secondary consideration as no grain of any kind is grown for sale by the planters and if they raised as much in my time as supplied the wants of the people and the horses of the stable it was considered good farming The sale of the tobacco was regarded as the only means of obtaining money or any commodity which did not grow on the plantation It is unfortunate for the slaves that in a tobacco or cotton growing country no attention whatever is paid to the rearing of sheep--consequently there is no wool to make winter clothes for the people and oftentimes they suffer excessively from the cold whereas if their masters kept a good flock of sheep to supply them with wool they could easily spin and weave in their cabins a sufficiency of cloth to clothe them comfortably As many persons may be unacquainted with the process of cultivating tobacco a short account of the growth of this plant may not be uninteresting The operation is to be commenced in the month of February by clearing a piece of new land and burning the timber cut from it on the ground so as to form a coat of ashes over the whole space if possible This ground is then to be dug up with a hoe and the sticks and roots are to be carefully removed from it In this bed the tobacco seeds are sown about the beginning of March not in hills or in rows but by broad cast as in sowing turnips The seeds do not spring soon but generally the young plant appears early in April If the weather at the time the tobacco comes up as it is called is yet frosty a covering of pine tops or red cedar branches is thickly spread over the whole patch which consists of from one to four or five acres according to the dimensions of the plantation to be provided with plants As soon as the weather becomes fine and the young tobacco begins to grow the covering of the branches is removed and the bed is exposed to the rays of the sun From this time the patch must be carefully attended and kept clear of all grass and weeds In the months of March and April the people are busily employed in ploughing the fields in which the tobacco is to be planted in May Immediately after the corn is planted every one man woman and child able to work with a hoe or carry a tobacco plant is engaged in working up the whole plantation already ploughed a second time into hills about four feet apart laid out in regular rows across the field by the course of the furrows These hills are formed into squares or diamonds at equal distance both ways and into these are transplanted the tobacco plants from the beds in which the seeds were sown This transplantation must be done when the earth is wet with rain and it is best to do it if possible just before or at the time the rain falls as cabbages are transplanted in a kitchen garden but as the planting a field of one or two hundred acres with tobacco is not the work of an hour as soon as it is deemed certain that there will be a sufficient fall of rain to answer the purpose of planting out tobacco all hands are called to the tobacco field and no matter how fast it may rain or how violent the storm may be the removal of the plants from the bed and fixing them in the hills where they are to grow in the field goes on until the crop is planted out or the rain ceases and the sun begins to shine Nothing but the darkness of night and the short respite required by the scanty meal of the slaves produce any cessation in the labour of tobacco planting until the work is done or the rain ceases and the clouds disappear Some plants die under the operation of removal and their places are to be supplied from those left in the bed at the fall of the next rain Sometimes the tobacco worm appears amongst the plants before their removal from the bed and from the moment this loathsome reptile is seen the plants are to be carefully examined every day for the purpose of destroying any worms that may be found It is however not until the plants have been set in the field and have begun to grow and flourish that the worms come forth in their fall strength If unmolested they would totally destroy the largest field of tobacco in the months of June and July At this season of the year every slave that is able to kill a tobacco worm is kept in the field from morning until night Those who are able to work with hoes are engaged in weeding the tobacco and at the same time destroying all the worms they find The children do nothing but search for and destroy the worms All this labour and vigilance however would not suffice to keep the worms under were it not for the aid of turkeys and ducks On some large estates they raise from one to two hundred turkeys and as many ducks--not for the purpose of sale but for the destruction of tobacco worms The ducks live in the tobacco field day and night except when they go to water and as they are great gormandizers they take from the plants and destroy an infinite number of worms They are fond of them as an article of food and require no watching to keep them in their place but it is otherwise with the turkeys These require very peculiar treatment They must be kept all night in a large coop spacious enough to contain the whole flock with poles for them to roost on As soon as it is light in the morning the coop is opened the flock turned out and driven to the tobacco field Two hundred turkeys should be followed by four or five active lads or young men to keep them together and at their duty One turkey will destroy as many worms as five men could do in the same period of time but it seems that tobacco worm are not the natural food of turkeys and they are prone to break out of the field and escape to the woods or pastures in search of grasshoppers which they greatly prefer to tobacco worms for breakfast However if kept amongst the tobacco they commit terrible ravages amongst the worms and will eat until they are filled up to the throat When they cease eating worms they are to be driven back to the coop and shut up where they must have plenty of water and a peck of corn to a hundred turkeys If they get no corn and are forced to live on tobacco worms only they droop become sickly and would doubtlessly die In the evening they are again driven to the field and treated again in the same manner as in the morning The tobacco worm is of a bright green colour with a series of rings or circles round its body I have seen them as large as a man's longest finger I was never able to discover in what manner they originate They certainly do not change into a butterfly as some other worms do and I could never perceive that they deposite eggs anywhere I am of opinion that there is something in the very nature of the tobacco plant which produces these nauseous reptiles for they are too large when at full growth to be ranked with insects In the month of August the tobacco crop is laid by as it is termed which means that they cease working in the fields for the purpose of destroying the weeds and grass the plants having now become so large as not to be injured by the under vegetation Still however the worms continue their ravages and it is necessary to employ all hands in destroying them In this month also the tobacco is to be topped if it has not been done before When the plants have reached the height of two or three feet according to the goodness of the soil and the vigour of the growth the top is to be cut off to prevent it from going to seed This topping causes all the powers of the plant which would be exhausted in the formation of flowers and seeds to expand in leaves fit for use After the tobacco is fully grown which in some plants happens early in August it is to be carefully watched to see when it is ripe or fit for cutting The state of the plant is known by its colour and by certain pale spots which appear on the leaves It does not all arrive at maturity at the same time and although some plants ripen early in August others are not ripe before the middle of September When the plants are cut down they are laid on the ground for a short time then taken up and the stalks split open to facilitate the drying of the leaves In this condition it is removed to the drying house and there hung up under sheds until it is fully dry From thence it is removed into the tobacco house and laid up in bulk ready for stripping and manufacturing V It is time to resume the narrative of my journey southward At the period of which I now write tobacco was universally cultivated in those parts of Virginia through which I travelled and that with the corn crops constituted nearly the whole objects of agricultural labour The quantity of wheat and rye which I saw on my journey was very small A little oats was growing on the estates of some gentlemen who were fond of breeding fine horses I did not perceive any material difference in the condition of the country as I passed south until after crossing the Roanoke river Near this stream we passed a very large estate on which there appeared to me to be nearly a thousand acres of tobacco growing Our master was informed by a gentleman whom we met here that this property belonged to Mr Randolph a member of Congress and one of the largest planters in Virginia The land appeared to me not to be any better than the tobacco lands in Maryland though a little more sandy The mansion house was low and of ordinary appearance The fields were badly fenced and the whole place was in poor condition We passed close by a gang of near a hundred hands--men and women at work with hoes in a tobacco field I had not in all Virginia seen any slaves more destitute of clothes Many of the men and some of the young women were without shirts and several young lads had only a few rags about their loins Their skins looked dry and husky which proved that they were not well fed They were followed by an overseer who carried in his hand a kind of whip which I had never before seen though I afterward became familiar with this terrible weapon South of the Roanoke the land became more sandy and pine timber generally prevailed--in many places to the exclusion of all other trees In North Carolina the same course of culture is pursued as that which I have noted in Virginia and the same disastrous consequences result from it though as the country has not been settled so long as the northern part of Virginia and Maryland so great a portion of the land has not been worn out and abandoned in the former as in the latter Here also the red cedar is seldom seen as the pitch-pine takes possession of all waste and deserted fields In this state the houses are not so well built as they are further north there are fewer carriages and the number of good horses judging from those I saw on the road must be much less The inhabitants of the country are plainer in their dress and they have fewer people of fashion than are to be met in Virginia The plantations here were not so large as those I saw on the north of the Roanoke but larger tracts of country are covered with wood than any I had heretofore seen The condition of the slaves is not worse here than it is in Virginia nor is there any wheat in Carolina worth speaking of As we approached the Yadkin river the tobacco disappeared from the fields and the cotton plant took its place as an article of general culture We passed the Yadkin by a ferry on Sunday morning and on the Wednesday following in the evening our master told us we were in the state of South Carolina We staid this night in a small town called Lancaster and I shall never forget the sensations which I experienced this evening on finding myself in chains in the state of South Carolina From my earliest recollections the name of South Carolina had been little less terrible to me than that of the bottomless pit In Maryland it had always been the practice of masters and mistresses who wished to terrify their slaves to threaten to sell them to South Carolina where it was represented that their condition would be a hundred fold worse than it was in Maryland I had regarded such a sale of myself as the greatest of evils that could befall me and had striven to demean myself in such manner to my owners as to preclude them from all excuse for transporting me to so horrid a place At length I found myself without having committed any crime or even the slightest transgression in the place and condition of which I had through life entertained the greatest dread I slept but little this night and for the first time felt weary of life It appeared to me that the cup of my misery was full-- that there was no hope of release from my present chains unless it might be to exchange them for the long lash of the ov rseers of the cotton plantations in each of whose hands I observed such a whip as I saw in possession of Mr Randolph's slave driver in Virginia I seriously meditated on self-destruction and had I been at liberty to get a rope I believe I should have hanged myself at Lancaster It appeared to me that such an act done by a man in my situation could not be a violation of the precepts of religion nor of the laws of God I had now no hope of ever again seeing my wife and children or of revisiting the scenes of my youth I apprehended that I should if I lived suffer the most excruciating pangs that extreme and long continued hunger could inflict for I had often heard that in South Carolina the slaves were compelled in times of scarcity to live on cotton seeds From the dreadful apprehensions of future evil which harrassed and harrowed my mind that night I do not marvel that the slaves who are driven to the south often destroy themselves Self-destruction is much more frequent among the slaves in the cotton region than is generally supposed When a negro kills himself the master is unwilling to let it be known lest the deed should be attributed to his own cruelty A certain degree of disgrace falls upon the master whose slave has committed suicide--and the same man who would stand by and see his overseer give his slave a hundred lashes with the long whip on his bare back without manifesting the least pity for the sufferings of the poor tortured wretch will express very profound regret if the same slave terminates his own life to avoid a repetition of the horrid flogging Suicide amongst the slaves is regarded as a matter of dangerous example and one which it is the business and the interest of all proprietors to discountenance and prevent All the arguments which can be devised against it are used to deter the negroes from the perpetration of it and such as take this dreadful means of freeing themselves from their miseries are always branded in reputation after death as the worst of criminals and their bodies are not allowed the small portion of Christian rites which are awarded to the corpses of other slaves Surely if any thing can justify a man in taking his life into his own hands and terminating his existence no one can attach blame to the slaves on many of the cotton plantations of the south when they cut short their breath and the agonies of the present being by a single stroke What is life worth amidst hunger nakedness and excessive toil under the continually uplifted lash It was long after midnight before I fell asleep but the most pleasant dreams succeeded to these sorrowful forebodings I thought I had by some means escaped from my master and through infinite and unparalleled dangers and sufferings had made my way back to Maryland and was again in the cabin of my wife with two of my little children on my lap whilst their mother was busy in preparing for me a supper of fried fish such as she often dressed when I was at home and had taken to her the fish I had caught in the Patuxent river Every object was so vividly impressed upon my imagination in this dream that when I awoke a firm conviction settled upon my mind that by some means at present incomprehensible to me I should yet again embrace my wife and caress my children in their humble dwelling Early in the morning our master called us up and distributed to each of the party a cake made of corn meal and a small piece of bacon On our journey we had only eaten twice a day and had not received breakfast until about nine o'clock but he this morning meal was given to welcome us to South Carolina He then addressed us all and told us we might now give up all hope of ever returning to the places of our nativity as it would be impossible for us to pass through the states of North Carolina and Virginia without being taken up and sent back He further advised us to make ourselves contented as he would take us to Georgia a far better country than any we had seen and where we would be able to live in the greatest abundance About sunrise we took up our march on the road to Columbia as we were told Hitherto our master had not offered to sell any of us and had even refused to stop to talk to any one on the subject of our sale although he had several times been addressed on this point before we reached Lancaster but soon after we departed from this village we were overtaken on the road by a man on horseback who accosted our driver by asking him if his niggers were for sale The latter replied that he believed he would not sell any yet as he was on his way to Georgia and cotton being now much in demand he expected to obtain high prices for us from persons who were going to settle in the new purchase He however contrary to his custom ordered us to stop and told the stranger he might look at us and that he would find us as fine a lot of hands as were ever imported into the country--that we were all prime property and he had no doubt would command his own prices in Georgia The stranger who was a thin weather-beaten sun-burned figure then he wanted a couple of breeding-wenches and would give as much for them as they would bring in Georgia--that he had lately heard from Augusta and that niggers were not higher there than in Columbia and as he had been in Columbia the week before he knew what niggers were worth He then walked along our line as we stood chained together and looked at the whole of us--then turning to the women asked the prices of the two pregnant ones Our master replied that these were two of the best breeding-wenches in all Maryland--that one was twenty-two and the other only nineteen--that the first was already the mother of seven children and the other of four--that he had himself seen the children at the time he bought their mothers--and that such wenches would be cheap at a thousand dollars each but as they were not able to keep up with the gang he would take twelve hundred dollars for the two The purchaser this was too much but that he would give nine hundred dollars for the pair This price was promptly refused but our master after some consideration he was willing to sell a bargain in these wenches and would take eleven hundred dollars for them which was objected to on the other side and many faults and failings were pointed out in the merchandise After much bargaining and many gross jests on the part of the stranger he offered a thousand dollars for the two and he would give no more He then mounted his horse and moved off but after he had gone about one hundred yards he was called back and our master if he would go with him to the next blacksmith's shop on the road to Columbia and pay for taking the irons off the rest of us he might have the two women This proposal was agreed to and as it was now about nine o'clock we were ordered to hasten on to the next house where we were told we must stop for breakfast At this place we were informed that it was ten miles to the next smith's shop and our new acquaintance was obliged by the terms of his contract to accompany us thither We received for breakfast about a pint of boiled rice to each person and after this was despatched we again took to the road eager to reach the blacksmith's shop at which we expected to be relieved of the iron rings and chains which had so long galled and worried us About two o'clock we arrived at the longed-for residence of the smith but on inquiry our master was informed that he was not at home and would not return before evening Here a controversy arose whether we should all remain here until the smith returned or the stranger should go on with us to the next smithery which was to be only five miles distant This was a point not easily settled between two such spirits as our master and the stranger both of whom had been overseers in their time and both of whom had risen to the rank of proprietors of slaves The matter had already produced angry words and much vaunting on the part of the stranger-- that a freeman of South Carolina was not to be imposed upon that by the constitution of the state his rights were sacred and he was not to be deprived of his liberty at the arbitrary will of a man just from amongst the Yankees and who had brought with him to the south as many Yankee tricks as he had niggers and he believed many more He then swore that all the niggers in the drove were Yankee niggers When I overseed for Colonel Polk he on his rice plantation he had two Yankee niggers that he brought from Maryland and they were running away every day I gave them a hundred lashes more than a dozen times but they never quit running away till I chained them together with iron collars round their necks and chained them to spades and made them do nothing but dig ditches to drain the rice swamps They could not run away then unless they went together and carried their chains and spades with them I kept them in this way two years and better niggers I never had One of them died one night and the other was never good for any thing after he lost his mate He never ran away afterwards but he died too after a while He then addressed himself to the two women whose master he had become and told them that if ever they ran away he would treat them in the same way Wretched as I was myself my heart bled for these poor creatures who had fallen into the hands of a tiger in human form The dispute between the two masters was still raging when unexpectedly the blacksmith rode up to his house on a thin bony-looking horse and dismounting asked his wife what these gentlemen were making such a frolick about I did not hear her answer but both the disputants turned and addressed themselves to the smith--the one to know what price he would demand to take the irons off all these niggers and the other to know how long it would take him to perform the work It is here proper for me to observe that there are many phrases of language in common use in Carolina and Georgia which are applied in a way that would not be understood by persons from one of the northern states For instance when several persons are quarrelling brawling making a great noise or even fighting they say the gentlemen are frolicking I heard many other terms equally strange whilst I resided in the southern country amongst such white people as I became acquainted with though my acquaintance was confined in a great measure to overseers and such people as did not associate with the rich planters and great families The smith at length agreed to take the irons from the whole of us for two dollars and fifty cents and immediately set about it with the air of indifference that he would have manifested in tearing a pair of old shoes from the hoofs of a wagon-horse It was four weeks and five days from the time my irons had been riveted upon me until they were removed and great as had been my sufferings whilst chained to my fellow-slaves I cannot say that I felt any pleasure in being released from my long confinement for I knew that my liberation was only preparatory to my final and as I feared perpetual subjugation to the power of some such monster as the one then before me who was preparing to drive away the two unfortunate women whom he had purchased and whose life's-blood he had acquired the power of shedding at pleasure for the sum of a thousand dollars After we were released from our chains our master sold the whole lot of irons which we had borne from Maryland to the blacksmith for seven dollars The smith then procured a bottle of rum and treated his two new acquaintances to a part of its contents--wishing them both good luck with their niggers After these civilities were over the two women were ordered to follow their new master who shaped his course across the country by a road leading westward At parting from us they both wept aloud and wrung their hands in despair We all went to them and bade them a last farewell Their road led into a wood which they soon entered and I never saw them nor heard of them again These women had both been driven from Calvert county as well as myself and the fate of the younger of the two was peculiarly severe She had been brought up as the waiting-maid of a young lady the daughter of a gentleman whose wife and family often visited the mistress of my own wife I had frequently seen this woman when she was a young girl in attendance upon her young mistress and riding in the same carriage with her The father of the young lady died and soon after she married a gentleman who resided a few miles off The husband received a considerable fortune with his bride and amongst other things her waiting-maid who was reputed a great beauty among people of colour He had been addicted to the fashionable sports of the country before marriage such as horse-racing fox-hunting c and I had heard the black people say he drank too freely but it was supposed that he would correct all these irregularities after marriage more especially as his wife was a great belle and withal very handsome The reverse however turned out to be the fact Instead of growing better he became worse and in the course of a few years was known all over the country as a drunkard and a gambler His wife it was died of grief and soon after her death his effects were seized by his creditors and sold by the sheriff The former waiting-maid now the mother of several children was purchased by our present master for three hundred dollars at the sheriff's sale and this poor wretch whose employment in early life had been to take care of her young mistress and attend her in her chamber and at her toilet after being torn from her husband and her children had now gone to toil out a horrible existence beneath the scorching sun of a South Carolina cotton field under the dominion of a master as void of the manners of a gentleman as he was of the language of humanity It was now late in the afternoon but as we had made little progress to-day and were now divested of the burden of our chains as well as freed from the two women who had hitherto much retarded our march our master ordered us to hasten on our way as we had ten miles to go that evening I had been so long oppressed by the weight of my chains and the iron collar about my neck that for some time after I commenced walking at my natural liberty I felt a kind of giddiness or lightness of the head Most of my companions complained of the same sensation and we did not recover our proper feelings until after we had slept one night It was after dark when we arrived at our lodging-place which proved to be the house of a small cotton-planter who it appeared kept a sort of a house of entertainment for travellers contrary to what I afterwards discovered to be the usual custom of cotton-planters This man and my master had known each other before and seemed to be well acquainted He was the first person that we had met since leaving Maryland who was known to my master and as they kept up a very free conversation through the course of the evening and the house in which they were was only separated from the kitchen in which we were lodged by a space of a few feet I had an opportunity of hearing much that was highly interesting to me The landlord after supper came with our master to look at us and to see us receive our allowance of boiled rice from the hands of a couple of black women who had prepared it in a large iron kettle Whilst viewing us the former asked the latter what he intended to do with his drove but no reply was made to this inquiry--and as our master had through our whole journey maintained a studied silence on this subject I felt a great curiosity to know what disposition he intended to make of the whole gang and of myself in particular On their return to the house I advanced to a small window in the kitchen which brought me within a few yards of the place where they sat and from which I was able to hear all they although they spoke in a low tone of voice I here learned that so many of us as could be sold for a good price were to be disposed of in Columbia on our arrival at that place and that the residue would be driven to Augusta and sold there The landlord assured my master that at this time slaves were much in demand both in Columbia and Augusta that purchasers were numerous and prices good and that the best plan of effecting good sales would be to put up each nigger separately at auction after giving a few days' notice by an advertisement in the neighbouring country Cotton he had not been higher for many years and as a great many persons especially young men were moving off to the new purchase in Georgia prime hands were in high demand for the purpose of clearing the land in the new country--that the boys and girls under twenty would bring almost any price at present in Columbia for the purpose of picking the growing crop of cotton which promised to be very heavy and as most persons had planted more than their hands would be able to pick young niggers who would soon learn to pick cotton were prime articles in the market As to those more advanced in life he seemed to think the prospect of selling them at an unusual price not so good as they could not so readily become expert cotton-pickers-- he further that from some cause which he could not comprehend the price of rice had not been so good this year as usual and that he had found it cheaper to purchase rice to feed his own niggers than to provide them with corn which had to be brought from the upper country He therefore advised my master not to drive us towards the rice plantation of the low country My master he would follow his advice at least so far as to sell a portion of us in Carolina but seemed to be of opinion that his prime hands would bring him more money in Georgia and named me in particular as one who would be worth at least a thousand dollars to a man who was about making a settlement and clearing a plantation in the new purchase I therefore concluded that in the course of events I was likely to become the property of a Georgian which turned out in the end to be the case though not so soon as I at this time apprehended I slept but little this night feeling a restlessness when no longer in chains and pondering over the future lot of my life which appeared fraught only with evil and misfortune Day at length dawned and with its first light we were ordered to betake ourselves to the road which we were told would lead us to Columbia the place of intended sale of some if not all of us For several days past I had observed that in the country through which we travelled little attention was paid to the cultivation of any thing but cotton Now this plant was almost the sole possessor of the fields It covered the plantations adjacent to the road as far as I could see both before and behind me and looked not unlike buckwheat before it blossoms I saw some small fields of corn and lots of sweet potatoes amongst which the young vines of the water-melon were frequently visible The improvements on the plantations were not good There were no barns but only stables and sheds to put the cotton under as it was brought from the field Hay seemed to be unknown in the country for I saw neither hay-stacks nor meadows and the few fields that were lying fallow had but small numbers of cattle in them and these were thin and meagre We had met with no flocks of sheep of late and the hogs that we saw on the road-side were in bad condition The horses and mules that I saw at work in the cotton-fields were poor and badly harnessed and the half-naked condition of the negroes who drove them or followed with the hoe together with their wan complexions proved to me that they had too much work or not enough food We passed a cotton-gin this morning the first that I ever saw but they were not at work with it We also met a party of ladies and gentlemen on a journey of pleasure riding in two very handsome carriages drawn by sleek and spirited horses very different in appearance from the moving skeletons that I had noticed drawing the ploughs in the fields The black drivers of the coaches were neatly clad in gay-coloured clothes and contrasted well with their half-naked brethren a gang of whom were hoeing cotton by the road-side near them attended by an overseer in a white linen shirt and pantaloons with one of the long negro whips in his hand I observed that these poor people did not raise their heads to look either at the fine coaches and horses then passing or at us but kept their faces steadily bent towards the cotton-plants from among which they were removing the weeds I almost shuddered at the sight knowing that I myself was doomed to a state of servitude equally cruel and debasing unless by some unforeseen occurrence I might fail into the hands of a master of less inhumanity of temper than the one who had possession of the miserable creatures before me VI It was manifest that I was now in a country where the life of a black man was no more regarded than that of an ox except as far as the man was worth the more money in the market On all the plantations that we passed there was a want of live stock of every description except slaves and they wore deplorably abundant The fields were destitute of every thing that deserved the name of grass and not a spear of clover was anywhere visible The few cattle that existed were browsing on the boughs of the trees in the woods Every thing betrayed a scarcity of the means of supplying the slaves who cultivated the vast cotton-fields with a sufficiency of food We travelled this day more than thirty miles and crossed the Catawba river in the afternoon on the bottoms of which I saw for the first time fields of rice growing in swamps covered with water Causeways were raised through the low-lands in which the rice grew and on these the road was formed on which we travelled These rice-fields or rather swamps had in my eyes a beautiful appearance The rice was nearly two feet in height above the water and of a vivid green colour covering a large space of at least a hundred acres Had it not been for the water which appeared stagnant and sickly and swarmed with frogs and thousands of snakes it would have been as fine a sight as one need wish to took upon After leaving the low grounds along the river we again entered plantations of cotton which lined the roads on both sides relieved here and there by corn-fields and potato-patches We stopped for the night at a small tavern and our master we were within a day's journey of Columbia We here again received boiled rice for supper without salt or any kind of seasoning a pint was allotted to each person which we greedily devoured having had no dinner to-day save an allowance of corn-cakes with the fat of about five pounds of bacon extracted by frying in which we dipped our bread I slept soundly after this day's march the fatigues of the body having for once overcome the agitations of the mind The next day which was if my recollection is accurate the ninth of June was the last of our journey before our company separated and we were on the road before the stars had disappeared from the sky Our breakfast this morning consisted of bacon soup a dish composed of corn meal boiled in water with a small piece of bacon to give the soup a taste of meat For dinner we had boiled Indian peas with a small allowance of bacon This was the first time that we had received two rations of meat in the same day on the whole journey and some of our party were much surprised at the kindness of our master but I had no doubt that his object was to make us look fat and hearty to enable him to obtain better prices for us at Columbia At supper this night we had corn mush in large wooden trays with melted lard to dip the mush in before eating it We might have reached Columbia this day if we had continued our march but we stopped at least an hour before sun-set about three miles from town at the house of a man who supported the double character of planter and keeper of a house of entertainment for I learned from his slaves that their master considered it disreputable to be called a tavern-keeper and would not put up a sign although he received pay of such persons as lodged with him His house was a frame building weather-boarded with pine boards but had no plastering within The furniture corresponded with the house which contained it and was both scanty and mean consisting of pine tables and wooden chairs with bottoms made of corn husks The house was only one story high and all the rooms six or seven in number parlour bed-rooms and kitchen were on the first floor As the weather was warm and the windows open I had an opportunity of looking into the sleeping rooms of the family as I walked round the house which I was permitted freely to do The beds and their furniture answered well to the chairs and tables yet in the large front room I observed on an old fashioned side-board a great quantity of glass ware of various descriptions with two or three dozen silver spoons a silver tea urn and several knives and forks with silver handles In the corner of this room stood a bed with gaudy red curtains with figures of lions elephants naked negroes and other representations of African scenery The master of the house was not at home when we arrived but came in from the field shortly afterwards He met my master with the cordiality of an old friend though he had never seen him before he was happy to see him at his house and that the greatest pleasure he enjoyed was derived from the entertainment of such gentlemen as thought proper to visit his house that he was always glad to see strangers and more especially gentlemen who were adding so much to the wealth and population of Carolina as those merchants who imported servants from the north He then observed that he had never seen a finer lot of property pass his house than we were and that any gentleman who brought such a stock of hands into the country was a public benefactor and entitled to the respect and gratitude of every friend of the south He assured my master that he was happy to see him at his house and that if he thought proper to remain a few days with him it would be his chief business to introduce him to the gentlemen of the neighbourhood who would all be glad to become acquainted with a merchant of his respectability In the state of Maryland my master had been called a negro buyer or Georgia trader sometimes a negro driver but here I found that he was elevated to the rank of merchant and a merchant of the first order too for it was very clear that in the opinion of the landlord no branch of trade was more honourable than the traffic in us poor slaves Our master observed that he had a mind to remain here a short time and try what kind of market Columbia would present for the sale of his lot of servants and that he would make this house his home until he had ascertained what could be done in town and what demand there was in the neighbourhood for servants We were not called slaves by these men who talked of selling us and of the price we would bring with as little compunction of conscience as they would have talked of the sale of so many mules It is the custom throughout all the slave-holding states amongst people of fashion never to speak of their negroes as slaves but always as servants but I had never before met with the keeper of a public house in the country who had arrived at this degree of refinement I had been accustomed to hear this order of men and indeed the greater number of white people speak of the people of colour as niggers We remained at this place more than two weeks I presume because my master found it cheaper to keep us here than in town or perhaps because he supposed we might recover from the hardships of our journey more speedily in the country As it was here that my real acquaintance with South Carolina commenced I have noted with more particularity the incidents that occurred than I otherwise should have done This family was composed of the husband wife three daughters all young women and two sons one of whom appeared to be about twenty and the other perhaps seventeen years old They had nine slaves in all one very old man quite crooked with years and labour--two men of middle age--one lad perhaps sixteen--one woman with three children the oldest about seven--and a young girl of twelve or fourteen The farm or plantation they lived on contained about one hundred and fifty acres of cleared land sandy and the greater part of it poor as was proved by the stinted growth of the cotton At the time of our arrival at this house I saw no persons about it except the four ladies--the mother and her three daughters--the husband being in the field as noticed above According to the orders of my master I had taken the saddle from his horse and put him in a stable and it was not until after the first salutations of the new landlord to my master were over that he seemed to think of asking him whether he had come on foot on horse-back or in a coach He at length however turned suddenly and asked him with an air of surprise where he had left his horses and carriage My master he had no carriage that he travelled on horseback and that his horse was in the stable The landlord then apologized for the trouble he must have had in having his horse put away himself and that at this season of the year the planters were so hurried by their crops and found so much difficulty in keeping down the grass that they were generally obliged to keep all their servants in the field that for his part he had been compelled to put his coachman and even the waiting-maids of his daughters into the cotton fields and that at this time his family were without servants a circumstance that had never happened before For my part he I have always prided myself on bringing up my family well and can say that although I do not live in so fine a house as some of the other planters of Carolina yet my children are as great ladies and gentlemen as any in the state Not one of them has ever had to do a day's work yet and as long as I live never shall I sent two of my daughters to Charleston last summer and they were there three months and I intend to send the youngest there this summer They have all learned to dance here in Columbia where I sent them two quarters to a Frenchman and he made me pay pretty well for it They went to the same dancing school with the daughters of Wade Hampton and Colonel Fitzhugh I am determined that they shall never marry any but gentlemen of the first character and I know they will always follow my advice in matters of this kind They are prudent and sensible girls and are not going to do as Major Pollack's daughter did this spring who ran away with a Georgia cracker who brought a drove of cattle for sale from the Indian country and who had not a nigger in the world He staid with me sometime and wished to have something to say to my second daughter but the thing would not do Here he stopped short in his narrative and seeming to muse a moment to his guest I presume as you travel alone you have no family No replied my master I am a single man I thought so by your appearance the loquacious landlord and I shall be glad to introduce you to my family this evening My sons are two as fine fellows as there are in all Carolina My oldest boy is lieutenant in the militia and in the same company that marched with Gen Marion in the war He was on the point of fighting a duel last winter with young M'Corkle in Columbia but the matter was settled between them You will see him this evening when he returns from the coit-party A coit-party of young bucks meets once every week about two miles from this and as I wish my sons to keep the best company they both attend it There is to be a cock-fight there this afternoon and my youngest son Edmund has the finest cock in this country He is of the true game blood--the real Dominica game breed and I sent to Charleston for his gaffs There is a bet of ten dollars a side between my son's cock and one belonging to young Blainey the son of Major Blainey Young Blainey is a hot-headed young blood and has been concerned in three duels though I believe he never fought but one but I know Edmund will not take a word from him and it will be well if he and his cock do not both get well licked Here the conversation was arrested by the sound of horses' feet on the road and in the next instant two young men rode up at a gallop mounted on lean looking horses one of the riders carrying a pole on his shoulder with a game cock in a net bag tied to one end of it On perceiving them the landlord exclaimed with an oath There's two lads of spirit stranger--and if you will allow me the liberty of asking you your name I will introduce you to them At the suggestion of his name my master seemed to hesitate a little but after a moment's pause They call me M'Giffin sir My name is Hulig sir replied the landlord and I am very happy to be acquainted with you Mr M'Giffin at the same time shaking him by the hand and introducing his two sons who were by this time at the door This was the first time I had ever heard the name of my master although I had been with him five weeks I had never seen him before the day on which he seized and bound me in Maryland and as he took me away immediately I did not hear his name at the time The people who assisted to fetter me either from accident or design omitted to name him and after we commenced our journey he had maintained so much distant reserve and austerity of manner towards us all that no one ventured to ask him his name We had called him nothing but master and the various persons at whose houses we had stopped on our way knew as little of his name as we did We had frequently been asked the name of our master and perhaps had not always obtained credence when we we did not know it Throughout the whole journey until after we were released from our irons he had forbidden us to converse together beyond a few words in relation to our temporary condition and wants and as he was with us all day and never slept out of hearing of us at night he rigidly enforced his edict of silence I presume that the reason of this prohibition of all conversation was to prevent us from devising plans of escape but he had imposed as rigid a silence on himself as was enforced upon us and after having passed from Maryland to South Carolina in his company I knew no more of my master than that he knew how to keep his secrets guard his slaves and make a close bargain I had never heard him speak of his home or family and therefore had concluded that he was an unmarried man and an adventurer who felt no more attachment for one place than another and whose residence was not very well settled but from the large sums of money which he must have been able to command and carry with him to the north to enable him to purchase so large a number of slaves I had no doubt that he was a man of consequence and consideration in the place from whence he came In Maryland I had always observed that men who were the owners of large stocks of negroes were not averse to having publicity given to their names and that the possession of this species of property even there gave its owner more vanity and egotism than fell to the lot of the holders of any other kind of estate and in truth my subsequent experience proved that without the possession of slaves no man could ever arrive at or hope to rise to any honourable station in society--yet my master seemed to take no pride in having at his disposal the lives of so many human beings He never spoke to us in words of either pity or hatred and never spoke of us except to order us to be fed or watered as he would have directed the same offices to be performed for so many horses or to inquire where the best prices could be obtained for us He regarded us only as objects of traffic and the materials of his commerce and although he had lived several years in Carolina and Georgia and had there exercised the profession of an overseer he regarded the southern planters as no less the subjects of trade and speculation than the slaves he sold to them as will appear in the sequal It was to this man that the landlord introduced his two sons and upon whom he was endeavouring to impose a belief that he was the head of a family which took rank with those of the first planters of the district The ladies of the household though I had seen them in the kitchen when I walked round the house had not yet presented themselves to my master nor indeed were they in a condition to be seen anywhere but in the apartment they occupied at the time The young gentlemen gave a very gasconading account of the coit-party and cock-fight from which they had just returned and according to their version of the affair it might have been an assemblage of at least half the military officers of the state for all the persons of whom they spoke were captains majors and colonels The eldest he had won two bowls of punch at coits and the youngest whose cock had been victor in the battle on which ten dollars were staked vaunted much of the qualities of his bird and supported his veracity by numerous oaths and reiterated appeals to his brother for the truth of his assertions Both these young men were so much intoxicated that they with difficulty maintained an erect posture in walking By this time the sun was going down and I observed two female slaves a woman and girl approaching the house on the side of the kitchen from the cotton field They were coming home to prepare supper for the family the ladies whom I had seen in the kitchen not having been there for the purpose of performing the duties appropriate to that station but having sought it as a place of refuge from the sight of my master who had approached the front of their dwelling silently and so suddenly as not to permit them to gain the foot of the stairway in the large front room without being seen by him to whose view they by no means wished to expose themselves before they had visited their toilets About dark the supper was ready in the large room and as it had two fronts one of which looked into the yard where my companions and I had been permitted to seat ourselves and had an opportunity of seeing by the light of the candle all that was done within and of hearing all that was The ladies four in number had entered the room before the gentlemen and when the latter came in my master was introduced by the landlord to his wife and daughters by the name and title of Colonel M'Giffin which at that time impressed me with a belief that he was really an officer and that he had disclosed this circumstance without my knowledge but I afterwards perceived that in the south it is deemed respectful to address a stranger by the title of Colonel or Major or General if his appearance will warrant the association of so high a rank with his name My master had declared his intention of becoming the inmate of this family for some time and no pains seemed to be spared on their part to impress upon his mind the high opinion that they entertained of the dignity of the owner of fifty slaves the possession of so large a number of human creatures being in Carolina a certificate of character which entitles its bearer to enter whatever society he may choose to select without any thing more being known of his birth his life or reputation The man who owns fifty servants must needs be a gentleman amongst the higher ranks and the owner of half a hundred niggers is a sort of nobleman amongst the low the ignorant and the vulgar The mother and three daughters whose appearance when I saw them in the kitchen would have warranted the conclusion that they had just risen from bed without having time to adjust their dress were now gaily if not neatly attired and the two female slaves who had come from the field at sundown to cook the supper now waited at the table The landlord talked much of his crops his plantation and slaves and of the distinguished families who exchanged visits with his own but my master took very little part in the conversation of the evening and appeared disposed to maintain the air of mystery which had hitherto invested his character After it was quite dark the slaves came in from the cotton-field and taking little notice of us went into the kitchen and each taking thence a pint of corn proceeded to a little mill which was nailed to a post in the yard and there commenced the operation of grinding meal for their suppers which were afterwards to be prepared by baking the meal into cakes at the fire The woman who was the mother of the three small children was permitted to grind her allowance of corn first and after her came the old man and the others in succession After the corn was converted into meal each one kneaded it up with cold water into a thick dough and raking away the ashes from a small space on the kitchen hearth placed the dough rolled up in green leaves in the hollow and covering it with hot embers left it to be baked into bread which was done in about half an hour These loaves constituted the only supper of the slaves belonging to this family for I observed that the two women who had waited at the table after the supper of the white people was disposed of also came with their corn to the mill on the post and ground their allowance like the others They had not been permitted to taste even the fragments of the meal that they had cooked for their masters and mistresses It was eleven o'clock before these people had finished their supper of cakes and several of them especially the younger of the two lads were so overpowered with toil and sleep that they had to be roused from their slumbers when their cakes were done to devour them We had for our supper to-night a pint of boiled rice to each person and a small quantity of stale and very rancid butter from the bottom of an old keg or firkin which contained about two pounds the remnant of that which once filled it We boiled the rice ourselves in a large iron kettle and as our master now informed us that we were to remain here some time many of us determined to avail ourselves of this season of respite from our toils to wash our clothes and free our persons from the vermin which had appeared amongst our party several weeks before and now begun to be extremely tormenting As we were not allowed any soap we were obliged to resort to the use of a very fine and unctuous kind of clay resembling fullers' earth but of a yellow colour which was found on the margin of a small swamp near the house This was the first time that I had ever heard of clay being used for the purpose of washing clothes but I often availed myself of this resource afterwards whilst I was a slave in the south We wet our clothes then rubbed this clay all over the garments and by scouring it out in warm water with our hands the cloth whether of woollen cotton or linen texture was left entirely clean We subjected our persons to the same process and in this way freed our camp from the host of enemies that had been generated in the course of our journey This washing consumed the whole of the first day of our residence on the plantation of Mr Hulig We all lay the first night in a shed or summer kitchen standing behind the house and a few yards from it a place in which the slaves of the plantation washed their clothes and passed their Sundays in warm weather when they did not work but as this place was quite too small to accommodate our party or indeed to contain us without crowding us together in such a manner as to endanger our health we were removed the morning after our arrival to an old decayed frame building about one hundred yards from the house which had been erected as I learned for a cotton-gin but into which its possessor for want of means I presume had never introduced the machinery of the gin This building was near forty feet square was without any other floor than the earth and had neither doors nor windows to close the openings which had been left for the admission of those who entered it We were told that in this place the cotton of the plantation was deposited in the picking season as it was brought from the field until it could be removed to a neighbouring plantation where there was a gin to divest it of its seeds Here we took our temporary abode--men and women promiscuously Our provisions whilst we remained here were regularly distributed to us and the daily allowance to each person consisted of a pint of corn a pint of rice and about three or four pounds of butter such as we had received on the night of our arrival divided amongst us in small pieces from the point of a table knife The rice we boiled in the iron kettle--we ground our corn at the little mill on the post in the kitchen and converted the meal into bread in the manner we had been accustomed to at home--sometimes on the hearth and sometimes before the fire on a hoe The butter was given us as an extraordinary ration to strengthen and recruit us after our long march and give us a healthy and expert appearance at the time of our future sale We had no beds of any kind to sleep on but each one was provided with a blanket which had been the companion of our travels We were left entirely at liberty to go out or in when we pleased and no watch was kept over us either by night or day Our master had removed us so far from our native country that he supposed it impossible for any of us ever to escape from him and surmount all the obstacles that lay between us and our former homes He went away immediately after we were established in our new lodgings and remained absent until the second evening about sundown when he returned came into our shed sat down on a block of wood in the midst of us and asked if any one had been sick if we had got our clothes clean and if we had been supplied with an allowance of rice corn and butter After satisfying himself upon these points he told us that we were now at liberty to run away if we chose to do so but if we made the attempt we should most certainly be re-taken and subjected to the most terrible punishment I never flog he My practice is to cat-haul and if you run away and I catch you again--as I surely shall do--and give you one cat-hauling you will never run away again nor attempt it I did not then understand the import of cat-hauling but in after times became well acquainted with its signification We remained in this place nearly two weeks during which time our allowance of food was not varied and was regularly given to us We were not required to do any work and I had liberty and leisure to walk about the plantation and make such observations as I could upon the new state of things around me Gentlemen and ladies came every day to look at us with a view of becoming our purchasers and we were examined with minute care as to our ages former occupations and capacity of performing labour Our persons were inspected and more especially the hands were scrutinized to see if all the fingers were perfect and capable of the quick motions necessary in picking cotton Our master only visited us once a day and sometimes he remained absent two days so that he seldom met any of those who came to see us but whenever it so happened that he did meet them he laid aside his silence and became very talkative and even animated in his conversation extolling our good qualities and averring that he had purchased some of us of one colonel and others of another general in Virginia that he could by no means have procured us had it not been that in some instances our masters had ruined themselves and were obliged to sell us to save their families from ruin and in others that our owners were dead their estates deeply in debt and we had been sold at public sale by which means he had become possessed of us He our habits were unexceptionable our characters good and that there was not one amongst us all who had ever been known to run away or steal any thing from our former masters I observed that running away and stealing from his master were regarded as the highest crimes of which a slave could be guilty but I heard no questions asked concerning our propensity to steal from other people besides our masters and I afterwards learned that this was not always regarded as a very high crime by the owner of a slave provided he would perpetrate the theft so adroitly as not to be detected in it We were severally asked by our visiters if we would be willing to live with them if they would purchase us to which we generally replied in the affirmative but our owner declined all the offers that were made for us upon the ground that we were too poor--looked too bad to be sold at present--and that in our condition he could not expect to get a fair value for us One evening when our master was with us a thin sallow-looking man rode up to the house and alighting from his horse came to us and told him that he had come to buy a boy that he wished to get a good field hand and would pay a good price for him I never saw a human countenance that expressed more of the evil passions of the heart than did that of this man and his conversation corresponded with his physiognomy Every sentence of his language was accompanied with an oath of the most vulgar profanity and his eyes appeared to me to be the index of a soul as cruel as his visage was disgusting and repulsive After looking at us for some time this wretch singled me out as the object of his choice and coming up to me asked me how I would like him for a master In my heart I detested him but a slave is often afraid to speak the truth and divulge all he feels so with myself in this instance as it was doubtful whether I might not fall into his hands and be subject to the violence of his temper I told him that if he was a good master as every gentleman ought to be I should be willing to live with him He appeared satisfied with my answer and turning to my master he would give a high price for me I can he by going to Charleston buy as many Guinea negroes as I please for two hundred dollars each but as I like this fellow I will give you four hundred for him This offer struck terror into my very heart for I knew it was as much as was generally given for the best and ablest slaves and I expected that it would immediately be accepted as my price and that I should be at once consigned to the hands of this man of whom I had formed so abhorrent an opinion To my surprise and satisfaction however my master made no reply to the proposition but stood for a moment with one hand raised to his face and his fore-finger on his nose and then turning suddenly to me Charles go into the house I shall not sell you to-day It was my business to obey the order of departure and as I went beyond the sound of their voices I could not understand the purport of the conversation which followed between these two traffickers in human blood but after a parley of about a quarter of an hour the hated stranger started abruptly away and going to the road mounted his horse and rode off at a gallop banishing himself and my fears together I did not see my master again this evening and when I came out of our barracks in the morning although it was scarcely daylight I saw him standing near one corner of the building with his head inclined towards the wall evidently listening to catch any sounds within He ordered me to go and feed his horse and have him saddled for him by sunrise About an hour afterwards he came to the stable in his riding dress and told me that he should remove us all to Columbia in a few days He then rode away and did not return until the third day afterwards VII IT was now about the middle of June the weather excessively warm and from eleven o'clock A M until late in the afternoon the sand about our residence was so hot that we could not stand on it with our bare feet in one posture more than one or two minutes The whole country so far as I could see appeared to be a dead plain without the least variety of either hill or dale The pine was so far the predominating timber of the forest that at a little distance the entire woods appeared to be composed of this tree I had become weary of being confined to the immediate vicinity of our lodgings and determined to venture out into the fields of the plantation and see the manner of cultivating cotton Accordingly after I had made my morning meal upon corn cakes I sallied out in the direction which I had seen the slaves of the plantation take at the time they left the house at daylight and following a path through a small field of corn which was so tall as to prevent me from seeing beyond it I soon arrived at the field in which the people were at work with hoes amongst the cotton which was about two feet and a half high and had formed such long branches that they could no longer plough in it without breaking it Expecting to pass the remainder of my life in this kind of labour I felt anxious to know the evils if any attending it and more especially the manner in which the slaves wore treated or the cotton estates The people now before me were all diligently and laboriously weeding and hilling the cotton with hoes and when I approached them they scarcely took time to speak to me but continued their labour as if I had not been present As there did not appear to be any overseer with them I thought I would go amongst them and enter into conversation with them but upon addressing myself to one of the men and telling him if it was not disagreeable to him I should be glad to become acquainted with him he he should be glad to be acquainted with me but master Tom did not allow him to talk much to people when he was at work I asked him where his master Tom was but before he had time to reply some one called--Mind your work there you rascals Looking in the direction of the sound I saw master Tom sitting under the shade of a sassafras tree at the distance of about a hundred yards from us Deeming it unsafe to continue in the field without the permission of its lord I approached the sassafras tree with my hat in my hand and in a very humble manner asked leave to help the people work awhile as I was tired of staying about the house and doing nothing He he did not care I might go and work with th m awhile but I must take care not to talk too much and keep his hands from their work Now having authority on my side I returned and taking a hoe from the hands of a small girl told her to pull up weeds and I would take her row for her When we arrived at the end of the rows which we were then hilling master Tom who still held his post under the sassafras tree called his people to come to breakfast Although I had already broken my fast I went with the rest for the purpose of seeing what their breakfast was composed of At the tree I saw a keg which contained about five gallons with water in it and a gourd lying by it near this was a basket made of splits large enough to hold more than a peck It contained the breakfast of the people covered by some green leaves of the magnolia or great bay tree of the south When the leaves were removed I found that the supply of provisions consisted of one cake of corn meal weighing about half a pound for each person This bread had no sort of seasoning not even salt and constituted the only breakfast of these poor people who had been toiling from early dawn until about eight o'clock There was no cake for me and master Tom did not say any thing to me on the state of my stomach but the young girl whose hoe I had taken in the field offered me a part of her cake which I refused After the breakfast was despatched we again returned to our work but the master ordered the girl whose hoe I had to go and get another hoe which lay at some distance in the field and take her row again I continued in the field until dinner which took place about one o'clock and was the same in all respects as the breakfast had been Master Tom was the younger of the two brothers who returned from the cook-fight on the evening of our arrival at this place--he left the field about ten o'clock and was succeeded by his elder brother as overseer for the remainder of the day After this change of superintendents my companions became more loquacious and in the course of an hour or two I had become familiar with the condition of my fellow-labourers who told me that the elder of their young masters was much less tyrannical than his younger brother and that whilst the former remained in the field they would be at liberty to talk as much as they pleased provided they did not neglect their work One of the men who appeared to be about forty years of age and who was the foreman of the field told me that he had been born in South Carolina and had always lived there though he had only belonged to his present master about ten years I asked him if his master allowed him no meat nor any kind of provisions except bread to which he replied that they never had any meat except at Christmas when each hand on the place received about three pounds of pork that from September when the sweet potatoes were at the maturity of their growth they had an allowance of potatoes as long as the crop held out which was generally until about March but that for the rest of the year they had nothing but a peck of corn a week with such weeds and other vegetables as they could gather from the fields for greens--that their master did not allow them any salt and that the only means they had of procuring this luxury was by work ng on Sundays for the neigbouring planters who paid them in money at the rate of fifty cents per day with which they purchased salt and some other articles of convenience This man told me that his master furnished him with two shirts of tow linen and two pair of trousers one of woollen and the other of linen cloth one woollen jacket and one blanket every year That he received the woollen clothes at Christmas and the linen at Easter and all the other clothes if he had any he was obliged to provide for himself by working on Sunday He that for several years past he had not been able to provide any clothes for himself as he had a wife with several small children on an adjoining plantation whose master gave only one suit of clothes in the year to the mother and none of any kind to the children which had compelled him to lay out all his savings in providing clothes for his family and such little necessaries as were called for by his wife from time to time He had not had a shoe on his foot for several years but in winter made a kind of moccasin for himself of the bark of a tree which he was abundant in the swamps and could be so manufactured as to make good ropes and tolerable moccasins sufficient at least to defend the feet from the frost though not to keep them dry The old man whom I have alluded to before was in the field with the others though he was not able to keep up his row He had no clothes on him except the remains of an old shirt which hung in tatters from his neck and arms the two young girls had nothing on them but petticoats made of coarse tow cloth and the woman who was the mother of the children wore the remains of a tow linen shift the front part of which was entirely gone but a piece of old cotton bagging tied round her loins served the purposes of an apron The younger of the two boys was entirely naked The man who was foreman of the field was a person of good sense for the condition of life in which fortune had placed him and spoke to me freely of his hard lot I observed that under his shirt which was very ragged he wore a piece of fine linen cloth apparently part of an old shirt wrapped closely round his back and confined in front by strings tied down his breast I asked him why be wore that piece of gentleman's linen under his shirt and shall give his reply in his own words as well as I can recollect them at a distance of near thirty years I have always been a hard working man and have suffered a great deal from hunger in my time It is not possible for a man to work hard every day for several months and get nothing but a peck of corn a week to eat and not feel hungry When a man is hungry you know if you have ever been hungry he must eat whatever he can get I have not tasted meat since last Christmas and we have had to work uncommonly hard this summer Master has a flock of sheep that run in the woods and they come every night to sleep in the lane near the house Two weeks ago last Saturday when we quit work at night I was very hungry and as we went to the house we passed along the lane where the sheep lay There were nearly fifty of them and some were very fat The temptation was more than I could bear I caught one of them cut its head off with the hoe that I carried on my shoulder and threw it under the fence About midnight when all was still about the house I went out with a knife took the sheep into the woods and dressed it by the light of the moon The carcass I took home and after cutting it up placed it in the great kettle over a good fire intending to boil it and divide it when cooked between my fellow-slaves whom I knew to be as hungry as I was and myself Unfortunately for me master Tom who had been out amongst his friends that day had not returned at bed-time and about one o'clock in the morning at the time when I had a blazing fire under the kettle I heard the sound of the feet of a horse coming along the lane The kitchen walls were open so that the light of my fire could not be concealed and in a moment I heard the horse blowing at the front of the house Conscious of my danger I stripped my shirt from my back and pushed it into the boiling kettle so as wholly to conceal the flesh of the sheep I had scarcely completed this act of precaution when master Tom burst into the kitchen and with a terrible oath asked me what I was doing so late at night with a great fire in the kitchen I replied 'I am going to wash my shirt master and am boiling it to get it clean' 'Washing your shirt at this time of night' he 'I will let you know that you are not to sit up all night and be lazy and good for nothing all day There shall be no boiling of shirts here on Sunday morning' and thrusting his cane into the kettle he raised my shirt out and threw it on the kitchen floor He did not at first observe the mutton which rose to the surface of the water as soon as the shirt was removed but after giving the shirt a kick towards the door he again turned his face to the fire and seeing a leg standing several inches out of the pot he demanded of me what I had in there and where I had got this meat Finding that I was detected and that the whole matter must be discovered I --'Master I am hungry and am cooking my supper' 'What is it you have in here' 'A sheep' I and as the words were uttered he knocked me down with his cane and after beating me severely ordered me to cross my hands until he bound me fast with a rope that hung in the kitchen and answered the double purpose of a clothes' line and a cord to tie us with when we were to be whipped He put out the fire under the kettle drew me into the yard tied me fast to the mill-post and leaving me there for the night went and called one of the negro boys to put his horse in the stable and went to his bed The cord was bound so tightly round my wrists that before morning the blood had burst out under my finger nails but I suppose my master slept soundly for all that I was afraid to call any one to come and release me from my torment lest a still more terrible punishment might overtake me I was permitted to remain in this situation until long after sunrise the next morning which being Sunday was quiet and still my fellow-slaves being permitted to take their rest after the severe toil of the past week and my old master and two young ones having no occasion to rise to call the hands to the field did not think of interrupting their morning slumbers to release me from my painful confinement However when the sun was risen about an hour I heard the noise of persons moving in the great house and soon after a loud and boisterous conversation which I well knew portended no good to me At length they all three came into the yard where I lay lashed to the post and approaching me my old master asked me if I had any accomplices in stealing the sheep I told them none--that it was entirely my own act--and that none of my fellow-slaves had any hand in it This was the truth but if any of my companions had been concerned with me I should not have betrayed them for such an act of treachery could not have alleviated the dreadful punishment which I knew awaited me and would only have involved them in the same misery They called me a thief loaded me with oaths and imprecations and each one proposed the punishment which he deemed the most appropriate to the enormity of the crime that I had committed Master Tom was of opinion that I should be lashed to the post at the foot of which I lay and that each of my fellow slaves should be compelled to give me a dozen lashes in turn with a roasted and greased hickory gad until I had received in the whole two hundred and fifty lashes on my bare back and that he would stand by with the whip in his hand and compel them not to spare me but after a short debate this was given up as it would probably render me unable to work in the field again for several weeks My master Ned was in favour of giving me a dozen lashes every morning for a month with the whip but my old master this would be attended with too much trouble and besides it would keep me from my work at least half an hour every morning and proposed in his turn that I should not be whipped at all but that the carcass of the sheep should be taken from the kettle in its half-boiled condition and hung up in the kitchen loft without salt and that I should be compelled to subsist on this putrid mutton without any other food until it should be consumed This suggestion met the approbation of my young masters and would have been adopted had not mistress at this moment come into the yard and hearing the intended punishment loudly objected to it because the mutton would in a day or two create such an offensive stench that she and my young mistresses would not be able to remain in the house My mistress swore dreadfully and cursed me for an ungrateful sheep thief who after all her kindness in giving me soup and warm bread when I was sick last winter was always stealing every thing I could get hold of She then to my master that such villany ought not to be passed over in a slight manner and that as crimes such as this concerned the whole country my punishment ought to be public for the purpose of example and advised him to have me whipped that same afternoon at five o'clock first giving notice to the planters of the neighbourhood to come and see the spectacle and to bring with them their slaves that they might be witnesses to the consequences of stealing sheep They then returned to the house to breakfast but as the pain in my hands and arms produced by the ligatures of the cord with which I was bound was greater than I could bear I now felt exceedingly sick and lost all knowledge of my situation They told me I fainted and when I recovered my faculties I found myself lying in the shade of the house with my hands free and all the white persons in my master's family standing around me As soon as I was able to stand the rope was tied round my neck and the other end again fastened to the mill post My mistress I had only pretended to faint and master Tom I would have something worth fainting for before night He was faithful to his promise but for the present I was suffered to sit on the grass in the shade of the house As soon as breakfast was over my two young masters had their horses saddled and set out to give notice to their friends of what had happened and to invite them to come and see me punished for the crime I had committed My mistress gave me no breakfast and when I begged one of the black boys whom I saw looking at me through the pales to bring me some water in a gourd to drink she ordered him to bring it from a puddle in the lane My mistress had always been very cruel to all her black people I remained in this situation until about eleven o'clock when one of my young mistresses came to me and gave me a piece of jonny-cake about the size of my hand perhaps larger than my hand telling me at the same time that my fellow-slaves had been permitted to re-boil the mutton that I had left in the kettle and make their breakfast of it but that her mother would not allow her to give me any part of it It was well for them that I had parboiled it with my shirt and so defiled it that it was unfit for the table of my master otherwise no portion of it would have fallen to the black people--as it was they had as much meat as they could consume in two days for which I had to suffer About twelve o'clock one of my young masters returned and soon afterwards the other came home I heard them tell my old master that they had been round to give notice of my offence to the neighbouring planters and that several of them would attend to see me flogged and would bring with them some of their slaves who m be able to report to their companions what had been done to me for stealing It was late in the afternoon before any of the gentlemen came but before five o'clock there were more than twenty white people and at least fifty black ones present the latter of whom had been compelled by their masters to come and see me punished Amongst others an overseer from a neighbouring estate attended and to him was awarded the office of executioner I was stripped of my shirt and the waist-band of my trousers was drawn closely round me below my hips so as to expose the whole of my back in its entire length It seems that it had been determined to beat me with thongs of raw cow-hide for the overseer had two of these in his hands each about four feet long but one of the gentlemen present this might bruise my back so badly that I could not work for some time perhaps not for a week or two and as I could not be spared from the field without great disadvantage to my master's crop he suggested a different plan by which in his opinion the greatest degree of pain could be inflicted on me with the least danger of rendering me unable to work As he was a large planter and had more than fifty slaves all were disposed to be guided by his counsels and my master he would submit the matter entirely to him as a man of judgment and experience in such cases He then desired my master to have a dozen pods of red pepper boiled in half a gallon of water and desired the overseer to lay aside his thongs of raw hide and put a new cracker of silk to the lash of his negro whip Whilst these preparations were being made each of my thumbs was lashed closely to the end of a stick about three feet long and a chair being placed beside the mill post I was compelled to raise my hands and place the stick to which my thumbs were bound over the top of the post which is about eighteen inches square the chair was then taken from under me and I was left hanging by the thumbs with my face towards the post and my feet about a foot from the ground My two great toes were then tied together and drawn down the post as far as my joints could be stretched the cord was passed round the post two or three times and securely fastened In this posture I had no power of motion except in my neck and could only move that at the expense of beating my face against the side of the post The pepper tea was now brought and poured into a basin to cool and the overseer was desired to give me a dozen lashes just above the waist-band and not to cover a space of more than four inches on my back from the waist-band upwards He obeyed the injunction faithfully but slowly and each crack of the whip was followed by a sensation as painful as if a red hot iron had been drawn across my back When the twelve strokes had been given the operation was suspended and a black man one of the slaves present was compelled to wash the gashes in my skin with the scalding pepper tea which was yet so hot that he could not hold his hand in it This doubly-burning liquid was thrown into my raw and bleeding wounds and produced a tormenting smart beyond the description of language After a delay of ten minutes by the watch I received another dozen lashes on the part of my back which was immediately above the bleeding and burning gashes of the former whipping and again the biting stinging pepper tea was applied to my lacerated and trembling muscles This operation was continued at regular intervals until I had received ninety-six lashes and my back was cut and scalded from end to end Every stroke of the whip had drawn blood many of the gashes were three inches long my back burned as if it had been covered by a coat of hot embers mixed with living coals and I felt my flesh quiver like that of animals that I slaughtered by the butcher and are flayed whilst yet half alive My face was bruised and my nose bled profusely for in the madness of my agony I had not been able to refrain from beating my head violently against the post Vainly did I beg and implore for mercy I was kept bound to the post with my whole weight hanging upon my thumbs an hour and a half but it appeared to me that I had entered upon eternity and that my sufferings would never end At length however my feet were unbound and afterwards my hands but when released from the cords I was so far exhausted as not to be able to stand and my thumbs were stiff and motionless I was carried into the kitchen and laid on a blanket where my ss came to see me and after looking at my lacerated back and telling me that my wounds were only skin deep I had come off well after what I had done and that I ought to be thankful that it was not worse with me She then bade me not to groan so loud nor make so much noise and left me to myself I lay in this condition until it was quite dark by which time the burning of my back had much abated and was succeeded by an aching soreness which rendered me unable to turn over or bend my spine in the slightest manner My mistress again visited me and brought with her about half a pound of fat bacon which she made one of the black women roast before the fire on a fork until the oil ran freely from it and then rub it warm over my back This was repeated until I was greased from the neck to the hips effectually An old blanket was then thrown over me and I was left to pass the night alone Such was the terror stricken into my fellow-slaves by the example made of me that although they loved and pitied me not one of them dared to approach me during this night My strength was gone and I at length fell asleep from which I did not awake until the horn was blown the next morning to call the people to the corn crib to receive their weekly allowance of a peck of corn I did not rise nor attempt to join the other people and shortly afterwards my master entered the kitchen and in a soft and gentle tone of voice asked me if I was dead I answered him that I was not dead and making some effort found I was able to get upon my feet My master had become frightened when he missed me at the corn crib and being suddenly seized with an apprehension that I was dead his heart had become softened not with compassion for my sufferings but with the fear of losing his best field hand but when he saw me stand before him erect and upright the recollection of the lost sheep revived in his mind and with it all his feelings of revenge against the author of its death 'So you are not dead yet you thieving rascal' he and cursing me with many bitter oaths ordered me to go along to the crib and get my corn and go to work with the rest of the hands I was forced to obey and taking my basket of corn from the door of the crib placed it in the kitchen loft and went to the field with the other people Weak and exhausted as I was I was compelled to do the work of an able hand but was not permitted to taste the mutton which was all given to the others who were carefully guarded whilst they were eating lest they should give me some of it This man's back was not yet well Many of the gashes made by the lash were yet sore and those that were healed had left long white stripes across his body He had no notion of leaving the service of his tyrannical master and his spirit was so broken and subdued that he was ready to suffer and to bear all his hardships not indeed without complaining but without attempting to resist his oppressors or to escape from their power I saw him often whilst I remained at this place and ventured to tell him once that if I had a master who would abuse me as his had abused him I would run away Where could I run or in what place could I conceal myself he I have known many slaves who ran away but they were always caught and treated worse afterwards than they had been before I have heard that there is a place called Philadelphia where the black people are all free but I do not know which way it lies nor what road I should take to go there and if I knew the way how could I hope to get there would not the patrol be sure to catch me I pitied this unfortunate creature and was at the same time fearful that in a short time I should be equally the object of pity myself How well my fears were justified the sequel of my narrative will show VIII We had been stationed in the old cotton-gin house about twenty days had recovered from the fatigues of our journey and were greatly improved our strength and appearance when our master returned one evening after an absence of two days and told us that we must go to Columbia the next day and must for this purpose have our breakfast ready by sunrise On the following morning he called us at daylight and we made all despatch in preparing our morning repast the last that we were to take in our present residence As our equipments consisted of the few clothes we had on our persons and a solitary blanket to each individual our baggage was easily adjusted and we were on the road before the sun was up half an hour and in less than an hour we were in Columbia drawn up in a long line in the street opposite the court-house The town which was small and mean looking was full of people and I believe that more than a thousand gentlemen came to look at us within the course of this day We were kept in the street about an hour and were then taken into the jail-yard and permitted to sit down but were not shut up in the jail The court was sitting in Columbia at this time and either this circumstance or the intelligence of our arrival in the country or both had drawn together a very great crowd of people We were supplied with victuals by the jailer and had a small allowance of salt pork for dinner We slept in the jail at night and as none of us had been sold on the day of our arrival in Columbia and we had not heard any of the persons who came to look at us make proposals to our master for our purchase I supposed it might be his intention to drive us still farther south before he offered us for sale but I discovered my error on the second day which was Tuesday This day the crowd in town was much greater than it had been on Monday and about ten o'clock our master came into the yard in company with the jailer and after looking at us some time the latter addressed us in a short speech which continued perhaps five minutes In this harangue he told us we had come to live in the finest country in the world that South Carolina was the richest and best part of the United States and that he was going to sell us to gentlemen who would make us all very happy and would require us to do no hard work but only raise cotton and pick it He then ordered a handsome young lad about eighteen years of age to follow him into the street where we observed a great concourse of persons collected Here the jailer made another harangue to the multitude in which he assured them that he was just about to sell the most valuable lot of slaves that had ever been offered in Columbia That we were all young in excellent health of good habits having been all purchased in Virginia from the estates of tobacco planters and that there was not one in the whole lot who had lost the use of a single finger or was blind of an eye He then cried the poor lad for sale and the first bid he received was two hundred dollars Others quickly succeeded and the boy who was a remarkably handsome youth was striken off in a few minutes to a young man who appeared not much older than himself at three hundred and fifty dollars The purchaser paid down his price to our master on a table in the jail and the lad after bidding us farewell followed his new master with tears running down his cheeks He next sold a young girl about fifteen or sixteen years old for two hundred and fifty dollars to a lady who attended the sales in her carriage and made her bids out of the window In this manner the sales were continued for about two hours and a half when they were adjourned until three o'clock In the afternoon they were again resumed and kept open until about five o'clock when they were closed for the day As my companions were sold they were taken from amongst us and we saw them no more The next morning before day I was awakened from my sleep by the sound of several heavy fires of cannon which were discharged as it seemed to me within a few yards of the place where I lay These were succeeded by fifes and drums and all the noise with which I had formerly heard the fourth of July ushered in at the navy-yard in Washington Since I had left Maryland I had carefully kept the reckoning of the days of the week but had not been careful to note the dates of the month yet as soon as daylight appeared and the door of our apartment was opened I inquired and learned that this was as I had supposed it to be the day of universal rejoicing I understood that the court did not sit this day but a great crowd of people gathered and remained around the jail all the morning many of whom were intoxicated and sang and shouted in honour of free government and the rights of man About eleven o'clock a long table was spread under a row of trees which grew in the street not far from the jail and which appeared to me to be of the kind called in Pennsylvania the pride of China At this table several hundred persons sat down to dinner soon after noon and continued to eat and drink and sing songs in honour of liberty for more than two hours At the end of the dinner a gentleman rose and stood upon his chair near one end of the table and begged the company to hear him for a few minutes He informed them that he was a candidate for some office--but what office it was I do not recollect--and that as it was an acknowledged principle of our free government that all men were born free and equal he presumed it would not be deemed an act of arrogance in him to call upon them for their votes at the coming election This first speaker was succeeded by another who addressed his audience in nearly the same language and after he had concluded the company broke up I heard a black man that belonged to the jailer or who was at least in his service say that there had been a great meeting that morning in the court house at which several gentlemen had made speeches When I lived at the navy-yard the officers sometimes permitted me to go up town with them on the fourth of July and listen to the fine speeches that were made there on such occasions About five o'clock the jailer came and stood at the front door of the jail and proclaimed in a very loud voice that a sale of most valuable slaves would immediately take place that he had sold many fine hands yesterday but they were only the refuse and most worthless part of the whole lot--that those who wished to get great bargains and prime property had better attend now as it was certain that such negroes had never been offered for sale in Columbia before In a few minutes the whole assembly that had composed the dinner party and hundreds of others were convened around the jail door and the jailer again proceeded with his auction Several of the stoutest men and handsomest women in the whole company had been reserved for this day and I perceived that the very best of us were kept back for the last We went off at rather better prices than had been obtained on the former day and I perceived much eagerness amongst the bidders many of whom were not sober Within less than three hours only three of us remained in the jail and we were ordered to come and stand at the door in front of the crier who made a most extravagant eulogium upon our good qualities and capacity to perform labour He These three fellows are as strong as horses and as patient as mules one of them can do as much work as two common men and they are perfectly honest Mr M'Giffin says he was assured by their former masters that they were never known to steal or run away They must bring good prices gentlemen or they will not be sold Their master is determined that if they do not bring six hundred dollars he will not sell them but will take them to Georgia next summer and sell them to some of the new settlers These boys can do any thing This one referring to me can cut five cords of wood in a day and put it up He is a rough carpenter and a first rate field hand This one laying his hand on the shoulder of one of my companions is a blacksmith and can lay a ploughshare put new steel upon an axe or mend a broken chain The other he recommended as a good shoemaker and well acquainted with the process of tanning leather We were all nearly of the same age and very stout healthy robust young men in full possession of our corporal powers and if we had been shut up in a room with ten of the strongest of those who had assembled to purchase us and our liberty had depended on tying them fast to each other I have no doubt that we should have been free if ropes had been provided for us After a few minutes of hesitancy amongst the purchasers and a closer examination of our persons than had been made in the jail-yard an elderly gentleman he would take the carpenter and the blacksmith and shoemaker were immediately taken by others at the required price It was now sundown The heat of the day had been very oppressive and I was glad to be released from the confined air of the jail and the hot atmosphere in which so many hundreds were breathing My new master asked me my name and ordered me to follow him We proceeded to a tavern where a great number of persons were assembled at a short distance from the jail My master entered the house and joined in the conversation of the party in which the utmost hilarity prevailed They were drinking toasts in honour of liberty and independence over glasses of toddy a liquor composed of a mixture of rum water sugar and nutmeg It was ten o'clock at night before my master and his companions had finished their toasts and toddy and all this time I had been standing before the door or sitting on a log of wood that lay in front of the house At one time I took a seat on a bench at the side of the house but was soon driven from this position by a gentleman in military clothes with a large gilt epaulet on each shoulder and a profusion of glittering buttons on his coat who passing near me in the dark and happening to cast his eye on me demanded of me in an imperious tone how I dared to sit on that seat I told him I was a stranger and did not know that it was wrong to sit there He then ordered me with an oath to begone from there and if he caught me on that bench again he would cut my head off Did you not see white people sit upon that bench you saucy rascal he I assured him I had not seen any white gentleman sit on the bench as it was near night when I came to the house that I had not intended to be saucy or misbehave myself and that I hoped he would not be angry with me as my master had left me at the door and had not told me where I was to sit I remained on the log until the termination of the festival in honour of liberty and equality when my master came to the door and observed in my hearing to some of his friends that they had celebrated the day in a handsome manner No person except the military gentleman had spoken to me since I came to the house in the evening with my master who seemed to have forgotten me for he remained at the door warmly engaged in conversation on various political subjects a full hour after he rose from the toast party At length however I heard him say--I bought a negro this evening--I wonder where he is Rising immediately from the log on which I had been so long seated I presented myself before him and Here master He then ordered me to go to the kitchen of the inn and go to sleep but nothing to me about supper I retired to the kitchen where I found a large number of servants who belonged to the house and amongst them two young girls who had been purchased by a gentleman who lived near Augusta and who they told me intended to set out for his plantation the next morning and take them with him These girls had been sold out of our company on the first day and had been living in the tavern kitchen since that time They appeared quite contented and evinced no repugnance to setting out the next morning for their master's plantation They were of that order of people who never look beyond the present day and so long as they had plenty of victuals in this kitchen they did not trouble themselves with reflections upon the cotton field One of the servants gave me some cold meat and a piece of wheaten bread which was the first I had tasted since I left Maryland and indeed it was the last that I tasted until I reached Maryland again I here met with a man who was born and brought up in the Northern Neck of Virginia on the banks of the Potomac and within a few miles of my native place We soon formed an acquaintance and sat up nearly all night He was the chief hostler in the stable of this tavern and told me that he had often thought of attempting to escape and return to Virginia He he had little doubt of being able to reach the Potomac but having no knowledge of the country beyond that river he was afraid that he should not be able to make his way to Philadelphia which he regarded as the only place in which he could be safe from the pursuit of his master I was myself then young and my knowledge of the country north of Baltimore was very vague and undefined I however told him that I had heard that if a black man could reach any part of Pennsylvania he would be beyond the reach of his pursuers He he could not justly complain of want of food but the services required of him were so unreasonable and the punishment frequently inflicted upon him so severe that he was determined to set out for the north as soon as the corn was so far ripe as to be fit to be roasted He felt confident that by lying in the woods and unfrequented places all day and travelling only by night he could escape the vigilance of all pursuit and gain the Northern Neck before the corn would be gathered from the fields He had no fear of wanting food as be could live well on roasting ears as long as the corn was in the milk and afterwards on parched corn as long as the grain remained in the field I advised him as well as I could as to the best means of reaching the state of Pennsylvania but was not able to give him any very definite instructions This man possessed a very sound understanding and having been five years in Carolina was well acquainted with the country He gave me such an account of the sufferings of the slaves on the cotton and indigo plantations--of whom I now regarded myself as one--that I was unable to sleep any this night From the resolute manner in which he spoke of his intended elopement and the regularity with which he had connected the various combinations of the enterprise I have no doubt that he undertook that which he intended to perform Whether he was successful or not in the enterprise I cannot say as I never saw him nor heard of him after the next morning This man certainly communicated to me the outlines of the plan which I afterwards put in execution and by which I gained my liberty at the expense of sufferings which none can appreciate except those who have borne all that the stoutest human constitution can bear of cold and hunger toil and pain The conversation of this slave aroused in my breast so many recollections of the past and fears of the future that I did not lie down but sat on an old chair until daylight From the people of the kitchen I again received some cold victuals for my breakfast but I did not see my master until about nine o'clock the toddy of the last evening causing him to sleep late this morning At length a female slave gave me notice that my master wished to see me in the dining room whither I repaired without a moment's delay When I entered the room he was sitting near the window smoking a pipe with a very long handle--I believe more than two feet in length He asked no questions but addressing me by the title of boy ordered me to go with the hostler of the inn and get his horse and chaise ready As soon as this order could be executed I informed him that his chaise was at the door and we immediately commenced our journey to the plantation of my master which he told me lay at the distance of twenty miles from Columbia He I must keep up with him and as he drove at the rate of five or six miles an hour I was obliged to run nearly half the time but I was then young and could easily travel fifty or sixty miles in a day It was with great anxiety that I looked for the place which was in future to be my home but this did not prevent me from making such observations upon the state of the country through which we travelled as the rapidity of our march permitted This whole region had originally been one vast wilderness of pine forest except the low grounds and river bottoms here called swamps in which all the varieties of trees shrubs vines and plants peculiar to such places in southern latitudes vegetated in unrestrained luxuriance Nor is pine the only timber that grows on the uplands in this part of Carolina although it is the predominant tree and in some places prevails to the exclusion of every other--oak hickory sassafras and many others are found Here also I first observed groves of the most beautiful of all the trees of the wood--the great Southern Magnolia or Green Bay No adequate conception can be formed of the appearance or the fragrance of this most magnificent tree by any one who has not seen it or scented the air when tainted by the perfume of its flowers It rises in a right line to the height of seventy or eighty feet the stem is of a delicate taper form and casts off numerous branches in nearly right angles with itself the extremities of which decline gently towards the ground and become shorter and shorter in the ascent until at the apex of the tree they are scarcely a foot in length whilst below they are many times found twenty feet long The immense cones formed by these trees are as perfect as those diminutive forms which nature exhibits in the bur of the pine tree The leaf of the magnolia is smooth of an oblong taper form about six inches in length and half as broad Its colour is the deepest and purest green The foliage of the Bay tree is as impervious as a brick wall to the rays of the sun and its coolness in the heat of a summer day affords one of the greatest luxuries of a cotton plantation It blooms in May and bears great numbers of broad expanded white flowers the odour of which is exceedingly grateful and so abundant that I have no doubt that a grove of these trees in full bloom may be smelled at a distance of fifteen or twenty miles I have heard it asserted in the south that their scent has been perceived by persons fifty or sixty miles from them This tree is one of nature's most splendid and in the climate where she has placed it one of her most agreeable productions It is peculiar to the southern temperate latitudes and cannot bear the rigours of a northern winter though I have heard that groves of the Bay are found on Fishing Creek in Western Virginia not far from Wheeling and near the Ohio river Could this tree be naturalized in Pennsylvania it would form an ornament to her towns cities and country seats at once the most tasteful and the most delicious A forest of these trees in the month of May resembles a wood enveloped in an untimely fall of snow at midsummer glowing in the rays of a morning sun We passed this day through cotton fields and pine woods alternately but the scene was sometimes enlivened by the appearance of lots of corn and sweet potatoes which I observed were generally planted near the houses I afterwards learned that this custom of planting the corn and potatoes near the house of the planter is general over all Carolina The object is to prevent the slaves from stealing and thus procuring more food than by the laws of the plantation they are entitled to In passing through a lane I this day saw a field which appeared to me to contain about fifty acres in which people were at work with hoes amongst a sort of plants that I had never seen before I asked my master what this was and he told me it was indigo I shall have occasion to say more of this plant hereafter We at length arrived at the residence of my master who descended from his chaise and leaving me in charge of the horse at the gate proceeded to the house across a long court yard In a few minutes two young ladies and a young gentleman came out of the house and walked to the gate near which I was with the horse One of the ladies they had come to look at me and see what kind of a boy her pa had brought home with him The other one I was a very smart looking boy and this compliment flattered me greatly they being the first kind words that had been addressed to me since I left Maryland The young gentleman asked me if I could run fast and if I had ever picked cotton His manner did not impress me so much in his favour as the address of his sister had done for her These three young persons were the son and daughters of my master After looking at me a short time my young master for so I must now call him ordered me to take the harness from the horse give him water at a well which was near and come into the kitchen where some boiled rice was given me for my dinner I was not required to go to work this first day of my abode in my new residence but after I had eaten my rice my young master told me I might rest myself or walk out and see the plantation but that I must be ready to go with the overseer the next morning IX By the laws of the United States I am still a slave and though I am now growing old I might even yet be deemed of sufficient value to be worth pursuing as far as my present residence if those to whom the law gives the right of dominion over my person and life knew where to find me For these reasons I have been advised by those whom I believe to be my friends not to disclose the true names of any of those families in which I was a slave in Carolina or Georgia lest this narrative should meet their eyes and in some way lead them to a discovery of my retreat I was now the slave of one of the most wealthy planters in Carolina who planted cotton rice indigo corn and potatoes and was the master of two hundred and sixty slaves The description of one great cotton plantation will give a correct idea of all others and I shall here present an outline of that of my master He lived about two miles from Caugaree river which bordered his estate on one side and in the swamps of which were his rice fields The country hereabout is very flat the banks of the river are low and in wet seasons large tracts of country are flooded by the superabundant water of the river There are no springs and the only means of procuring water on the plantations is from wells which must be sunk in general about twenty feet deep before a constant supply of water can be obtained My master had two of these wells on his plantation one at the mansion house and one at the quarter My master's house was of brick brick houses are by no means common amongst the planters whose residences are generally built of frame work weather boarded with pine boards and covered with shingles of the white cedar or juniper cypress and contained two large parlours and a spacious hall or entry on the ground floor The main building was two stories high and attached to this was a smaller building one story and a half high with a large room where the family generally took breakfast with a kitchen at the farther extremity from the main building There was a spacious garden behind the house containing I believe about five acres well cultivated and handsomely laid out In this garden grew a great variety of vegetables some of which I have never seen in the market of Philadelphia It contained a profusion of flowers three different shrubberies a vast number of ornamental and small fruit trees and several small hot houses with glass roofs There was a head gardener who did nothing but attend to this garden through the year and during the summer he generally had two men and two boys to assist him In the months of April and May this garden was one of the sweetest and most pleasant places that I ever was in At one end of the main building was a small house called the library in which my master kept his books and papers and where he spent much of his time At some distance from the mansion was a pigeon house and near the kitchen was a large wooden building called the kitchen quarter in which the house servants slept and where they generally took their meals Here also the washing of the family was done and all the rough or unpleasant work of the kitchen department--such as cleaning and salting fish putting up pork c was assigned to this place There was no barn on this plantation according to the acceptation of the word barn in Pennsylvania but there was a wooden building about forty feet long called the coach-house in one end of which the family carriage and the chaise in which my master rode were kept Under the same roof was a stable sufficiently capacious to contain ten or twelve horses In one end of the building the corn intended for the horses was kept and the whole of the loft or upper story was occupied by the fodder or blades and tops of the corn About a quarter of a mile from the dwelling-house were the huts or cabins of the plantation slaves or field hands standing in rows much like the Indian villages which I have seen in the country of the Cherokees These cabins were thirty-eight in number generally about fifteen or sixteen feet square built of hewn logs covered with shingles and provided with floors of pine boards These houses were all dry and comfortable and were provided with chimnies so that the people when in them were well sheltered from the inclemencies of the weather In this practice of keeping their slaves well sheltered at night the southern planters are pretty uniform for they know that upon this circumstance more than any other in that climate depends the health of the slave and consequently his value In these thirty-eight cabins were lodged two hundred and fifty people of all ages sexes and sizes Ten or twelve were generally employed in the garden and about the house At a distance of about one hundred yards from the lines of cabins stood the house of the overseer a small two-story log building with a yard and garden attached to it of proportionate dimensions This small house was the abode of a despot more absolute and more cruel than were any of those we read of in the Bible who so grievously oppressed the children of Israel In one corner of the overseer's garden stood the corn crib also a log building in which was stored up the corn constituting the yearly provisions of the coloured people In another corner of the same garden was a large vault covered with sods very like some ice-houses that I have seen This was the potato-house and in it were deposited the sweet potatoes also intended to supply the people At a short distance beyond the garden of the overseer stood a large building constituting the principal feature in the landscape of every great cotton plantation This was the house containing the cotton-gin and the sheds to contain the cotton when brought from the field in the seed and also the bales after being pressed and prepared for market As I shall be obliged to make frequent references to the cotton-gin it may perhaps be well to describe it Formerly there was no way of separating the cotton from the seed but by pulling it of with the fingers--a very tedious and troublesome process-- but a person from the north by the name of Whitney at length discovered the gin which is a very simple though very powerful machine It is composed of a wooden cylinder about six or eight feet in length surrounded at very short intervals with small circular saws in such a manner that as the cylinder is turned rapidly round by a leather strap on the end similar to a turner's lathe the teeth of the saws in turning over continually cut downwards in front of the cylinder which is placed close to a long hopper extending the whole length of the cylinder and so close to it that the seeds of the cotton cannot pass between them This cylinder revolves with almost inconceivable rapidity and great caution is necessary in working with the gin not to touch the saws One end of the cylinder and hopper being slightly elevated the seeds as they are stripped of the wool are gradually but certainly moved toward the lower end where they drop down into a heap after being as perfectly divested of the cotton as they could be by the most careful picking with the fingers The rapid evolutions of the cylinder are procured by the aid of cogs and wheels similar to those used in small grist mills It is necessary to be very careful in working about a cotton-gin more especially in removing the seeds from before the saws for if they do but touch the hand the injury is very great I knew a black man who had all the sinews of the inner part of his right hand torn out--some of them measuring more than a foot in length--and the flesh of his palm cut into tatters by carelessly putting his hand too near the saws when they were in motion for the idle purpose of feeling the strength of the current of air created by the motions of the cylinder A good gin will clean several thousand pounds of cotton in the seed in a day To work the gin two horses are necessary though one is often compelled to perform the labour There was no smoke-house nor any other place for curing or preserving meat attached to the quarter and whilst I was on this plantation no pork was ever salted for the use of the slaves After remaining in the kitchen some time I went into the garden and remained with the gardener assisting him to work until after sundown when my old master came to the gate and called one of the garden boys to him The boy soon returned and told me I must go with him to the quarter as his master had told him to take me to the overseer When we arrived at the overseer's house he had not yet returned from the field but in a few minutes we saw him coming at some distance through a cotton field followed by a great number of black people As he approached us the boy that was with me handed him a small piece of paper which he carried in his hand and without saying a word ran back toward the house leaving me to become acquainted with the overseer in the best way I could But I found this to be no difficult task for he had no sooner glanced his eye over the piece of paper than turning to me he asked me my name and calling to a middle-aged man who was passing us at some distance told him he must take me to live with him and that my supper should be sent to me from his own house I followed my new friend to his cabin which I found to be the habitation of himself his wife and five children The only furniture in this cabin consisted of a few blocks of wood for seats a short bench made of a pine board which served as a table and a small bed in one corner composed of a mat made of common rushes spread upon some corn husks pulled and split into fine pieces and kept together by a narrow slip of wood confined to the floor by wooden pins There was a common iron pot standing beside the chimney and several wooden spoons and dishes hung against the wall Several blankets also hung against the wall upon wooden pins An old box made of pine boards without either lock or binges occupied one corner At the time I entered this humble abode the mistress was not at home She had not yet returned from the field having been sent as the husband informed me with some other people late in the evening to do some work in a field about two miles distant I found a child about a year old lying on the mat-bed and a little girl about four years old beside it These children were entirely naked and when we came to the door the elder rose front its place and ran to its father and clasping him round one of his knees Now we shall get good supper The father laid his hand upon the head of his naked child and stood silently looking in its face--which was turned upwards toward his own for a moment-- and then turning to me Did you leave any children at home The scene before me--the question propounded--and the manner of this poor man and his child caused my heart to swell until my breast seemed too small to contain it My soul fled back upon the wings of fancy to my wife's lowly dwelling in Maryland where I had been so often met on a Saturday evening when I paid them my weekly visit by my own little ones who clung to my knees for protection and support even as the poor little wretch now before me seized upon the weary limb of its hapless and destitute father hoping that naked as he was for he too was naked save only the tattered remains of a pair of old trousers he would bring with his return at evening its customary scanty supper I was unable to reply but stood motionless leaning against the walls of the cabin My children seemed to flit by the door in the dusky twilight and the twittering of a swallow which that moment fluttered over my head sounded in my ear as the infantile tittering of my own little boy but on a moment's reflection I knew that we were separated without the hope of ever again meeting that they no more heard the welcome tread of my feet and could never again receive the little gifts with which poor as I was I was accustomed to present them I was far from the place of my nativity in a land of strangers with no one to care for me beyond the care that a master bestows upon his ox with all my future life one long waste barren desert of cheerless hopeless lifeless slavery to be varied only by the pangs of hunger and the stings of the lash My revery was at length broken by the appearance of the mother of the family with her three eldest children The mother wore an old ragged shift but the children the eldest of whom appeared to be about twelve and the youngest six years old were quite naked When she came in the husband told her that the overseer had sent me to live with them and she and her oldest child who was a boy immediately set about preparing their supper by boiling some of the leaves of the weed called lamb's-quarter in the pot This together with some cakes of cold corn bread formed their supper My supper was brought to me from the house of the overseer by a small girl his daughter It was about half a pound of bread cut from a loaf made of corn meal My companions gave me a part of their boiled greens and we all sat down together to my first meal in my new habitation I had no other bed than the blanket which I had brought with me from Maryland and I went to sleep in the loft of the cabin which was assigned to me as my sleeping room and in which I continued to lodge as long as I remained on this plantation The next morning I was waked at the break of day by the sound of a horn which was blown very loudly Perceiving that it was growing light I came down and went out immediately in front of the house of the overseer who was standing near his own gate blowing the horn In a few minutes the whole of the working people from all the cabins were assembled and as it was now light enough for me distinctly to see such objects as were about me I at once perceived the nature of the servitude to which I was in future to be subject As I have before stated there were altogether on this plantation two hundred and sixty slaves but the number was seldom stationary for a single week Births were numerous and frequent and deaths were not uncommon When I joined them I believe we counted in all two hundred and sixty-three but of these only one hundred and seventy went to the field to work The others were children too small to be of any service as labourers old and blind persons or incurably diseased Ten or twelve were kept about the mansion-house and garden chosen from the most handsome and sprightly of the gang I think about one hundred and sixty-eight assembled this morning at the sound of the horn--two or three being sick sent word to the overseer that they could not come The overseer wrote something on a piece of paper and gave it to his little son This I was told was a note to be sent to our master to inform him that some of the hands were sick--it not being any part of the duty of the overseer to attend to a sick negro The overseer then led off to the field with his horn in one hand and his whip in the other we following--men women and children promiscuously-- and a wretched looking troop we were There was not an entire garment amongst us More than half of the gang were entirely naked Several young girls who had arrived at puberty wearing only the livery with which nature had ornamented them and a great number of lads of an equal or superior age appeared in the same costume There was neither bonnet cap nor head dress of any king amongst us except the old straw hat that I wore and which my wife had made for me in Maryland This I soon laid aside to avoid the appearance of singularity and as owing to the severe treatment I had endured whilst travelling in chains and being compelled to sleep on the naked floor without undressing myself my clothes were quite worn out I did not make a much better figure than my companions though still I preserved the semblance of clothing so far that it could be seen that my shirt and trousers had once been distinct and separate garments Not one of the others had on even the remains of two pieces of apparel Some of the men had old shirts and some ragged trousers but no one wore both Amongst the women several wore petticoats and many had shifts Not one of the whole number wore both of these vestments We walked nearly a mile through one vast cotton field before we arrived at the place of our intended day's labour At last the overseer stopped at the side of the field and calling to several of the men by name ordered them to call their companies and turn into their rows The work we had to do today was to hoe and weed cotton for the last time and the men whose names had been called and who were I believe eleven in number were designated as captains each of whom had under his command a certain number of the other bands The captain was the foreman of his company and those under his command had to keep up with him Each of the men and women had to take one row and two and in some cases where they were very small three of the children had one The first captain whose name was Simon took the first row-- and the other captains were compelled to keep up with him By this means the overseer had nothing to do but to keep Simon hard at work and he was certain that all the others must work equally hard Simon was a stout strong man apparently about thirty-five years of age and for some reason unknown to me I was ordered to take the row next to his The overseer with his whip in his hand walked about the field after us to see that our work was well done As we worked with hoes I had no difficulty in learning how the work was to be performed The fields of cotton at this season of the year are very beautiful The plants amongst which we worked this day were about three feet high and in full bloom with branches so numerous that they nearly covered the whole ground--leaving scarcely space enough between them to permit us to move about and work with our hoes About seven o'clock in the morning the overseer sounded his horn and we all repaired to the shade of some perscimmon trees which grew in a corner of the field to get our breakfast I here saw a cart drawn by a yoke of oxen driven by an old black man nearly blind The cart contained three barrels filled with water and several large baskets full of corn bread that had been baked in the ashes The water was for us to drink and the bread was our breakfast The little son of the overseer was also in the cart and had brought with him the breakfast of his father in a small wooden bucket The overseer had bread butter cold ham and coffee for his breakfast Ours was composed of a corn cake weighing about three quarters of a pound to each person with as much water as was desired I at first supposed that this bread was dealt out to the people as their allowance but on further inquiry I found this not to be the case Simon by whose side I was now at work and who seemed much pleased with my agility and diligence in my duty told me that here as well as every where in this country each person received a peck of corn at the crib door every Sunday evening and that in ordinary times every one had to grind this corn and bake it for him or herself making such use of it as the owner thought proper but that for some time past the overseer for the purpose of saving the time which had been lost in baking the bread had made it the duty of an old woman who was not capable of doing much work in the field to stay at the quarter and bake the bread of the whole gang When baked it was brought to the field in a cart as I saw and dealt out in loaves They still had to grind their own corn after night and as there were only three hand-mills on the plantation he they experienced much difficulty in converting their corn into meal We worked in this field all day and at the end of every hour or hour and a quarter we had permission to go to the cart which was moved about the field so as to be near us and get water Our dinner was the same in all respects as our breakfast except that in addition to the bread we had a little salt and a radish for each person We were not allowed to rest at either breakfast or dinner longer than while we were eating and we worked in the evening as long as we could distinguish the weeds from the cotton plants Simon informed me that formerly when they baked their own bread they had left their work soon after sundown to go home and bake for the next day but the overseer had adopted the new policy for the purpose of keeping them at work until dark When we could no longer see to work the horn was again sounded and we returned home I had now lived through one of the days--a succession of which make up the life of a slave--on a cotton plantation As we went out in the morning I observed several women who carried their young children in their arms to the field These mothers laid their children at the side of the fence or under the shade of the cotton plants whilst they were at work and when the rest of us went to get water they would go to give suck to their children requesting some one to bring them water in gourds which they were careful to carry to the field with them One young woman did not like the others leave her child at the end of the row but had contrived a sort of rude knapsack made of a piece of coarse linen cloth in which she fastened her child which was very young upon her back and in this way carried it all day and performed her task at the hoe with the other people I pitied this woman and as we were going home at night I came near her and spoke to her Perceiving as soon as she spoke that she had not been brought up amongst the slaves of this plantation-- for her language was different from theirs--I asked her why she did not do as the other women did and leave her child at the end of the row in the shade Indeed she I cannot leave my child in the weeds amongst the snakes What would be my feelings if I should leave it there and a scorpion were to bite it Besides my child cries so piteously when I leave it alone in the field that I cannot bear to hear it Poor thing I wish we were both in the grave where all sorrow is forgotten I asked this woman who did not appear to be more than twenty years old how long she had been here and where she came from I have been here she almost two years and came from the Eastern Shore I once lived as well as any lady in Maryland I was born a slave in the family of a gentleman whose name was Le Compt My master was a man of property lived on his estate and entertained much company My mistress who was very kind to me made me her nurse when I was about ten years old and put me to live with her own children I grew up amongst her daughters not as their equal and companion but as a favoured and indulged servant I was always well dressed and received a portion of all the delicacies of their table I wanted nothing and had not the trouble of providing even for myself I believe there was not a happier being in the world than I was At present none can be more wretched When I was yet a child my master had given me to his oldest daughter who was about one year older than I was To her I had always looked as my future mistress and expected that whenever she became a wife I should follow her person and cease to be a member of the family of her father When I was almost seventeen my young mistress married a gentleman of the Eastern Shore of Virginia who had been addressing her more than a year Soon after the wedding was over my new master removed his wife to his own residence and took me and a black boy of my own age that the lady's father had given her with him He had caused it to be reported in Maryland that he was very wealthy and was the owner of a plantation with a large stock of slaves and other property It was supposed at the time of the marriage that my young mistress was making a very good match and all her friends were pleased with it When her lover came to visit her he always rode in a handsome gig accompanied by a black man on horseback as his servant This man told us in the kitchen that his master was one of the most fashionable men in Virginia was a man of large fortune and that all the young ladies in the county he lived in had their eyes upon him These stories I repeated carefully to my young mistress and added every persuasion that I could think of to induce her to accept her lover as her husband My feelings had become deeply interested in the issue of this matter for whilst the master was striving to win the heart of my young mistress the servant had already conquered mine It was more than a hundred miles from the residence of my old master to that of my young one and when we arrived at the latter place my mistress and I soon found that we had been equally credulous and were equally deceived We were taken to an old dilapidated mansion which was quite in keeping with every thing on the estate to which it was attached The house was almost without furniture and there were no servants in it except myself and my companion The black man who had so effectually practiced upon me belonged to one of my new master's companions--and had a wife and three children in the neighbourhood My mistress soon discovered that her husband's companions were gamblers and horse racers who frequently convened at her house to concert or mature some scheme the object of which was to cheat some one My old master was a member of the church and was very scrupulous in the observance of his moral duties His precepts had been deeply implanted in the mind of my young mistress and the society of these sportsmen as the friends of my young master denominated themselves became so revolting to her feelings that after she had been married nearly a year and had exhausted all her patience and all her fortitude in endeavouring to reclaim her husband from the vile associations and pursuits by which his time and his affections were engaged she determined at last to return to her father for a time and to take me with her for the purpose of ascertaining whether this would not bring him to reflect upon the wrong he had done her as well as himself She communicated to me her designs and we were waiting for an opportunity of carrying them into effect when one evening near sundown my master came to me in the kitchen and told me he wished me to go to the house of a gentleman who lived about a mile distant and deliver a letter for him without letting my mistress know any thing of the matter I immediately set out expecting to return in half an hour As I left the house I saw my mistress in the garden and I never saw her again Between the house of my master and that to which he had sent me was a grove of young pine trees that had grown up in a field that had formerly been cultivated but which had been neglected on account of its poverty for many years Through this thicket the path which I had to travel led and when near the middle of the wood I saw a white man step into the path only a few yards before me with a rope in his hand Sometime before this my mistress had told me that she wished to get me back to her father's house in Maryland because she was afraid that my master would sell me to the negro buyers and the moment I saw the man with the rope in my path the words of my mistress were recollected I screamed and turned to fly towards home but at the first step was met by the coloured man who had attended my master as his servant when he visited Maryland at the time he was courting my mistress--and who had made so deep an impression on my heart This was the first time I had seen him since I came to live in Virginia and base as I knew he must be from his former conduct to me yet at sight of him my former affection for a moment revived and I rushed into his arms which were extended towards me hoping that he would save me from the danger I so much dreaded from behind He saw that I was frightened and had fled to him for protection and only 'Come with me' I followed him more by instinct than by reason and holding to his arm ran as fast as I could-- I knew not whither I did not observe whether we were on the path or not I do not know how far we had run when he stopped and --'We must remain here for some time' In a few minutes the white man whom I had seen in the path came up with us and seizing me by the hands he and my pretended protector bound them together at my back and to suppress my cries tied a large handkerchief round my head and over my mouth It was now becoming dark and they hurried out of the wood and across the fields to a small creek the water of which fell into the Chesapeake Bay Here was a boat and another white man in it They forced me on board and the white men taking the oars whilst the black managed the rudder we were quickly out in the bay and in less than an hour I was on board a small schooner lying at anchor where I found eleven others who like myself had been dragged from their homes and their friends to be sold to the southern traders I have no doubt that my master had sold me without the knowledge of my mistress and that he endeavoured to persuade her that I had run away perhaps he was successful in this endeavour I heard no more of my mistress for whom I was very sorry for I knew she would be greatly distressed at losing me The vessel remained at anchor where we found her that night and the next day until evening when she made sail and beat up the bay all night against a head wind When she approached the western shore she hoisted a red handkerchief at her mast head and a boat came off from the land large enough to carry us all and we were removed to a house on the bank of York river where I found about thirty men and women all imprisoned in the cellar of a small tavern The men were in irons but the women were not bound with any thing The cords and handkerchief had been taken from me whilst on board the vessel We remained at York river more than a week and whilst there twenty-five or thirty persons were brought in and shut up with us When we commenced our journey for the south we were about sixty in number The men were chained together but the women were all left quite at liberty At the end of three weeks we reached Savannah river opposite the town of Augusta where we were sold out by our owner Our present master was there and purchased me and another woman who has been at work in the field to-day Soon after I was brought home the overseer compelled me to be married to a man I did not like He is a native of Africa and still retains the manners and religion of his country He has not been with us to day as he is sick and under the care of the doctor I must hasten home to get my supper and go to rest and glad I should be if I were never to rise again I have several times been whipped unmercifully because I was not strong enough to do as much work with the hoe as the other women who have lived all their lives on this plantation and have been accustomed from their infancy to work in the field For a long time after I was brought here I thought it would be impossible for me to live on the coarse and scanty food with which we are supplied When I contrast my former happiness with my present misery I pray for death to deliver me from my sufferings I was deeply affected by the narrative of this woman and as we had loitered on our way it was already dark whilst we were at some distance from the quarter but the sound of the overseer's horn here interrupted our conversation--at hearing which she exclaimed We are too late let us run or we shall be whipped and setting off as fast as she could carry her child she left me alone A moment's reflection however convinced me that I too had better quicken my pace--I quickly passed the woman encumbered with her infant and arrived in the crowd of the people some time perhaps a minute before her X AT the time I joined the company the overseer was calling over the names of the whole from a little book and the first name that I heard was that of my companion whom I had just left which was Lydia--called by him Lyd As she did not answer I Master Lydia the woman that carries the baby on her back will be here in a minute-- I left her just behind The overseer took no notice of what I but went on with his roll-call As the people answered to their names they passed off to the cabins except three--two women and a man who when their names were called were ordered to go into the yard in front of the overseer's house My name was the last on the list and when it was called I was ordered into the yard with the three others Just as we had entered Lydia came up out of breath with the child in her arms and following us into the yard dropped on her knees before the overseer and begged him to forgive her Where have you been he Poor Lydia now burst into tears and I only stopped to talk awhile to this man pointing to me but indeed master overseer I will never do so again Lie down was his reply Lydia immediately fell prostrate upon the ground and in this position he compelled her to remove her old tow linen shift the only garment she wore so as to expose her hips when he gave her ten lashes with his long whip every touch of which brought blood and a shriek from the sufferer He then ordered her to go and get her supper with an injunction never to stay behind again The other three culprits were then put upon their trial The first was a middle aged woman who had as her overseer left several hills of cotton in the course of the day without cleaning and hilling them in a proper manner She received twelve lashes The other two were charged in general terms with having been lazy and of having neglected their work that day Each of these received twelve lashes These people all received punishment in the same manner that it had been inflicted upon Lydia and when they were all gone the overseer turned to me and --Boy you are a stranger here yet but I called you in to let you see how things are done here and to give you a little advice When I get a new negro under my command I never whip at first I always give him a few days to learn his duty unless he is an outrageous villain in which case I anoint him a little at the beginning I call over the names of all the hands twice every week on Wednesday and Saturday evenings and settle with them according to their general conduct for the last three days I call the names of my captains every morning and it is their business to see that they have all their hands in their proper places You ought not to have staid behind to-night with Lyd but as this is your first offence I shall overlook it and you may go and get your supper I made a low bow and thanked master overseer for his kindness to me and left him This night for supper we had corn bread and cucumbers but we had neither salt vinegar nor pepper with the cucumbers I had never before seen people flogged in the way our overseer flogged his people This plan of making the person who is to be whipped lie down upon the ground was new to me though it is much practised in the south and I have since seen men and women too cut nearly in pieces by this mode of punishment It has one advantage over tying people up by the hands as it prevents all accidents from sprains in the thumbs or wrists I have known people to hurt their joints very much by struggling when tied up by the thumbs or wrists to undergo a severe whipping The method of ground whipping as it is called is in my opinion very indecent as it compels females to expose themselves in a very shameful manner The whip used by the overseers on the cotton plantations is different from all other whips that I have ever seen The staff is about twenty or twenty-two inches in length with a large and heavy head which is often loaded with a quarter or half a pound of lead wrapped in cat-gut and securely fastened on so that nothing but the greatest violence can separate it from the staff The lash is ten feet long made of small strips of buckskin tanned so as to be dry and hard and plaited carefully and closely together of the thickness in the largest part of a man's little finger but quite small at each extremity At the farthest end of this thong is attached a cracker nine inches in length made of strong sewing silk twisted and knotted until it feels as firm as the hardest twine This whip in an unpractised hand is a very awkward and inefficient weapon but the best qualification of the overseer of a cotton plantation is the ability of using this whip with adroitness and when wielded by an experienced arm it is one of the keenest instruments of torture ever invented by the ingenuity of man The cat-o'-nine tails used in the British military service is but a clumsy instrument beside this whip which has superseded the cow-hide the hickory and every other species of lash on the cotton plantations The cow-hide and hickory bruise and mangle the flesh of the sufferer but this whip cuts when expertly applied almost as keen as a knife and never bruises the flesh nor injures the bones It was now Saturday night and I wished very much for Sunday morning to come that I might see the manner of spending the Sabbath on a great cotton plantation I expected that as these people had been compelled to work so hard and fare so poorly all the week they would be inclined to repose themselves on Sunday and that the morning of this day would be passed in quietness if not in sleep by the inhabitants of our quarter No horn was blown by the overseer to awaken us this morning and I slept in my little loft until it was quite day but when I came down I found our small community a scene of universal bustle and agitation Here it is necessary to make my readers acquainted with the rules of polity which governed us on Sunday for I now speak of myself as one of the slaves on this plantation and with the causes which gave rise to these rules All over the south the slaves are discouraged as much as possible and by all possible means from going to any place of religious worship on Sunday This is to prevent them from associating together from different estates and distant parts of the country and plotting conspiracies and insurrections On some estates the overseers are required to prohibit the people from going to meeting off the plantation at any time under the severest penalties While preachers cannot come upon the plantations to preach to the people without first obtaining permission of the master and afterwards procuring the sanction of the overseer No slave dare leave the plantation to which he belongs a single mile without a written pass from the overseer or master but by exposing himself to the danger of being taken up and flogged Any white man who meets a slave off the plantation without a pass has a right to take him up and flog him at his discretion All these causes combined operate powerfully to keep the slave at home But in addition to those principles of restraint it is a rule on every plantation that no overseer ever departs from to flog every slave male or female that leaves the estate for a single hour by night or by day--Sunday not excepted-- without a written pass The overseer who should permit the people under his charge to go about the neighbourhood without a pass would soon lose his character and no one would employ him nor would his reputation less certainly suffer in the estimation of the planters were he to fall into the practice of granting passes except on the most urgent occasions and for purposes generally to be specified in the pass A cotton planter has no more idea of permitting his slaves to go at will about the neighbourhood on Sunday than a farmer in Pennsylvania has of letting his horses out of his field on that day Nor would the neighbours be less inclined to complain of the annoyance in the former than in the latter case There has always been a strong repugnance amongst the planters against their slaves becoming members of any religious society Not as I believe because they are so maliciously disposed towards their people as to wish to deprive them of the comforts of religion--provided the principles of religion did not militate against the principles of slavery-- but they fear that the slaves by attending meetings and listening to the preachers may imbibe with the morality they teach the notions of equality and liberty contained in the gospel This I have no doubt is the ground of all the dissatisfaction that the planters express with the itinerant preachers who have from time to time sought opportunities of instructing the slaves in their religious duties The cotton planters have always since I knew any thing of them been most careful to prevent the slaves from learning to read and such is the gross ignorance that prevails that many of them could not name the four cardinal points At the time I first went to Carolina there were a great many African slaves in the country and they continued to come in for several years afterwards I became intimately acquainted with some of these men Many of them believed there were several gods some of whom were good and others evil and they prayed as much to the latter as to the former I knew several who must have been from what I have since learned Mohamedans though at that time I had never heard of the religion of Mohamed There was one man on this plantation who prayed five times every day always turning his face to the east when in the performance of his devotion There is in general very little sense of religious obligation or duty amongst the slaves on the cotton plantations and Christianity cannot be with propriety called the religion of these people They are universally subject to the grossest and most abject superstition and uniformly believe in witchcraft conjuration and the agency of evil spirits in the affairs of human life Far the greater part of them are either natives of Africa or the descendants of those who have always from generation to generation lived in the south since their ancestors were landed on this continent and their superstition for it does not deserve the name of religion is no better nor is it less ferocious than that which oppresses the inhabitants of the wildest regions of Negro-land They have not the slightest religious regard for the Sabbath-day and their masters make no efforts to impress them with the least respect for this sacred institution My first Sunday on this plantation was but a prelude to all that followed and I shall here give an account of it At the time I rose this morning it wanted only about fifteen or twenty minutes of sunrise and a large number of the men as well as some of the women had already quitted the quarter and gone about the business of the day That is they had gone to work for wages for themselves--in this manner our overseer had about two miles off a field of near twenty acres planted in cotton on his own account He was the owner of this land but as he had no slaves he was obliged to hire people to work it for him or let it lie waste He had procured this field to be cleared as I was told partly by letting white men make tar and turpentine from the pine wood grew on it and partly by hiring slaves to work upon it on Sunday About twenty of our people went to work for him to-day for which he gave them fifty cents each Several of the others perhaps forty in all went out through the neighbourhood to work for other planters On every plantation with which I ever had any acquaintance the people are allowed to make patches as they are called--that is gardens in some remote and unprofitable part of the estate generally in the woods in which they plant corn potatoes pumpkins melons c for themselves These patches they must cultivate on Sunday or let them go uncultivated I think that on this estate there were about thirty of these patches cleared in the woods and fenced--some with rails and others with brush--the property of the various families The vegetables that grow in these patches were always consumed in the families of the owners and the money that was earned by hiring out was spent in various ways sometimes for clothes sometimes for better food than was allowed by the overseer and sometimes for rum but those who drank rum had to do it by stealth By the time the sun was up an hour this morning our quarter was nearly as quiet and clear of inhabitants as it had been at the same period on the previous day As I had nothing to do for myself I went with Lydia whose husband was still sick to help her to work in her patch which was about a mile and a half from our dwelling We took with us some bread and a large bucket of water and worked all day She had onions cabbages cucumbers melons and many other things in her garden In the evening as we returned home we were joined by the man who prayed five times a day and at the going down of the sun he stopped and prayed aloud in our hearing in a language I did not understand This man told me he formerly lived on the confines of a country which had no trees nor grass upon it and that in some places no water was to be found for several days' journey That this barren country was nevertheless inhabited by a race of men who had many camels and goats and some horses They had no settled place of residence but removed from one part of the country to another in quest of places Where green herbage was to be found--their chief food being the milk of their camels and goats but that they also ate the flesh of these animals sometimes The hair of those people was not short and woolly like that of the negroes nor were they of a shining black They were continually at war with some of the neighbouring people and very often with his own countrymen He was himself once taken prisoner by them when a lad in a great battle fought between them and his own people in which his party were defeated The victors kept him in their possession more than two years compelling him to attend to their camels and goats Whilst he was with these people they travelled a great way towards the rising sun and came to a river running through a country inhabited by yellow people where the land was very rich and produced great quantities of rice such as grows here-- and many other kinds of grain The people who had taken him prisoner professed the same religion that he did and it was forbidden by its precepts for one an to sell another into slavery who held the same faith with himself otherwise he should have been sold to these yellow people In the river of this country be saw alligators in great abundance like those that he had seen in Carolina and the musquitos were in some places so numerous that it was difficult to breathe without inhaling them When we turned the camels out to graze we used tie their fore-feet together with a rope made of the hair of this animal spun upon small sticks and twisted into a rope Sometimes they broke these ropes and slipped their feet out of its coils and it was then very difficult to retake them They would sometimes strike off at a trot across the open country and we would be obliged to mount other camels and follow them for a day or two before we could retake them I had been with these people so long and being of the same religion with themselves had become so familiar with their customs and manner of life that they seemed almost to regard me as one of their own nation and frequently sent me alone in pursuit of the stray camels giving me instructions how to direct my course so as to rejoin them for they never waited for me to return to them at the place where I left them if the beasts had consumed the bushes and green herbage growing there before I came back When I had been a captive with them fully two years we came one evening and encamped at a little well the mouth of which was about a yard over and the water in which was very sweet and good This well seemed to have been scooped out of the hard and flinty sand with men's hands and was scarcely more than four feet deep though it contained an abundant supply of water We encamped by this fountain all night and I remembered that we had been at the same place soon after I was made a prisoner and that when we had formerly come to it we travelled with our backs to the mid-day sun There was no herbage hereabout except a few stunted and thorny bushes and in wandering abroad in quest of something to eat one of the best and fleetest camels entangled the rope which bound his fore-feet amongst these bushes and broke it I found part of the rope fast to a bush in the morning but the camel was at a great distance from us towards the setting sun The chief of our party ordered me to mount another camel and go with a long rope in pursuit of the stray and told me that they should travel towards the south that day and encamp at a place where there was much grass I went in pursuit of the lost camel but when I came near him he took off at a great trot over the country--and I pursued him until noon without ever being able to overtake him or even to change the line of his march His course was towards the south-west and when I found it impossible to overtake him as his speed was superior to that of the beast I rode I resolved to strive to accomplish that by stratagem which force could not effect I knew the beasts were both hungry and that having received as much water as they could drink the night before they would devour with the utmost avidity the first green herbage that they might meet with I slackened the speed of my camel and followed at a leisure gait after the one I pursued suffering him to leave me behind him at a considerable distance He still however kept on in the same direction and with nearly the same speed with which he had advanced all the morning so that it became necessary for me to quicken my pace to prevent him from passing out of my sight and escaping from me altogether About five o'clock in the afternoon I came in sight of trees the tops of which were only visible across the open plain The camel I rode was now as desirous to advance rapidly as his leader had been throughout the day I was carried forward as quickly as the swiftest horse could trot and awhile before sundown I approached a small grove of tall straight trees which are greatly valued in Africa and which bear large quantities of nuts of a very good quality Under and about these trees was a small tract of ground covered with long green grass and here my stray camel stopped I have no doubt that he had scented the odour of this grass soon after I first gave chase to him in the morning though the distance at which he was from it was so great that the best horse could not have travelled it in one day When I came up to the trees I dismounted from the camel I rode and tying its feet together with a short rope preserved my long one for the purpose of taking the runaway I gathered as many nuts as I could eat and after satisfying my hunger lay down to sleep This was the first time that I had ever attempted to pass a night alone in this open country and after I had made my bed in the grass I became fearful that some wild beast might fall in with me before morning as I had often heard lions and other creatures of prey breaking the stillness of night in those desolate regions by their yells and roaring I therefore ascended a tree and placed myself amongst some spreading limbs in such a position as to be in no danger of falling even if I should be overtaken by sleep The moon was now full and in that country where there are no clouds and where there is seldom any dew objects can be distinguished at the distance of several miles over the plains by moonlight When I had been in the tree about an hour I heard at a great distance a loud sullen noise between a growl and a roar which I knew to proceed from a lion for I was well acquainted with the habits and noise of this animal having frequently assisted in hunting him in my own country I was greatly terrified by this circumstance not for my own safety for I knew that no beast of prey could reach me in the tree but I feared that my camels might be devoured and I be left to perish in the desert My fears were in part well founded for keeping my eye steadily directed towards the point from which the sound had proceeded it was not long before I saw some object moving over the naked plain The runaway camel now joined his tethered companion and both quitting the herbage came and stood at the root of the tree upon the branches of which I was I still kept my eye steadily fixed upon the moving body which was evidently advancing nearer to me over the plain I had no longer any doubt that it was coming to the grove of trees which were only twelve or fifteen in number and so bare of branches that I could distinctly see in every direction around me In a few minutes the animal approached me It was a monstrous lion of the black maned species It was now within one hundred paces of me and the poor camels raised their heads as high as they could towards me and crouched close to the trunk of the tree apparently so stupified by fear as to be incapable of attempting to fly The lion approached with a kind of motion and at length dropping on its belly glided along the ground until within about ten yards of the tree when uttering a terrific roar which shook the stillness of the night for many a league around he sprang upon and seized the unbound camel by the neck Finding that I afforded no protection the animal after striving in vain to shake off his assailant rushed out upon the open plain carrying on his back the lion which I could perceive had already fastened upon the throat of his victim which did not go more than a stone's cast from the trees before he fell and after a short struggle ceased to move his limbs The lion held the poor beast by the throat for some time after he was dead and until I suppose the blood had ceased to flow from his veins--then quitting the neck he turned to the side of the slain and tearing a hole into the cavity of the body extracted the intestines and devoured the liver and heart before he began to gorge himself with the flesh The moon was now high in the heavens and shone with such exceeding brilliancy that I could see distinctly for many miles round me In that country the smooth and glittering surface of the hard and baked sandy plains reflects the light of the moon as strongly as a sheet of snow in winter does in this and the atmosphere being free from all humidity is so clear and transparent that I could perceive the quivering motion of the camel's lips in his last agony as well as the tongue of the lion when he licked the blood from his paws As soon my fright had a little subsided I looked for my surviving camel which to my terror I could not see either at the foot of the tree on which I was and where I had last seen it or any where in the grove I now concluded that in the alarm caused by the lion and the destruction of his companion my surviving beast had broken the cord which bound its feet and had taken to flight leaving me alone and without any means of escaping from the desert for I had no hope of being able to reach on foot either the people with whom I had so long lived or the inhabitants of the woody countries lying far to the south of me No condition can be more miserable than that to which I was now reduced My late masters were distant from me at least one day's journey on a swift camel and were removing farther from me every day as fast as their beasts could carry them and I had no knowledge of the various watering places and spots of herbage which lie scattered over the wide expanse of those unfrequented regions in the midst of which I then was I had not seen any water at this place since I came to it and had not the poor consolation of knowing that I could remain here and live on the fruit of the trees until some chance should bring hither some of the wandering tribes that roam over those solitudes After a lapse of two or three hours not being able to discover my living camel anywhere although the moon had now passed her meridian and shone with a splendour which enabled me to distinguish small pebbles at some distance I gave him up for lost and again turned my attention to the lion which still continued at intervals to utter deep and sullen growls over his prey I expected that at the approach of day the lion would leave the dead carcass and retire to his lair in some distant place and I determined to await the period of his departure to descend the tree and search for water amongst the grass which rose in some places to the height of my shoulders I slept none this night--but from my couch in the boughs watched the motions of the lion which after swallowing at least one third of the camel stretched himself at full length on his belly about twenty paces from it and laying his head between his fore-feet prepared to guard his spoil against all the intruders of the night In this position he remained until the sun was up in the morning and began to dart his rays across the naked and parched plain upon which he lay--when rising and stretching himself he walked slowly towards the grove-- passed under me--went to the other side of the trees and entered some very tall herbage where I heard him lap water I now knew that I was in no danger of dying from thirst provided I could escape wild beasts on my way to and from the fountain The trees afforded me both food and shelter but I quickly found myself deprived of lasting water at the present--for the lion after slaking his thirst returned by the same way that he had gone to the water and coming to the tree in the boughs of which I lay rubbed himself against its trunk raising his tail and exposing his sides alternately to the friction of the rough bark After continuing this exercise for some time he rested his weight on his hind-feet licked his breast fore-legs and paws and then lying down on his side in the shade appeared to fall into a deep sleep Great as my anxiety was to leave my present lodgings I dared not attempt to pass the sentinel that kept guard at the root of the tree even though he slept on his post for whenever I made the least rustling it the branches I perceived that he moved his ears and opened his eyes but closed the latter again when the noise ceased The lion lay all day under the tree only removing so as to place himself in the shade in the afternoon but soon after the sun descended below the horizon in the evening he aroused himself and resting upon his hind-feet as he had done in the morning uttered a roar that shook all the leaves about my head and caused a tremulous motion in the branches upon which I rested This horrid noise together with the sight of the great beast that uttered it so agitated my whole frame that I was near leaping from my seat and falling to the ground I was so overcome with fear that all prudence and self-possession forsook me and I uttered a loud shout as if in defiance of the monster below me The moment the lion heard my voice he raised his head looked directly at me with his fiery eyes and crouched down in the attitude of springing but perceiving me to be quite out of the reach of his longest leap he walked slowly off and lay down about half way between me and the dead camel with his head towards my tree I had no doubt that his object was to watch me until my descent from the tree that he might make his supper of me this night as he had of my camel the night before I had now been without water two days--my thirst was tormenting and I had no prospect before me but of remaining in this tree until driven to delirium for water I should voluntarily descend and deliver myself into the jaws of my enemy The moon did not rise this night until long after the disappearance of daylight but in the country where I then was the stars shed such abundant light that objects of magnitude can be seen at a great distance by their rays without the aid of the moon The lion moved frequently from place to place but I could perceive that his attention was still fixed upon me at last however be started away across the plain and went farther and farther from me until at length I lost sight of him in the distance and all remained as quiet and noiseless in the immense expanse around me as the land of the dead I now thought of descending to go in quest of water but whilst I deliberated upon this subject the moon rose and cast her broad and glorious light upon these wide fields of desolation As I could now see every thing I resolved to descend but before doing this thought it prudent to cast a look about me to see if there might not be some other beast of prey near This thought saved my life for on turning my eyes in a direction quite different from that in which the lion had departed I saw him returning within two or three stone's cast creeping along the ground I watched him and he came and placed himself between me and the water All was again silent and I remained in the tree burning with thirst until the moon was elevated high in the heavens when the silence was interrupted by the roaring of a lion at a great distance which was again repeated after a short interval At the end of half an hour I again heard the same lion apparently not far off Casting my eye in the direction of the sound I saw the beast advancing rapidly as I thought towards me and began to apprehend that a whole den of lions were lying in wait for me The stranger soon undeceived me for he was coming to partake of the dead camel whose flesh or blood he had doubtlessly smelled though it was not putrid for in this dry atmosphere flesh is preserved a long time free from taint and is sometimes dried in the sun in a state of perfect soundness I knew the nature of the lion too well to suppose that the stranger was going to get his supper free of cost and before he had reached the carcass my jailer quitted his post and set off to defend his acquisition of the last night The new comer arrived first and fell upon the dead camel with the fury of a hungry lion--as he was but he had scarcely swallowed a second morsel when the rightful owner uttering a roar yet more dreadful than any that had preceded it leaped upon the intruder and brought him to the ground For a moment I heard nothing but the gnashing of teeth the clashing of talons and the sounds caused by the laceration of the flesh and hides of the combatants but anon they rolled along the ground and filled the whole canopy of heaven with their yells of rage--then the roaring would cease and only the rending of the flesh of these lords of the waste could be heard--then the roaring would again burst forth with renewed energy This battle lasted more than an hour but at length both appearing to be exhausted they lay for some minutes on their sides each with the other wrapped in his fierce embrace In the end I perceived that one of them rose and walked away leaving the other upon the ground The victor which I could perceive was the stranger for his mane was not black returned to the remnant of the camel and lay down panting beside it After he had taken time to breathe he recommenced his attack and consumed far the larger part of the carcass Having eaten to fulness he took up the bones and remaining flesh of the camel and set out across the desert--I followed him with my eye for more than an hour Parched as my throat was but still afraid to descend from my place of safety I remained on the tree until the light of the next morning when I examined carefully around to see that there was no beast of prey lurking about the place where I knew the water to be Perceiving no danger I descended before the sun was up and going to the water knelt down and drank as long and as much as I thought I could with safety I then proceeded to make a more minute examination of this place and saw numerous tracks of wild goats and of other animals that had come here as well to drink as to eat the grass I also saw the tracks of lions and other beasts of prey which satisfied me that these had come to lie in wait for other animals coming to drink it also convinced me that it was not safe for me to remain in this grove alone but I knew of no means by which I could escape from it It now occurred to my mind that if my living camel had not escaped from me I might have made my way to my own country for on my camel I had two leather bottles which I had neglected to fill with water the morning I left the company of my former masters By replenishing these from the fountain giving my camel as much as he could drink and filling two small sacks attached to my saddle with the nuts from these trees I should have been equipped for a journey of ten days within which period I had no doubt I should have been able to reach my own people but my camel was gone and reflections served only to aggravate the bitterness of my anguish I walked out upon the desert and prayed to be delivered from the perils that environed me At the distance of two or three miles from me I now observed small sand hill rising to the height of eight or ten feet easily perceived when looking along the level surface of the ground but which had escaped my observation from my elevated post in the tree Such sand hills are often found in those deserts and sometimes contain the bones of men and animals that have been buried in them In my situation I could not remain idle and urged forward by restlessness bordering on despair resolved to go to the little hill before me without having any definite object in view I soon approached the hill and having reached its foot walked along its base for some distance I then turned to go back to the trees but after advancing a few steps was seized with a sudden impulse which urged me to go to the top of the sand hill I again turned and walked slowly to the summit beyond which I saw only the same dreary expanse that I was so well used to look upon Advancing along the top of this sand hill which had been blown up by the wind in a long narrow ridge I saw a recess or hollow place on the side opposite to that by which I had ascended it and on coming to this spot beheld my camel crouched down close to the ground with his neck extended at full length My joy was unbounded--I leaped with delight and was wild for some minutes with a delirium of gladness My camel had fled from the grove at the time his companion was killed by the lion and reaching this place had here taken refuge and had not moved since I hastened to loose his feet from the cords with which I had bound them mounted upon his back and was quickly at the watering place I filled my two water skins with water and gathering any nuts as my sacks would contain caused my camel to take a full draught and fill his stomach with grass and then directed my course to the south with a quick pace It was now noon when I left this watering place and I travelled hard all that day and the succeeding night until the moon rose I then alighted and causing my camel to lie down crept close to his side and betook myself to sleep I rested well this night and recommencing my journey at the dawn of day I pursued my route without any thing worthy of relating happening to me until the eighth day when I discovered trees and all the appearance of a woody country before me Soon after entering the forest I came to a small stream of water Descending this stream a few miles I found some people who were cutting grass for the purpose of making mats to sleep on These people spoke my own language and told me that one of them had been in my native village lately They took me and my camel to their village and treated me very kindly promising me that after I had recovered from my fatigue they would go with me to my friends My protectors were at war with a nation whose religion was different from ours and about a month after I came to the village we were alarmed one morning just at break of day by the horrible uproar caused by mingled shouts of men and blows given with heavy sticks upon large wooden drums The village was surrounded by enemies who attacked us with clubs long wooden spears and bows and arrows After fighting for more than an hour those who were not fortunate enough to run away were made prisoners It was not the object of our enemies to kill they wished to take us alive and sell us as slaves I was knocked down by a heavy blow of a club and when I recovered from the stupor that followed I found myself tied fast with the long rope that I had brought from the desert and in which I had formerly led the camels of my masters We were immediately led away from this village through the forest and were compelled to travel all day as fast as we could walk We had nothing to eat on this journey but a small quantity of grain taken with ourselves This grain we were compelled to carry on our backs and roast by the fires which we kindled at nights to frighten away the wild beasts We travelled three weeks in the woods--sometimes without any path at all and arrived one day at a large river with a rapid current Here we were forced to help our conquerors to roll a great number of dead trees into the water from a vast pile that had been thrown together by high floods These trees being dry and light floated high out of the water and when several of the were fastened together with the tough branches of young trees formed a raft upon which we all placed ourselves and descended the river for three days when we came in sight of what appeared to me the most wonderful object in the world this was a large ship at anchor in the river When our raft came near the ship the white people--for such they were on board--assisted to take us on deck and the logs were suffered to float down the river I had never seen white people before and they appeared to me the ugliest creatures in the world The persons who brought us down the river received payment for us of the people in the ship in various articles of which I remember that a keg of liquor and some yards of blue and red cotton cloth were the principal At the time we came into this ship she was full of black people who were all confined in a dark and low place in irons The women were in irons as well as the men About twenty persons were seized in our village at the time I was and amongst these were three children so young that they were not able to walk or to eat any hard substance The mothers of these children had brought them all the way with them and had them in their arms when we were taken on board this ship When they put us in irons to be sent to our place of confinement in the ship the men who the irons on these others took the children out of their hands and threw the over the side of the ship into the water When this was done two of the women leaped overboard after the children-- the third was already confined by a chain to another woman and could not get into the water but in struggling to disengage herself she broke her arm and died a few days after of a fever One of the two women who were in the river was carried down by the weight of her irons before she could be rescued but the other was taken up by some men in a boat and brought on board This woman threw herself overboard one night when we were at sea The weather was very hot whilst we lay in the river and many of us died every day but the number brought on board greatly exceeded those who died and at the end of two weeks the place in which we were confined was so full that no one could lie down and we were obliged to sit all the time for the room was not high enough for us to stand When our prison would hold no more the ship sailed down the river and on the night of the second day after she sailed I heard the roaring of the ocean as it dashed against her sides After we had been at sea some days the irons were removed from the women and they were permitted to go upon deck but whenever the wind blew high they were driven down amongst us We had nothing to eat but yams which were thrown amongst us at random--and of these we had scarcely enough to support life More than one-third of us died on the passage and when we arrived at Charleston I was not able to stand It was more than a week after I left the ship before I could straighten my limbs I was bought by a trader with several others brought up the country and sold to our present master I have been here five years IX It was dusky twilight when this narrative was ended and we hastened home to the quarter When we arrived the overseer had not yet come He had been at his cotton field with the people he had hired in the morning to work for him but he soon made his appearance and going into his house came out with a small bag of money and paid each one the price he had a right to receive In this transaction the overseer acted with entire fairness to the people who worked for him and with the exception of the moral turpitude of violating the Sabbath in this shameful manner the business was conducted with propriety I must here observe that when the slaves go out to work for wages on Sunday their employers never flog them and so far as I know never give them abusive language I have often hired myself to work on Sunday and have been employed in this way by more than twenty different persons not one of whom ever insulted or maltreated me in any way They seldom took the trouble of coming to look at me until towards evening and sometimes not them I worked faithfully because I knew that if I did not I could not expect payment and those who hired me knew that if I did not work well they need not employ me The practice of working on Sunday is so universal amongst the slaves on the cotton plantations that the immorality of the matter is never spoken of We retired to test this evening at the usual hour and no one could have known by either our appearance or our manners that this was Sunday evening There were no clean clothes amongst us for few of our people were acquainted with the luxury of a suit of clean vestments and those who could afford a clean garment reserved it for Monday morning Sunday is the customary wash-day on cotton plantations It is here proper to observe that it is usual on the cotton estates to deal out the weekly allowance of corn to the slaves on Sunday evening but our overseer at this period had changed this business from Sunday to Monday morning for the reason I believe that he wished to keep the hired people at work in his own cotton field until night He however soon afterwards resumed the practice of distributing the allowance on Sunday evening and continued it as long as I remained on the estate The business was conducted in the same manner when performed on Sunday as when attended to on Monday only the time was changed On Monday morning I heard the sound of the horn at the usual hour and repairing to the front of the overseer's house found that he had already gone to the corn crib for the purpose of distributing corn amongst the people for the bread of the week or rather for the week's subsistence for this corn was all the provision that our master or his overseer usually made for us--I say usually for whatever was given to us beyond the corn which we received on Sunday evening was considered in the light of a bounty bestowed upon us over and beyond what we were entitled to or had a right to expect to receive When I arrived at the crib the door was unlocked and open and the distribution had already commenced Each person was entitled to half a bushel of ears of corn which was measured out by several of the men who were in the crib Every child above six months old drew this weekly allowance of corn and in this way women who had several small children had more corn than they could consume and sometimes bartered small quantities with the other people for such things as they needed and were not able to procure The people received their corn in baskets old bags or any thing with which they could most conveniently provide themselves I had not been able since I came here to procure a basket or any thing else to put my corn in and desired the man with whom I lived to take my portion in his basket with that of his family This he readily agreed to do and as soon as we had received our share we left the crib The overseer attended in person to the measuring of this corn and it is only justice to him to say that he was careful to see that justice was done us The men who measured the corn always heaped the measure as long as an ear would lie on and he never restrained their generosity to their fellow- slaves In addition to this allowance of corn we received a weekly allowance of salt amounting in general to about half a gill to each person but this article was not furnished regularly and sometimes we received none for two or three weeks The reader must not suppose that on this plantation we had nothing to eat beyond the corn and salt This was far from the case I have already described the gardens or patches cultivated by the people and the practice which they universally followed of working on Sunday for wages In addition to all these an industrious managing slave would contrive to gather up a great deal to eat I have before observed that the planters are careful of the health of their slaves and in pursuance of this rule they seldom expose them to rainy weather especially in the sickly seasons of the year if it can be avoided In the spring and early parts of the summer the rains are frequently so violent and the ground becomes so wet that it is injurious to the cotton to work it at least whilst it rains In the course of the year there are many of these rainy days in which the people cannot go to work with safety and it often happens that there is nothing for them to do in the house At such time they make baskets brooms horse collars and other things which they are able to sell amongst the planters The baskets are made of wooden splits and the brooms of young white oak or hickory trees The mats are sometimes made of splits but more frequently of flags as they are called--a kind of tall rush which grows in swampy ground The horse or mule collars are made of husks of corn though sometimes of rushes but the latter are not very durable The money procured by these and various other means which I shall explain hereafter is laid out by the slaves in purchasing such little articles of necessity or luxury as it enables the to procure A part is disbursed in payment for sugar molasses and sometimes a few pounds of coffee for the use of the family another part is laid out for clothes for winter and no inconsiderable portion of his pittance is squandered away by the misguided slave for tobacco and an occasional bottle of rum Tobacco is deemed so indispensable to comfort nay to existence that hunger and nakedness are patiently endured to enable the slave to indulge in this highest of enjoyments There being few towns in the cotton country the shops or stores are frequently kept at some cross road or other public place in or adjacent to a rich district of plantations To these shops the slaves resort sometimes with and at other times without the consent of the overseer for the purpose of laying out the little money they get Notwithstanding all the vigilance that is exercised by the planters the slaves who are no less vigilant than their masters often leave the plantation after the overseer has retired to his bed and go to the store The store-keepers are always ready to accommodate the slaves who are frequently better customers than any white people because the former always pay cash whilst the latter almost always require credit In dealing with the slave the shop-keeper knows he can demand whatever price he pleases for his goods without danger of being charged with extortion and he is ready to rise at any time of the night to oblige friends who are of so much value to him It is held highly disgraceful on the part of store-keepers to deal with the slaves for any thing but money or the coarse fabrics that it is known are the usual products of the ingenuity and industry of the negroes but notwithstanding this a considerable traffic is carried on between the shop-keepers and slaves in which the latter make their payments by barter The utmost caution and severity of masters and overseers are sometimes insufficient to repress the cunning contrivances of the slaves After we had received our corn we deposited it in our several houses and immediately followed the overseer to the same cotton field in which we had been at work on Saturday Our breakfast this morning was bread to which was added a large basket of apples from the orchard of our master These apples served us for a relish with our bread both for breakfast and dinner and when I returned to the quarter in the evening Dinah the name of the woman who was at the head of our family produced at supper a black jug containing molasses and gave me some of the molasses for my supper I felt grateful to Dinah for this act of kindness as I well knew that her children regarded molasses as the greatest of human luxuries and that she was depriving them of their highest enjoyment to afford me the means of making a gourd full of molasses and water I therefore proposed to her and her husband whose name was Nero that whilst I should remain a member of the family I would contribute as much towards its support as Nero himself or at least that I would bring all my earnings into the family stock provided I might be treated as one of its members and be allowed a portion of the proceeds of their patch or garden This offer was very readily accepted and from this time we constituted one community as long as I remained among the field hands on this plantation After supper was over we had to grind our corn but as we had to wait for our turn at the mill we did not get through this indispensable operation before one o'clock in the morning We did not sit up all night to wait for our turn at the mill but as our several turns were assigned us by lot the person who had the first turn when done with the with the mill gave notice to the one entitled to the second and so on By this means nobody lost more than half an hour's sleep and in the morning every one's grinding was done We worked very hard this week We were now laying by the cotton as it is termed that is we were giving the last weeding and hilling to the crop of which there was on this plantation about five hundred acres which looked well and promised to yield a fine picking In addition to the cotton there was on this plantation one hundred acres of corn about ten acres of indigo ten or twelve acres in sweet potatoes and a rice swamp of about fifty acres The potatoes and indigo had been laid by at that is the season of working in them was past before I came upon the estate and we were driven hard by the overseer to get done with the cotton to be ready to give the corn another harrowing and hoeing before the season should be too far advanced Most of the corn in this part of the country was already laid by but the crop here had been planted late and yet required to be worked We were supplied with an abundance of bread for a peck of corn is as much as a man call consume in a week if he has other vegetables with it but we were obliged to provide ourselves with the other articles necessary for our subsistence Nero had corn in his patch which was now hard enough to be fit for boiling and my friend Lydia had beans in her garden We exchanged corn for beans and had a good supply of both but these delicacies we were obliged to reserve for supper We took our breakfast in the field from the cart which seldom afforded us any thing better than bread and some raw vegetables from the garden Nothing of moment occurred amongst us in this first week of my residence here On Wednesday evening called settlement-night two men and a woman were whipped but circumstances of this kind were so common that I shall in future not mention them unless something extraordinary attended them I could make wooden bowls and ladles and went to work with a man who was clearing some new land about two miles off--on the second Sunday of my sojourn here and applied the money I earned in purchasing the tools necessary to enable me to carry on my trade I occupied all my leisure hours for several months after this in making wooden trays and such other wooden vessels as were most in demand These I traded off in part to a storekeeper who lived about five miles from the plantation and for some of my work I obtained money before Christmas I had sold more than thirty dollars worth of my manufactures but the merchant with whom I traded charged such high prices for his goods that I was poorly compensated for my Sunday toils and nightly labours nevertheless by these means I was able to keep our family supplied with molasses and some other luxuries and at the approach of winter I purchased three coarse blankets to which Nero added as many and we had all these made up into blanket-coats for Dinah ourselves and the children About ten days after my arrival we had a great feast at the quarter One night after we had returned from the field the overseer sent for me by his little son and when I came to his house he asked me if I understood the trade of a butcher-- told him I was not a butcher by trade but that I had often assisted my master and others to kill hogs and cattle and that I could dress a hog or a bullock as well as most people He then told me he was going to have a beef killed in the morning at the great house and I must do it--that he would not spare any of the hands to go with me but he would get one of the house-boys to help me When the morning came I went according to orders to butcher the beef which I expected to find in some enclosure on the plantation but the overseer told me I must take a boy named Toney from the house whose business it was to take care of the cattle and go to the woods and look for the beef Toney and I set out sometime before sunrise and went to a cow-pen about a mile from the house where he he had seen the young cattle only a day or two before At this cow-pen we saw several cows waiting to be milked I suppose for their calves were in an adjoining field and separated from them only by a fence Toney then we should have to go to the long savanna where the dry cattle generally ranged and thither we set off This long savanna lay at the distance of three miles from the cow-pen and when we reached it I found it to be literally what it was called a long savanna It was a piece of low swampy ground several miles in extent with an open space in the interior part of it about a mile long and perhaps a quarter of a mile in width It was manifest that this open space was covered with water through the greater part of the year which prevented the growth of timber in this place though at the time it was dry except a pond near one end which covered perhaps an acre of ground In this natural meadow every kind of wild grass common to such places in the southern country abounded Here I first saw the scrub and saw grasses--the first of which is so hard and rough that it is gathered to scrub coarse wooden furniture or even pewter and the last is provided with edges somewhat like saw teeth so hard and sharp that it would soon tear the skin off the legs of any one who should venture to walk through it with bare limbs As we entered this savanna we were enveloped in clouds of musquitos and swarm of galinippers that threatened to devour us As we advanced through the grass they rose up until the air was thick and actually darkened with them They rushed upon us with the fury of yellow-jackets whose hive has been broken in upon and covered every part of our persons The clothes I had on which were nothing but a shirt and trousers of tow linen afforded no protection even against the musquitos which were much larger than those found along the Chesapeake Bay and nothing short of a covering of leather could have defended me against the galinippers I was pierced by a thousand stings at a time and verily believe I could not have lived beyond a few hours in this place Toney ran into the pond and rolled himself in the water to get rid of his persecutors but he had not been long there before he came running out as fast as he had gone in hallooing and clamouring in a manner wholly unintelligible to me He was terribly frightened but I could not imagine what could be the cause of his alarm until he reached the shore when he turned round with his face to the water and called out-- the biggest alligator in the whole world--did not you see him I told him I had not seen any thing but himself in the water but he insisted that he had been chased in the pond by an alligator which had followed him until he was close to the shore We waited a few minutes for the alligator to rise to the surface but were soon compelled by the musquitos to quit this place Toney we need not look for the cattle here no cattle could live amongst these musquitos and I thought he was right in his judgment We then proceeded into the woods and thickets and after wandering about for an hour or more we found the cattle and after much difficulty succeeded in driving a part of the back to the cow-pen and enclosing them in it I here selected the one that appeared to me to be the fattest and securing it with ropes we drove the animal to the place of slaughter This beef was intended as a feast for the slaves at the laying by of the corn and cotton and when I had it hung up and had taken the hide off my young master who I had seen on the day of my arrival came out to me and ordered me to cut off the head neck legs and tail and lay them together with the empty stomach and the harslet in a basket This basket was sent home to the kitchen of the great house by a woman and a boy who attended for that purpose I think there was at least one hundred and twenty or thirty pounds of this offal The residue of the carcass I cut into four quarters and we carried it to the cellar of the great house Here one of the hind quarters was salted in a tub for the use of the family and the other was sent as a present to a planter who lived about four miles distant The two fore-quarters were cut into very small pieces and salted by themselves These I was told would be cooked for our dinner on the next day Sunday when there was to be a general rejoicing amongst all the slaves of the plantation After the beef was salted down I received some bread and milk for my breakfast and went to join the hands in the corn field where they were now harrowing and hoeing the crop for the last time The overseer had promised us that we should have holiday after the completion of this work and by great exertion we finished it about five o'clock in the afternoon On our return to the quarter the overseer at roll-call-- which he performed this day before night-- told us that every family must send a bowl to the great house to get our dinners of meat This intelligence diffused as much joy amongst us as if each one had drawn a prize in a lottery At the assurance of a meat dinner the old people smiled and showed their teeth and returned thanks to master overseer but many of the younger ones shouted clapped their hands leaped and ran about with delight Each family or mess now sent its deputy with a large wooden bowl in his hand to receive the dinner at the great kitchen I went on the part of our family and found that the meat dinner of this day was made up of the basket of tripe and other offal that I had prepared in the morning The whole had been boiled in four great iron kettles until the flesh had disappeared from the bones which were broken in small pieces--a flitch of bacon some green corn squashes tomatos and onions had been added together with other condiments and the whole converted into about a hundred gallons of soup of which I received in my bowl for the use of our family more than two gallons We had plenty of bread and a supply of black-eyed peas gathered from our garden some of which Dinah had boiled in our kettle whilst I was gone for the soup of which there was as much as we could consume and I believe that every one in the quarter had enough I doubt if there was in the world a happier assemblage than ours on this Saturday evening We had finished one of the grand divisions of the labours of a cotton plantation and were supplied with a dinner which to the most of my fellow-slaves appeared to be a great luxury and most liberal donation on the part of our master who they regarded with sentiments of gratitude for this manifestation of his bounty In addition to present gratification they looked forward to the enjoyments of the next day when they were to spend a whole Sunday in rest and banqueting for it was known that the two fore-quarters of the bullock were to be dressed for Sunday's dinner and I had told them that each of these quarters weighed at least one hundred pounds Our quarter knew but little quiet this night singing-- playing on the banjoe and dancing occupied nearly the whole community until the break of day Those who were too old to take any part in our active pleasures beat time with their hands or recited stories of former times Most of these stories referred to affairs that had been transacted in Africa and were sufficiently fraught with demons miracles and murders to fix the attention of many hearers To add to our happiness the early peaches were now ripe and the overseer permitted us to send on Sunday morning to the orchard and gather at least ten bushels of very fine fruit In South Carolina they have very good summer apples but they fall from the trees and rot immediately after they are ripe indeed very often they speck-rot on the trees before they become ripe This speck-rot as it is termed appears to be a kind of epidemic disease amongst apples for in some seasons whole orchards are subject to it and the fruit is totally worthless whilst in other years the fruit in the same orchard continues sound and good until it is ripe The climate of Carolina is however not favourable to the apple and this fruit of so much value in the north is in the cotton region only of a few weeks continuance--winter apples being unknown Every climate is congenial to the growth of some kind of fruit tree and in Carolina and Georgia the peach arrives at its utmost perfection the fig also ripens well and is a delicious fruit None of our people went out to work for wages to-day Some few devoted a part of the morning to such work as they deemed necessary in or about their patches and some went to the woods or the swamps to collect sticks for brooms and splits or to gather flags for mats but far the greater number remained at the quarter occupied in some small work or quietly awaiting the hour of dinner which we had been informed by one of the house-servants would be at one o'clock Every family made ready some preparation of vegetables from their own garden to enlarge the quantity if not to heighten the flavour of the dinner of this day One o'clock at length arrived but not before it had been long desired and we proceeded with our bowls a second time to the great kitchen I acted as I had done yesterday the part of commissary for our family but when we were already at the place where we were to receive our soup and meat into our bowls for it was understood that we were with the soup to have an allowance of both beef and bacon to-day we were told that puddings had been boiled for us and that we must bring dishes to receive them in This occasioned some delay until we obtained vessels from the quarter In addition to at least two gallons of soup about a pound of beef and a small piece of bacon I obtained nearly two pounds of pudding made of corn meal mixed with lard and boiled in large bags This pudding with the molasses that we had at home formed a very palatable second course to our bread soup and vegetables On Sunday afternoon we had a meeting at which many of our party attended A man named Jacob who had come from Virginia sang and prayed but a great many of the people went out about the plantation in search of fruits for there were many peach and some fig trees standing along the fences on various parts of the estate With us this was a day of uninterrupted happiness A man cannot well be miserable when he sees every one about him immersed in pleasure and though our fare of to-day was not of a quality to yield me much gratification yet such was the impulse given to my feelings by the universal hilarity and contentment which prevailed amongst my fellows that I forgot for the time all the subjects of grief that were stored in my memory all the acts of wrong that had been perpetrated against me and entered with the most sincere and earnest sentiments in the participation of the felicity of our community XII At the time of which I now speak the rice was ripe and ready to be gathered On Monday morning after our feast the overseer took the whole of us to the rice field to enter upon the harvest of this crop The field lay in a piece of low ground near the river and in such a position that it could be flooded by the water of the stream in wet seasons The rice is planted in drills or rows and grows more like oats than any of the other grain known in the north The water is sometimes let in to the rice fields and drawn off again several times according to the state of the weather Watering and weeding the rice is considered one of the most unhealthy occupations on a southern plantation as the people are obliged to live for several weeks in the mud and water subject to all the unwholesome vapours that arise from stagnant pools under the rays of a summer sun as well as the chilly autumnal dews of night At the time we came to cut this rice the field was quite dry and after we had reaped and bound it we hauled it upon wagons to a piece of hard ground where we made a threshing floor and threshed it In some places they tread out the rice with mules or horses as they tread wheat in Maryland but this renders the grain dusty and is injurious to its sale After getting in the rice we were occupied for some time in clearing and ditching swampy land preparatory to a more extended culture of rice the next year and about the first of August twenty or thirty of the people principally women and children were employed for two weeks in making cider of apples which grew in an orchard of nearly two hundred trees that stood on a part of the estate After the cider was made a barrel of it was one day brought to the field and distributed amongst us but this gratuity was not repeated The cider that was made by the people was converted into brandy at a still in the corner of the orchard I often obtained cider to drink at the still which was sheltered from the weather by a shed of boards and slabs We were not permitted to go into the orchard at pleasure but as long as the apples continued we were allowed the privilege of sending five or six persons every evening for the purpose of bringing apples to the quarter for our common use and by taking large baskets and filling them well we generally contrived to get as many as we could consume When the peaches ripened they were guarded with more rigour--peach brandy being an article which is nowhere more highly prized than in South Carolina There were on the plantation more than a thousand peach trees growing on poor sandy fields which were no longer worth the expense of cultivation The best peaches grow upon the poorest sandhills We were allowed to take three bushels of peaches every day for the use of the quarter but we could and did eat at least three times that quantity for we stole at night that which was not given us by day I confess that I took part in these thefts and I do not feel that I committed any wrong against either God or man by my participation in the common danger that we ran for we well knew the consequences that would have followed detection After the feast at laying by the corn and cotton we had no meat for several weeks and it is my opinion that our master lost money by the economy he practised at this season of the year In the month of August we had to save the fodder This fodder-saving is the most toilsome and next to working in the rice swaps the most unhealthy job that has to be performed on a cotton plantation in the whole year The manner of doing it is to cut the tops from the corn as is done in Pennsylvania but in addition to this the blades below the ear are always pulled off by the hand Great pains is taken with these corn-blades They constitute the chosen food of race and all other horses that are intended to be kept with extraordinary care and in superior condition For the purpose of procuring the best blades they are frequently stripped from the stock sometimes before the corn is ripe enough in the ear to permit the top of the stalk to be cut off without prejudice to the grain After the blades are stripped from the stem they are stuck between the hills of corn until they are cured ready for the stack They are then cut and bound in sheaves with small bands of the blades themselves This binding and the subsequent hauling from the field must be done either early in the morning before the dew is dried up or in the night whilst the dew is falling This work exposes the people who do it to the fogs and damps of the climate at the most unhealthy season of the year Agues fevers and all the diseases which follow in their train have their dates at the time of fodder-saving It is the only work appertaining to a cotton estate which must of necessity be done in the night or in the fogs of the morning and the people at this season of the year and whilst engaged in this very fatiguing work would certainly be better able to go through with it if they were regularly supplied with proper portions of sound and wholesome salted provisions If every master would through the months of August and September supply his people with only a quarter of a pound of good bacon flitch to each person daily I have no doubt but that he would save money by it to say nothing of the great comfort it would yield to the slaves at this period when the human frame is so subject to debility and feebleness Early in August disease made its appearance amongst us Several were attacked by the ague with its accompanying fever but in South Carolina the ague as it is called is scarcely regarded as a disease and if a slave has no ailment that is deemed more dangerous he is never withdrawn from the roll of the field hands I have seen many of our poor people compelled to pick cotton when their frames were shaken so violently by the ague that they were unable to get hold of the cotton in the burs without difficulty In this masters commit a great error Many fine slaves are lost by this disease which superinduces the dropsy and sometimes the consumption which could have been prevented by arresting the ague at its onset When any of our people were taken so ill that they were not able to go to the field they were removed to the great house and placed in the sick room as it was termed This sick room was a large airy apartment in the second story of a building which stood in the garden The lower part of this building was divided into two apartments in one of which was kept the milk butter and other things connected with the dairy In the other the salt provisions of the family including fish bacon and other articles were secured This apartment also constituted the smoke house but as the ceiling was lathed and plastered with a thick coat of lime and sand no smoke could penetrate the sick room which was at all seasons of the year a very comfortable place to sleep in Though I was never sick myself whilst on this plantation I was several times in this sick room and always observed when there that the sick slaves were well attended to There a hanging partition which could be let down at pleasure and which was let down when it was necessary to divide the rooms into two apartments which always happened when there were several slaves of different sexes sick at the same time The beds upon which the sick lay were of straw but clean and wholesome and the patients when once in this room were provided with every thing necessary for persons in their situation A physician attended them daily and proper food and even wines were not wanting The contrast between the cotton and rice fields and this little hospital was very great and it appeared to me at the time that if a part of the tenderness and benevolence displayed here had been bestowed upon the people whilst in good health very many of the inmates of this infirmary would never have been here I have often seen the same misapplication of the principles of philanthropy in Pennsylvania--the subjects only being varied from slaves to horses The finest and most valuable horses are often overworked or driven beyond their capacity of endurance it cannot be that horses are not generally well fed in Pennsylvania without mercy or consideration on the part of their owners or more frequently of unfeeling hirelings who have no interest in the life of the poor animal and when his constitution is broken and his health gone great care and even expense are bestowed upon him for the purpose of restoring him to his former strength the one half of which care or expense would have preserved him in beauty and vigour had they been bestowed upon him before he had suffered the irreparable injuries attendant upon his cruel treatment In Pennsylvania the horse is regarded and justly regarded only on account of the labour he is able to perform Being the subject of property his owner considers not how he shall add most to the comforts and enjoyments of his horse but by what means he shall be able to procure the greatest amount of labour from him with the least expense to himself In devising the means of saving expense the life of the horse and the surest and cheapest method of its preservation are taken into consideration Precisely in this way do the cotton planters reason and act in relation to their slaves Regarding the negroes merely as objects of property like prudent calculators they study how to render this property of the greatest value and to obtain the greatest yearly income from the capital invested in the slaves and the lands they cultivate Experience has proved to me that a man who eats no animal food may yet be healthy and able to perform the work usually done on a cotton plantation Corn bread sweet potatoes some garden vegetables with a little molasses and salt assisted by the other accidental supplies that a thrifty slave is able to procure on a plantation are capable of sustaining life and health and a slave who lives on such food and never tastes flesh stands at least an equal chance for long life with his master or mistress who are clad in purple and fine linen and fare sumptuously every day More people are killed by eating and drinking too much than die of the effects of starvation in the south but the diseases of the white man do not diminish the sufferings of the black one A man who lives upon vegetable diet may be healthy and active but I know he is not so strong and vigorous as if he enjoyed a portion of animal food The labour usually performed by slaves on a cotton plantation does not require great bodily strength but rather superior agility and wakefulness The hoes in use are not heavy and the art of picking cotton depends not upon superior strength but upon the power of giving quick and accelerated motion to the fingers arms and legs The fences have to be made and repaired and ditches dug--wood must also be cut for many purposes and all these operations call for strength but they consume only a very small portion of the whole year--more than three fourths of which is spent in the cotton corn rice and indigo fields where the strength of a boy or a woman is sufficient to perform any kind of labour necessary in the culture of the plants but men are able to do more even of this work than either boys or women We scarcely had time to complete the securing of the fodder and working up the apples and peaches when the cotton was ready for picking This business of picking cotton constitutes about half the labour of the year on a large plantation In Carolina it is generally commenced about the first of September though in some years much cotton is picked in August The manner of doing the work is this The cotton being planted in hills in straight rows from four to five feet apart each hand or picker provided with a bag made of cotton bagging holding a bushel or more hung round the neck with cords proceeds from one side of the field to the other between two of these rows picking all the cotton from the open burs on the right and left as he goes It is the business of the picker to take all the cotton from each of the rows as far as the lines of the rows or hills In this way he picks half the cotton from each of the rows and the pickers who come on his right and left take the remainder from the opposite sides of the rows The cotton is gathered into the bag and when it becomes burdensome by its weight it is deposited in some convenient place until night when it is taken home either in a large bag or basket and weighed under the inspection of the overseer A day's work is not estimated by the number of hills or rows that are picked in the day but by the number of pounds of cotton in the seed that the picker brings into the cotton house at night In a good field of cotton fully ripe a day's work is sixty pounds but where the cotton is of inferior quality or the burs are not in full blow fifty pounds is the day's work and where the cotton is poor or in bad order forty or even thirty pounds is as much as one hand can get in a day The picking of cotton continues from August until December or January and in some fields they pick from the old plants until they are ploughed up in February or March to make room for the planting of the seeds of another crop On all estates the standard of a day's work is fixed by the overseer according to the quality of the cotton and if a hand gathers more than this standard he is paid for it but if on the other hand when his or her cotton is weighed at the cotton-house in the evening it is found that the standard quantity has not been picked the delinquent picker is sure to receive a whipping On some estates settlements are made every evening and the whipping follows immediately on others the whipping does not occur until the next morning whilst on a few plantations the accounts are closed twice or three times a week I have stated heretofore that our overseer whipped twice a week for the purpose of saving time but if this method saved time to the overseer and the hands it also saved the latter of a great many hard stripes for very often when one of us had displeased the overseer he would tell us that on Wednesday or Saturday night as the case might be we should be remembered yet the matter was either forgotten or the passion of the overseer subdued before the time of retribution arrived and the delinquent escaped altogether from the punishment which would certainly have fallen upon him if it had been the custom of the overseer to chastise for every offence at the moment or even on the day of its perpetration A short day's work was always punished The cotton does not all ripen at the same time on the same plant which is picked and repicked from six to ten times The burs ripen and burst open on the lower branches of the plant whilst those at the top are yet in flower or perhaps only in leaf or bud The plant grows on taller and larger until it is arrested by the frost or cool weather in autumn continually throwing out new branches new stems new blossoms and new burs ceasing only with the first frost at which time there are always some green burs at the top of the plant that never arrive at maturity This state of things is however often prevented by topping the plant in August or September which prevents it from throwing out new branches and blossoms and forwards the growth and ripening of those already formed The first picking takes the cotton from the burs of the lowest branches the second from those a little higher and so on until those of the latest growth at the top of the plant are reached When the season has been bad or from any other cause the crop is light the picking is sometimes complete and the field clear of the cotton before the first of January but when the crop is heavy or the people have been sickly in the fall the picking is frequently protracted until February or even the first of March The winter does not injure the cotton standing in the field though the wind blows some of it out of the expanded burs which is thus scattered over the field and lost An acre of prime land will yield two thousand pounds of cotton in the seed I have heard of three thousand pounds having been picked from an acre but have not seen it Four pounds of cotton in the seed yields one pound when cleaned and prepared for market It is estimated by the planters or rather by the overseers that a good hand can cultivate and pick five acres of cotton and raise as much corn as will make his bread and feed a mule or a horse I know this to be a very hard task for a single hand if the land is good and the crops at all luxuriant One man may with great diligence and continued good health be able to get through with the cotton and two or three or even five acres of corn up to the time when the cotton is ready to be picked but from this period he will find the labour more than he can perform if the cotton is to be picked clean from the plants Five acres of good cotton will yield ten thousand pounds of rough or seed cotton If he can pick sixty pounds a day and works twenty-five days in a month the picking of ten thousand pounds will occupy him more than six months From my own observations on the plantations of South Carolina and Georgia I am of opinion that the planters in those states do not get more than six or seven thousand pounds of cotton in the seed for each hand employed and I presume that fifteen hundred pounds of clean cotton is a full average of the product of the labour of each hand I now entered upon a new scene of life My true value had not yet been ascertained by my present owner and whether I was to hold the rank of a first or second rate hand could only be determined by an experience of my ability to pick cotton nor was this important trait in my character to be fully understood by a trial of one or only a few days It requires some time to enable a stranger or new hand to acquire the sleight of picking cotton I had ascertained that at the hoe the spade the axe the sickle or the flan I was a full match for the best hands on the plantation but soon discovered when we came to the picking of cotton that I was not equal to a boy of twelve or fifteen years of age I worked hard the first day and made every effort to sustain the character that I had acquired amongst my companions but when evening came and our cotton was weighed I had only thirty-eight pounds and was vexed to see that two younger men about my own age had one fifty-eight and the other fifty-nine pounds This was our first day's work and the overseer had not yet settled the amount of a day's picking It was necessary for him to ascertain by the experience of a few days how much the best hands could pick in a day before he established the standard of the season I hung down my head and felt very much ashamed of myself when I found that my cotton was so far behind that of many even of the women who had heretofore regarded me as the strongest and most powerful man of the whole gang I had exerted myself to-day to the utmost of my power and as the picking of cotton seemed to be so very simple a business I felt apprehensive that I should never be able to improve myself so far as to become even a second rate hand In this posture of affairs I looked forward to something still more painful than loss of character which I must sustain both with my fellows and my master for I knew that the lash of the overseer would soon become familiar with my back if I did not perform as much work as any of the other young men I expected indeed that it would go hard with me even now and stood by with feelings of despondence and terror whilst the other people were getting their cotton weighed When it was all weighed the overseer came to me where I stood and told me to show him my hands When I had done this and he had looked at them he observed--You have a pair of good hands--you will make a good picker This faint praise of the overseer revived my spirits greatly and I went home with a lighter heart than I had expected to possess before the termination of cotton-picking When I came to get my cotton weighed on the evening of the second day I was rejoiced to find that I had forty-six pounds although I had not worked harder than I did the first day On the third evening I had fifty-two pounds and before the end of the week there were only three hands in the field--two men and a young woman--who could pick more cotton in a day than I could On the Monday morning of the second week when we went to the field the overseer told us that he fixed the days work at fifty pounds and that all those who picked more than that would be paid a cent a pound for the overplus Twenty-five pounds was assigned as the daily task of the old people as well as a number of boys and girls whilst some of the women who had children were required to pick forty pounds and several children had ten pounds each as their task Picking of cotton may almost be reckoned among the arts A man who has arrived at the age of twenty-five before he sees a cotton field will never in the language of the overseer become a crack picker By great industry and vigilance I was able at the end of a month to return every evening a few pounds over the daily rate for which I received my pay but the business of picking cotton was an irksome and fatiguing labour to me and one to which I could never become thoroughly reconciled for the reason I believe that in every other kind of work in which I was engaged in the south I was able to acquire the character of a first rate hand whilst in picking cotton I was hardly regarded as a prime hand XIII In a community of near three hundred persons governed by laws as severe and unbending as which regulated our actions it is not to be expected that universal content can prevail or that crimes will not be imagined and even sometimes perpetrated Ignorant men estimate those things which fortune has placed beyond their reach not by their real value but by the strength of their own desires and passions Objects in themselves indifferent which they are forbidden to touch or even approach excite in the minds of the unreflecting ungovernable impulses The slave who is taught from infancy to regard his condition as unchangeable and his fate as fixed by the laws of nature fancies that he sees his master in possession of that happiness which he knows has been denied to himself The lower men are sunk in the scale of civilization the more violent become their animal passions The native Africans are revengeful and unforgiving in their tempers easily provoked and cruel in their designs They generally place little or even no value upon fine houses and superb furniture of their masters and discover no beauty in the fair complexions and delicate forms of their mistresses They feel indignant at the servitude that is imposed upon them and only want power to inflict the most cruel retribution upon their oppressors but they desire only the means of subsistence and temporary gratification in this country during their abode here They are universally of opinion and this opinion is founded in their religion that after death they shall return to their own country and rejoin their former companions and friends in some happy region in which they will be provided with plenty of food and beautiful women from the lovely daughters of their own native land The case is different with the American negro who knows nothing of Africa her religion or customs and who has borrowed all his ideas of present and future happiness from the opinions and intercourse of white people and of Christians He is perhaps not so impatient of slavery and excessive labour as the native of Congo but his mind is bent upon other pursuits and his discontent works out for itself other schemes than those which agitate the brain of the imported negro His heart pants for no heaven beyond the waves of the ocean and he dreams of no delights in the arms of sable beauties in groves of immortality on the banks of the Niger or the Gambia nor does he often solace himself with the reflection that the clay wilt arrive when all men will receive the awards of immutable justice and live together in eternal bliss without any other distinctions than those of superior virtue and exalted mercy Circumstances oppose great obstacles in the way of these opinions The slaves who are natives of the country I now speak of the mass of those on the cotton plantations as I knew them like all other people who suffer wrong in this world are exceedingly prone to console themselves with the delights of a future state when the evil that has been endured in this life will not only be abolished and all injuries be compensated by proper rewards bestowed upon the sufferers but as they have learned that wickedness is to be punished as well as goodness compensated they do not stop at the point of their own enjoyments and pleasures but believe that those who have tormented them here will most surely be tormented in their turn hereafter The gross and carnal minds of these slaves are not capable of arriving at the sublime doctrines taught by the white preachers in which they are encouraged to look forward to the day when all distinctions of colour and of condition will be abolished and they shall sit down in the same paradise with their masters mistresses and even with the overseer They are ready enough to receive the faith which conducts them to heaven and eternal rest on account of their present sufferings but they by no means so willingly admit the master and mistress to an equal participation in their enjoyments-- this would only be partial justice and half way retribution According to their notions the master and mistress are to be in future the companions of wicked slaves whilst an agreeable recreation of the celestial inhabitants of the negro's heaven will be a return to the overseer of the countless lashes that he has lent out so liberally here It is impossible to reconcile the mind of the native slave to the idea of living in a state of perfect equality and boundless affection with the white people Heaven will be no heaven to him if he is not to be avenged of his enemies I know from experience that these are the fundamental rules of his religious creed because I learned them in the religious meetings of the slaves themselves A favourite and kind master or mistress may now and then be admitted into heaven but this rather as a matter of favour to the intercession of some slave than as matter of strict justice to the whites who will by no means be of an equal rank with those who shall be raised from the depths of misery in this world The idea of a revolution in the conditions of the whites and the blacks is the corner-stone of the religion of the latter and indeed it seems to me at least to be quite natural if not in strict accordance with the precepts of the Bible for in that book I find it every where laid down that those who have possessed an inordinate portion of the good things of this world and have lived in ease and luxury at the expense of their fellow men will surely have to render an account of their stewardship and be punished for having withheld from others the participation of those blessings which they themselves enjoyed There is no subject which presents the mind of the male slave a greater contrast between his own condition and that of his master than the relative station and appearance of his wife and his mistress The one poorly clad poorly fed and exposed to all the hardships of the cotton field the other dressed in clothes of gay and various colours ornamented with jewelry and carefully protected from the rays of the sun and the blasts of the wind As I have before observed the Africans have feelings peculiar to themselves but with an American slave the possession of the spacious house splendid furniture and fine horses of his master are but the secondary objects of his desires To fill the measure of his happiness and crown his highest ambition his young and beautiful mistress must adorn his triumph and enliven his hopes I have been drawn into the above reflections by the recollection of an event of a most melancholy character which took place when I had been on this plantation about three months Amongst the house-servants of my master was a young man named Hardy of a dark yellow complexion--a quadroon or mulatto--one fourth of whose blood was transmitted from white parentage Hardy was employed in various kinds of work about the house and was frequently sent of errands sometimes on horseback I had become acquainted with the boy who had often come to see me at the quarter and had sometimes staid all night with me and often told me of the ladies and gentlemen who visited at the great house Amongst others he frequently spoke of a young lady who resided six or seven miles from the plantation and often came to visit the daughters of the family in company with her brother a lad about twelve or fourteen years of age He described the great beauty of this girl whose mother was a widow living on a small estate of her own This lady did not keep a carriage but her son and daughter when they went abroad travelled on horseback One Sunday these two young people came to visit at the house of my master and remained until after tea in the evening As I did not go out to work that day I went over to the great house and from the house to a place in the woods about a mile distant where I had set snares for rabbits This place was near the road and I saw the young lady and her brother on their way home It was after sundown when they passed me but as the evening was clear and pleasant I supposed they would get home soon after dark and that no accident would befall them No more was thought of the matter this evening and I heard nothing further of the young people until the next day about noon when a black boy came into the field where we were picking cotton and went to the overseer with a piece of paper In a short time the overseer called me to come with him and leaving the field with the hands under the orders of Simon the first captain we proceeded to the great house As soon as we arrived at the mansion my master who had not spoken to me since the day we came from Columbia appeared at the front door and ordered me to come in and follow him He led me through a part of the house and passed into the back yard where I saw the young gentleman his son another gentleman whom I did not know the family doctor and the overseer all standing together and in earnest conversation At my appearance the overseer opened a cellar door and ordered me to go in I had no suspicion of evil and obeyed the order immediately as indeed I must have obeyed it whatever might have been my suspicions The overseer and the gentlemen all followed and as soon as the cellar door was closed after us by some one whom I could not see I was ordered to pull off my clothes and lie down on my back I was then bound by the hands and feet with strong cords and extended at full length between two of the beams that supported the timbers of the building The stranger who I now observed was much agitated spoke to the doctor who then opened a small case of surgeons' instruments which he took from his pocket and told me he was going to skin me for what I had done last night But the doctor before you are skinned you had better confess your crime What crime master shall I confess I have committed no crime--what has been done that you are going to murder me was my reply My master then asked me why I had followed the young lady and her brother who went from the house the evening before and murdered her Astonished and terrified at the charge of being a murderer I knew not what to say and only continued the protestations of my innocence and my entreaties not to be put to death My young master was greatly enraged against me and loaded me with maledictions and imprecations and his father appeared to be as well satisfied as he was of my guilt but was more calm and less vociferous in his language The doctor during this time was assorting his instruments and looking at me--then stooping down and feeling my pulse he it would not do to skin a man so full of blood as I was I should bleed so much that he could not see to do his work and he should probably cut some large vein or artery by which I should bleed to death in a few minutes it was necessary to bleed me in the arms for some time so as to reduce the quantity of blood that was in me before taking my skin off He then bound a string round my right arm and opened a vein near the middle of the arm from which the blood ran in a large and smooth stream I already began to feel faint with the loss of blood when the cellar door was thrown open and several persons came down with two lighted candles I looked at these people attentively as they came near and stood around me and expressed their satisfaction at the just and dreadful punishment that I was about to undergo Their faces were all new and unknown to me except that of a lad whom I recognized as the same who had ridden by me the preceding evening in company with his sister My old master spoke to this boy by name and told him to come and see the murderer of his sister receive his due The boy was a pretty youth and wore his hair long on the top of his head in the fashion of that day As he came round near my head the light of a candle which the doctor held in his hand shone full in my face and seeing that the eyes of the boy met mine I determined to make one more effort to save my life and to him in as calm a tone as I could Young master did I murder young mistress your sister The youth immediately looked at my master and This is not the man--this man has short wool and he had long wool like your Hardy My life was saved I was snatched from the most horrible of tortures and from a slow and painful death I was unbound the bleeding of my arm stopped and I was suffered to put on my clothes and go up into the back yard of the house where I was required to tell what I knew of the young lady and her brother on the previous day I stated that I had seen them in the court yard of the house at the time I was in the kitchen that I had then gone to the woods to set my snares and had seen them pass along the road near me and that this was all the knowledge I had of them The boy was then required to examine me particularly and ascertain whether I was or was not the man who had murdered his sister He he had not seen me at the place where I stated I was and that he was confident I was not the person who had attacked him and his sister That my hair or wool as he called it was short but that of the man who committed the crime was long like Hardy's and that he was about the size of Hardy--not so large as I was but black like me and not yellow like Hardy Some one now asked where Hardy was and he was called for but could not be found in the kitchen Persons were sent to the quarter and other places in quest of him but returned without him Hardy was nowhere to be found Whilst this inquiry or rather search was going on perceiving that my old master had ceased to look upon me as a murderer I asked him to please to tell me what had happened that had been so near proving fatal to me I was now informed that the young lady who had left the house on the previous evening in company with her brother had been assailed on the road about four miles off by a black man who had sprung from a thicket and snatched her horse as she was riding at a short distance behind her brother That the assassin as soon as she was on the ground struck her horse a blow with a long stick which together with the fright caused by the screams of its rider when torn from it had caused it to fly off at full speed and the horse of the brother also taking fright followed in pursuit notwithstanding all the exertions of the lad to stop it All the account the brother could give of the matter was that as his horse ran with him he saw the negro drag his sister into the woods and heard her screams for a short time He was not able to stop his horse until he reached home when he gave information to his mother and her family That people had been scouring the woods all night and all the morning without being able to find the young lady When intelligence of this horrid crime was brought to the house of my master Hardy was the first to receive it he having gone to take the horse of the person--a young gentleman of the neighbourhood-- who bore it and who immediately returned to join his friends in their search for the dead body As soon as the messenger was gone Hardy had come to my master and told him that if he would prevent me from murdering him he would disclose the perpetrator of the crime He was then ordered to communicate all he knew on the subject and declared that having gone into the woods the day before to hunt squirrels he staid until it was late and on his return home hearing the shrieks of a woman he had proceeded cautiously to the place but before he could arrive at the spot the cries had ceased nevertheless he had found me after some search with the body of the young lady whom I had just killed and that I was about to kill him too with a hickory club but he had saved his life by promising that he would never betray me He was glad to leave me and what I had done with the body he did not know Hardy was known in the neighbourhood and his character had been good I was a stranger and on inquiry the black people in the kitchen supported Hardy by saying that I had been seen going to the woods before night by the way of the road which the deceased had travelled These circumstances were deemed conclusive against me by my master and as the offence of which I was believed to be guilty was the highest that can be committed by a slave according to the opinion of owners it was determined to punish me in a way unknown to the law and to inflict tortures upon me which the law would not tolerate I was now released and though very weak from the effects of bleeding I was yet able to return to my own lodgings I had no doubt that Hardy was the perpetrator of the crime for which I was so near losing my life and now recollected that when I was at the kitchen of the great house on Sunday he had disappeared a short time before sundown as I had looked for him when I was going to set my snares but could not find him I went back to the house and communicated this fact to my master By this time nearly twenty white men had collected about the dwelling with the intention of going to search for the body of the lost lady but it was now resolved to make the look-out double and to give it the twofold character of a pursuit of the living as well as a seeking for the dead I now returned to my lodgings in the quarter and soon fell into a profound sleep from which I did not awake until long after night when all was quiet and the stillness of undisturbed tranquillity prevailed over our little community I felt restless and sunk into a labyrinth of painful reflections upon the horrid and perilous condition from which I had this day escaped as it seemed merely by chance and as I slept until all sensations of drowsiness had left me I rose from my bed and walked out by the light of the moon which was now shining After being in the open air some time I thought of the snares that I had set on Sunday evening and determined to go and see if they had taken any game I sometimes caught oppossums in my snares and as these animals were very fat at this season of the year I felt a hope that I might be fortunate enough to get one tonight I had been at my snares and had returned as far as the road near where I had seen the young lady and her brother on horseback on Sunday evening and had seated myself under the boughs of a holly bush that grew there It so happened that the place where I sat was in the shade of the bush within a few feet of the road but screened from it by some small boughs In this position which I had taken by accident I could see a great distance along the road towards the end of my master's lane Though covered as I was by the shade and enveloped in boughs it was difficult for a person in the road to see me The occurrence that had befallen me in the course of the previous day had rendered me nervous and easily susceptible of all the emotions of fear I had not been long in this place when I thought I heard sounds as of a person walking on the ground at a quick pace and looking along the road towards the lane I saw the form of some one passing through a space in the road where the beams of the moon piercing between two trees reached the ground When the moving body passed into the shade I could not see it but in a short time it came so near that I could distinctly see that it was a man approaching me by the road When he came opposite me and the moon shone full in his face I knew him to be a young mulatto named David the coachman of a widow lady who resided somewhere near Charleston but who had been at the house of my master for two or three weeks as a visiter with her two daughters This man passed on at a quick step without observing me and the suspicion instantly riveted itself in my mind that he was the murderer for whose crime I had already suffered so much and that he was now on his way to the place where he had left the body for the purpose of removing or burying it in the earth I was confident that no honest purpose could bring him to this place at this time of night alone I was about two miles from home and an equal distance from the spot where the girl had been seized Of her subsequent murder no one entertained a doubt for it was not to be expected that the fellow who had been guilty of one great crime would flinch from the commission of another of equal magnitude and suffer his victim to exist as a witness to identify his person I felt animated by a spirit of revenge against the wretch whoever he might be who had brought me so near to torture and death and feeble and weak as I was resolved to pursue the foot-steps of this coachman at a wary and cautious distance and ascertain if possible the object of his visit to these woods at this time of night I waited until he had passed me more than a hundred yards and until I could barely discover his form in the faint light of the deep shade of the trees when stealing quietly into the road I followed with the caution of a spy traversing the camp of an enemy We were now in a dark pine forest and on both sides of us were tracts of low swampy ground covered with thickets so dense as to be difficult of penetration even by a person on foot The road led along a neck of elevated and dry ground that divided these swamps for more than a mile when they terminated and were succeeded by ground that produced scarcely any other timber than a scrubby kind of oak called black jack It was amongst these black jacks about half a mile beyond the swamps that the lady had been carried off I had often been here for the purpose of snaring and trapping the small game of these woods and was well acquainted with the topography of this forest for some distance on both sides of the road It was necessary for me to use the utmost caution in the enterprise I was now engaged in The road we were now travelling was in no place very broad and at some points barely wide enough to permit a carriage to pass between the trees that lined its sides In some places it was so dark that I could not see the man whose steps I followed but was obliged to depend on the sound produced by the tread of his feet upon the ground I deemed it necessary to keep as close as possible to the object of my pursuit lest he should suddenly turn into the swamp on one side or the other of the road and elude my vigilance for I had no doubt that he would quit the road somewhere As we approached the termination of the low grounds my anxiety became intense lest he should escape me and at one time I could not have been more than one hundred feet behind him but he continued his course until he reached the oak woods and came to a place where an old cart-road led off to the left along the side of the Dark Swamp as it was termed in the neighbourhood This road the mulatto took without turning to look behind him Here my difficulties and perils increased for I now felt myself in danger as I had no longer any doubt that I was on the trail of the murderer and that if discovered by him my life would be the price of my curiosity I was too weak to be able to struggle with him for a minute though if the blood which I had lost through his wickedness could have been restored to my veins I could have seized him by the neck and strangled him The road I now had to travel was so little frequented that bushes of the ground oak and bilberry stood thick in almost every part of it Many of these bushes were full of dry leaves which had been touched by the frost but had not yet fallen It was easy for me to follow him for I pursued by the noise he made amongst these bushes but it was not so easy for me to avoid on my part the making of a rustling and agitation of the bushes which might expose me to detection I was now obliged to depend wholly on my ears to guide my pursuit my eyes being occupied in watching my own way to enable me to avoid every object the touching of which was likely to produce sound I followed this road more than a mile led by cracking of the sticks or the shaking of the leaves At length I heard a loud shrill whistle and then a total silence succeeded I now stood still and in a few seconds heard a noise in the swamp like the drumming of a pheasant Soon afterwards I heard the breaking of sticks and the sounds caused by the bending of branches of trees In a little time I was satisfied that something having life was moving in the swamp and coming towards the place where the mulatto stood This was at the end of the cart-road and opposite some large pine trees which grew in the swamp at the distance of two or three hundred yards from its margin The noise in the swamp still approached us and at length a person came out of the thicket and stood for a minute or more with the mulatto whom I had followed and then they both entered the swamp and took the course of the pine trees as I could easily distinguish by my ears When they were gone I advanced to the end of the road and sat down upon a log to listen to their progress through the swamp At length it seemed that they had stopped for I no longer heard any thing of them Anxious however to ascertain more of this mysterious business I remained in silence on the log determined to stay there until day if I could not sooner learn something to satisfy me why these men had gone into the swamp All uncertainty upon this subject was however quickly removed from my mind for within less than ten minutes after I had ceased to hear them moving in the thicket I was shocked by the faint but shrill wailings of a female voice accompanied with exclamations and supplications in a tone so feeble that I could only distinguish a few solitary words My mind comprehended the whole ground of this matter at a glance The lady supposed to have been murdered on Sunday evening was still living and concealed by the two fiends who had passed out of my sight but a few minutes before The one I knew for I had examined his features within a few feet of me in the full light of the moon and that the other was Hardy I was as perfectly convinced as if I had seen him also I now rose to return home the cries of the female in the swamp still continuing but growing weaker and dying away as I receded from the place where I had sat I was now in possession of the clearest evidence of the guilt of the two murderers but I was afraid to communicate my knowledge to my master lest he should suspect me of being an accomplice in this crime and if the lady could not be recovered alive I had no doubt that Hardy and his companion were sufficiently depraved to charge me as a participator with themselves to be avenged upon me I was confident that the mulatto David would return to the house before day and be found in his bed in the morning which he could easily do for he slept in a part of the stable loft under pretence of being near the horses of his mistress I thought it possible that Hardy might also return home that night and endeavour to account for his absence from home on Monday afternoon by some ingenious lie in the invention of which I knew him to be very expert In this case I saw that I should have to run the risk of being overpowered by the number of my false accusers and as I stood alone they might yet be able to sacrifice my life and escape the punishment due to their crimes After much consideration I came to the resolution of returning as quick as possible to the quarter-- calling up the overseer--and acquainting him with all that I had seen heard and done in the course of this night As I did not know what time of night it was when I left my bed I was apprehensive that day might break before I could so far mature my plans as to have persons to way-lay and arrest the mulatto on his return home but when I roused the overseer he told me it was only one o'clock and seemed but little inclined to credit my story but after talking to me several minutes he told me he now more than ever suspected me to be the murderer but he would go with me and see if I had told the truth When we arrived at the great house some members of the family had not yet gone to bed having been kept up by the arrival of several gentlemen who had been searching the woods all day for the lost lady and who had come here to seek lodgings when it was near midnight My master was in bed but was called up and listened attentively to my story--at the close of which he shook his head and with an oath You-- I believe you to be the murderer but we will go and see if all you say is a lie if it is the torments of--will be pleasure to what awaits you You have escaped once but you will not get off a second time I now found that somebody must die and if the guilty could not be found the innocent would have to atone for them The manner in which my master had delivered his words assured me that the life of somebody must be taken This new danger aroused my energies--and I told them I was ready to go and take the consequences Accordingly the overseer my young master and three other gentlemen immediately set out with me It was agreed that we should all travel on foot the overseer and I going a few paces in advance of the others We proceeded silently but rapidly on our way and as we passed it I shewed them the place where I sat under the holly bush the mulatto passed me We neither saw nor heard any person on the road and reached the log at the end of the cart-road where I sat when I heard the cries in the swamp All was now quiet and our party lay down in the bushes on each side of a large gum tree at the root of which the two murderers stood when they talked together before they entered the thicket We had not been here more than an hour when I heard as I lay with my head near the ground a noise in the swamp which I believed could only be made by those whom we sought I however nothing and the gentlemen did not hear it It was caused as I afterwards ascertained by dragging the fallen branch of a tree along the ground for the purpose of lighting the fire The night was very clear and serene--its silence only being broken at intervals by the loud hooting of the great long-eared owls which are numerous in these swamps I felt oppressed by the cold and was glad to hear the crowing of a cock at a great distance announcing the approach of day This was followed after a short interval by the cracking of sticks and by other tokens which I knew could proceed only from the motions of living bodies I now whispered to the overseer who lay near me that it would soon appear whether I had spoken the truth or not All were now satisfied that people were coming out of the swamp for we heard them speak to each other I desired the overseer to advise the other gentlemen to let the culprits come out of the swamp and gain the high ground before we attempted to seize them but this counsel was unfortunately not taken and when they came near to the gum-tree and it could be clearly seen that there were two men and no more one of the gentlemen called out to them to stop or they were dead Instead however of stopping they both sprang forward and took to flight They did not turn into the swamp for the gentleman who ordered them to stop was in their rear--they having already passed him At the moment they had started to run each of the gentlemen fired two pistols at them The pistols made the forest ring on all sides and I supposed it was impossible for either of the fugitives to escape from so many balls This was however not the case for only one of them was injured The mulatto David had one arm and one leg broken and fell about ten yards from us but Hardy escaped and when the smoke cleared away he was nowhere to be seen On being interrogated David acknowledged that the lady was in the swamp on a small island and was yet alive--that he and Hardy had gone from the house on Sunday for the purpose of waylaying and carrying her off and intended to kill her little brother--this part of the duty being assigned to him whilst Hardy was to drag the sister from her horse As they were both mulattos they blacked their faces with charcoal taken from a pine stump partially burned The boy was riding before his sister and when Hardy seized her and dragged her from her horse she screamed and frightened both the horses which took off at full speed by which means the boy escaped Finding that the boy was out of his reach David remained in the bushes until Hardy brought the sister to him They immediately tied a handkerchief round her face so as to cover her mouth and stifle her shrieks and taking her in their arms carried her back toward my master's house for some distance through the woods until they came to the cart-road leading along the swamp They then followed this road as far as it led and turning into the swamp took their victim to a place they had prepared for her the Sunday before on a small knoll in the swamp where the ground was dry Her hands were closely confined and she was tied by the feet to a tree He he had stolen some bread and taken it to her this night but when they unbound her mouth to permit her to eat she only wept and made a noise begging them to release her until they were obliged again to bandage her mouth It was now determined by the gentlemen that as the lady was still alive we ought not to lose a moment in endeavouring to rescue her from her dreadful situation I pointed out the large pine trees in the direction of which I heard the cries of the young lady and near which I believed she was--undertaking at the same time to act as pilot in penetrating the thicket Three of the gentlemen and myself accordingly set out leaving the other two with the wounded mulatto with directions to inform us when we deviated from a right line to the pine trees This they were able to do by attending to the noise we made with nearly as much accuracy as if they had seen us The atmosphere had now become a little cloudy and the morning was very dark even in the oak woods but when we had entered the thickets of the swamp all objects became utterly invisible and the obscurity was as total as if our eyes had been closed Our companions on the dry ground lost sight of the pine trees and could not give us any directions in our journey We became entangled in briers and vines and mats of bushes from which the greatest exertions were necessary to disengage ourselves It was so dark that we could not see the fallen trees and missing these fell into quagmires and sloughes of mud and water into which we sunk up to the arm-pits and from which we were able to extricate ourselves only be seizing upon the hanging branches of the surrounding trees After struggling in this half-drowned condition for at least a quarter of an hour we reached a small dry spot where the gentlemen again held a council as to ulterior measures They called to those left on the shore to know if we were proceeding toward the pine trees but received for answer that the pines were invisible and they knew not whether we were right or wrong In this state of uncertainty it was thought most prudent to wait the coming of day in our present resting place The air was frosty and in our wet clothes loaded as we were with mud it may be imagined that our feelings were not pleasant and when the day broke it brought us but little relief for we found as as it was light enough to enable us to see around that we were on one of those insulated dry spots called tussocks by the people of the south These tussocks are formed by clusters of small trees which taking root in the mud are in process of time surrounded by long grass which entwining its roots with those of the trees overspread and cover the surface of the muddy foundation by which the superstructure is supported These tussocks are often several yards in diameter That upon which we now were stood in the midst of a great miry pool into which we were again obliged to launch ourselves and struggle onward for a distance of ten yards before we reached the line of some fallen and decaying trees It was now broad daylight and we saw the pine trees at the distance of about a hundred yards from us but even with the assistance of the light we had great difficulty in reaching them--to do which we were compelled to travel at least a quarter of a mile by the angles and curves of the fallen timber upon which alone we could walk this part of the swamp being a vast half-fluid bog It was sunrise when we reached the pines which we found standing upon a small islet of firm ground containing as well as I could judge about half an acre covered with a heavy growth of white maples swamp oaks a few large pines and a vast mat of swamp laurel called in the south ivy I had no doubt that the object of our search was somewhere on this little island but small as it was it was no trifling affair to give every part of it a minute examination for the stems and branches of the ivy were so minutely interwoven with each other and spread along the ground in so many curves and crossings that it was impossible to proceed a single rod without lying down and creeping along the earth The gentlemen agreed that if any one discovered the young lady he should immediately call to the others and we all entered the thicket I however turned along the edge of the island with the intention of making its circuit for the purpose of tracing if possible the footsteps of those who had passed between it and the main shore I made my way more than half round the island without much difficulty and without discovering any signs of persons having been here before me but in crossing the trunk of a large tree which had fallen and the top of which extended far into the ivy I perceived some stains of mud on the bark of the log Looking into the swamp I saw that the root of this tree was connected with other fallen timber extending beyond the reach of my vision which was obstructed by the bramble of the swamp and the numerous ever-greens growing here I now advanced along the trunk of the tree until I reached its topmost branches and here discovered evident signs of a small trail leading into the thicket of ivy Creeping along and following this trail by the small bearberry bushes that had been trampled down and had not again risen to an erect position I was led almost across the island and found that the small bushes were discomposed quite up to the edge of a vast heap of the branches of ever-green trees produced by the falling of several large juniper cypress trees which grew in the swamp in a cluster and having been blown down had fallen with their tops athwart each other and upon the almost impervious mat of ivies with which the surface of the island was coated over I stood and looked at this mass of entangled green brush but could not perceive the slightest marks of any entrance into its labyrinths nor did it seem possible for any creature larger than a squirrel to penetrate it It now for the first time struck me as a great oversight in the gentlemen that they had not compelled the mulatto David to describe the place where they had concealed the lady and as the forest was so dense that no communication could be had with the shore either by words or signs we could not now procure any information on this subject I therefore called to the gentlemen who were on the island with me and desired them to come to me without delay Small as this island was it was after the lapse of many minutes that the overseer and the other gentlemen arrived where I stood and when they came they would have been the subjects of mirthful emotions had not the tragic circumstances in which I was placed banished from my heart every feeling but that of the most profound melancholy When the gentlemen had assembled I informed them of signs of footsteps that I had traced from the other side of the island and told them that I believed the young lady lay somewhere under the heap of brushwood before us This opinion obtained but little credit because there was no opening in the brush by which any one could enter it but on going a few paces round the heap I perceived a small shaggy pole resting on the brush and nearly concealed by it with the lower end stuck in the ground The branches had been cut from this pole at the distance of three or four inches from the main stem which made it a tolerable substitute for a ladder I immediately ascended the pole which led me to the top of the pile and here I discovered an opening in the brush between the forked top of one of the cypress trees through which a man might easily pass Applying my head to this aperture I distinctly heard a quick and laborious breathing like that of a person in extreme illness and again called the gentlemen to follow me When they came up the ladder the breathing was audible to all and one of the gentlemen whom I now perceived to be the stranger who was with us in my master's cellar when I was bled slid down into the dark and narrow passage without uttering a word I confess that some feelings of trepidation passed through my nerves when I stood alone but now that a leader had preceded me I followed and glided through the smooth and elastic cypress tops to the bottom of this vast labyrinth of green boughs When I reached the ground I found myself in contact with the gentleman who was in advance of me and near one end of a large concave oblong open space formed by the branches of the trees having been supported and kept above the ground partly by a cluster of very large and strong ivies that grew here and partly by a young gum tree which had been bent into the form of in arch by the falling timber Though we could not see into this leafy cavern from above yet when we had been in it a few moments we had light enough to see the objects around us with tolerable clearness but that which surprised us both greatly was that the place was totally silent and we could not perceive the appearance of any living thing except ourselves After we had been here some minutes our vision became still more distinct and I saw at the other end of the open space ashes of wood and some extinguished brands but there was no smoke Going to these ashes and stirring them with a stick I found coals of fire carefully covered over in a hole six or eight inches deep When he saw the fire the gentleman spoke to me and expressed his astonishment that we heard the breathing no longer but he had scarcely uttered these words when a faint groan as of a woman in great pain was heard to issue apparently from the ground but a motion of branches on our right assured me that the sufferer was concealed there The gentleman sprung to the spot pushed aside the pendant boughs stooped low beneath the bent ivies and came out bearing in his hands a delicate female figure As he turned round and exposed her half-closed eye and white forehead to the light he exclaimed Eternal God Maria is it you He then pressed her to his bosom and sunk upon the ground still holding her closely in his embrace The lady lay motionless in his arms and I thought she was dead Her hair hung matted and dishevelled from her head a handkerchief once white but now soiled with dust and stained with blood was bound firmly round her head covering her mouth and chin and was fastened at the back of the neck by a double knot and secured by a ligature of cypress bark I knew not whom most to pity--the lady who now lay insensible in the arms that still clasped her tenderly or the unhappy gentleman who having cut the cords from her limbs and the handkerchief from her face now sat and silently gazed upon her death-like countenance He uttered not a sigh and moved not a joint but his breast heaved with agony the sinews and muscles of his neck rose and fell like those of a man in convulsions all the lineaments of his face were alternately contracted and expanded as if his last moments were at hand whilst great drops of sweat rolled down his forehead as though he struggled against an enemy whose strength was more than human Oppressed by the sight of so much wretchedness I turned from its contemplation and called aloud to the gentlemen without who had all this time been waiting to hear from us to come up the ladder to the top of the pile of boughs The overseer was quickly at the top of the opening by which I had descended and I now informed him that we had found the lady He ordered me to hand her up--and I desired the gentleman who was with me to permit me to do so but this he refused--and mounting the boughs of the fallen trees and support himself by the strong branches of the ivies he quickly reached the place where the overseer stood He even here refused to part from his charge but bore her down the ladder alone He was however obliged to accept aid in conveying her through the swamp to the place where we had left the two gentlemen with the wounded mulatto whose sufferings demon as he was were sufficient to move the hardest heart His right arm and left leg were broken and he had lost much blood before we returned from the island and as he could not walk it was necessary to carry him home We had not brought any horses and until the lady was recovered no one seemed to think any more about the mulatto after he was shot down It was proposed to send for a horse to take David home but it was finally agreed that we should leave him in the woods where he was until a man could be sent for him with a cart At the time we left him his groans and lamentations seemed to excite no sympathy in the breast of any More cruel sufferings yet awaited him The lady was carried home in the arms of the gentlemen and she did not speak until after she was bathed and put to bed in my master's house as I afterwards heard I know she did not speak on the way She died on the fourth day after her rescue and before her death related the circumstances of her misfortune as I was told by a coloured woman who attended her in her illness in the following manner As she was riding in the dusk of the evening at a rapid trot a few yards behind her brother a black man sprang from behind a tree standing close by the side of the road seized her by her riding dress and dragged her to the ground but failed to catch the bridle of the horse which sprang off at full speed Another negro immediately came to the aid of the first and I could not catch him--we must make haste They carried her as fast as they could go to the place where we found her when they bound her hands feet and mouth and left her until the next night and had left her the second morning only a few minutes when she heard the report of guns Soon after this by great efforts she extricated one of her feet from the bark with which she was bound but finding herself too weak to stand she crawled as far as she could under the boughs of the trees hoping that when her assassins returned again they would not be able to find her and that she might there die alone Exhausted by the efforts she had made to remove herself she fell into the stupor of sleep from which she was aroused by the noise we made when we descended into the cavern She then supposing us to be her destroyers returned again lay still and breathed as softly as possible to prevent us from hearing her but when she heard the voice of the gentleman who was with me the tones of which were familiar to her she groaned and moved her feet to let us know where she was This exertion and the idea of her horrid condition overcame the strength of her nerves and when her deliverer raised her from the ground she had swooned and was unconscious of all things We had no sooner arrived at the house than inquiry was made for Hardy but it was ascertained in the kitchen that he had not been seen since the previous evening at night fall when he had left the kitchen for the purpose of going to sleep at the stable with David as he had told one of the black women and preparation was immediately made to go in pursuit of him For this purpose all the gentlemen present equipped themselves with pistols fowling pieces and horns--such as are used by fox hunters Messengers were despatched round the country to give notice to all the planters within the distance of many miles of the crime that had been committed and of the escape of one of its perpetrators with a request to them to come without delay and join in the pursuit intended to be given Those who had dogs trained to chase thieves were desired to bring them and a gentleman who lived twelve miles off and who owned a blood hound was sent for and requested to come with his dog in all haste In consequence I suppose of the information I had given I was permitted to be present at these deliberations and though my advice was not asked I was often interrogated concerning my knowledge of the affair Some proposed to go at once with dogs and horses into the woods and traverse the swamp and thickets for the purpose of rousing Hardy from the place of concealment he might have chosen but the opinion of the overseer prevailed who thought that from the intimate knowledge possessed by him of all the swamps and coverts in the neighbourhood there would be little hope of discovering him in this manner The overseer advised them to wait the coming of the gentleman with his blood hound before they entered the woods for the reason that if the blood hound could be made to take the trail he would certainly find his game before he quit it if not thrown off the scent by the men horses and dogs crossing his course but if the blood hound could not take the scent they might then adopt the proposed plan of pursuit with as much success as at present This counsel being adopted the horses were ordered into the stable and the gentlemen entered the house to take their breakfast and wait the arrival of the blood hound Nothing was of the mulatto David who seemed to be forgotten--not a word being spoken by any one of bringing him from the woods I knew that he was suffering the most agonizing pains and great as were his crimes his groans and cries of anguish still seemed to echo in my ears but I was afraid to make any application in his behalf lest even yet I might be suspected of some participation in his offences for I knew that the most horrid punishments were often inflicted upon slaves merely on suspicion As the morning advanced the number of men and horses in front of my master's mansion increased and before ten o'clock I think there were at least fifty of each--the horses standing hitched and the men conversing in groups without or as-together within the house At length the owner of the blood hound came bringing with him his dog in a chaise drawn by one horse The harness was removed from the horse its place supplied by a saddle and bridle and the whole party set off for the woods As they rode away my master who was one of the company told me to follow them but we had proceeded only a little distance when the gentlemen stopped and my master after speaking with the owner of the dog told the overseer to go back to the house and get some piece of the clothes of Hardy that had been worn by him lately The overseer returned and we all proceeded forward to the place where David lay We found him where we had left him greatly weakened by the loss of blood and complaining that the cold air caused his wounds to smart intolerably When I came near him he looked at me and told me I had betrayed him None of the gentlemen seemed at all moved by his sufferings and when any of them spoke to him it was with derision and every epithet of scorn and contumely As it was apparent that he could not escape no one proposed to remove him to a place of greater safety but several of the horsemen as they passed lashed him with the thongs of their whips but I do not believe he felt these blows--the pain he endured from his wounds being so great as to drown the sensation of such minor afflictions The day had already become warm although the night had been cold the sun shone with great clearness and many carrion crows attracted by the scent of blood were perched upon the trees near where we now were When the overseer came up with us he brought an old blanket in which Hardy had slept for some time and handed it to the owner of the dog who having first caused the hound to smell of the blanket untied the cord in which he had been led and turned him into the woods The dog went from us fifty or sixty yards in a right line then made a circle around us again commenced his circular movement and pursued it nearly half round Then he dropped his nose to the ground snuffed the tainted surface and moved off through the woods slowly almost touching the earth with his nose The owner of the dog and twelve or fifteen others followed him whilst the residue of the party dispersed themselves along the edge of the swamp and the overseer ordered me to stay and watch the horses of those who dismounted going himself on foot in the pursuit When the gentlemen were all gone out of sight I went to David who lay all this time within my view for the purpose of asking him if I could render him any assistance He begged me to bring him some water as he was dying of thirst no less than with the pain of his wounds One of the horsemen had left a large tin horn hanging on his saddle this I took and stopping the small end closely with leaves filled it with water from the swamp and gave it to the wounded man who drank it and then turning his head towards me --Hardy and I had laid plan to have this thing brought upon you and to have you hung for it--but you have escaped He then asked me if they intended to leave him to die in the woods or to take him home and hang him I told him I had heard them talk of taking him home in a cart but what was to be done with him I did not know I felt a horror of the crimes committed by this man was pained by the sight of his sufferings and being unable to relieve the one or to forgive the other went to a place where I could neither see nor hear him and sat down to await the return of those who had gone in pursuit of Hardy In the circumstances which surrounded me it cannot be supposed that my feelings were pleasant or that time moved very fleetly but painful as my situation was I was obliged to bear it for many hours From the time the gentlemen left me I neither saw nor heard them until late in the afternoon when five or six of them returned having lost their companions in the woods Toward sundown I heard a great noise of horns blown and of men shouting at a distance in the forest and soon after my master the owner of the blood hound and many others returned bringing with them Hardy whom the hound had followed ten or twelve miles through the swamps and thickets had at last caught him and would soon have killed him had he not been compelled to relinquish his prey When the party had all returned a kind of court was held in the woods where we then were for the purpose of determining what punishment should be inflicted upon Hardy and David All agreed at once that an example of the most terrific character ought to be made of such atrocious villains and that it would defeat the ends of Justice to deliver these fellows up to the civil authority to be hanged like common murderers The next measure was to settle upon the kind of punishment to be inflicted upon them and the manner of executing the sentence Hardy was all this time sitting on the ground covered with blood and yet bleeding profusely in hearing of his inexorable judges The dog had mangled both his arms and hands in a shocking manner torn a large piece of flesh entirely away from one side of his breast and sunk his fangs deep in the side of his neck No other human creature that I have ever seen presented a more deplorable spectacle of mingled crime and cruelty It was now growing late and the fate of these miserable men was to be decided before the company separated to go to their several homes One proposed to burn them another to flay them alive and a third to starve them to death and many other modes of slowly and tormentingly extinguishing life were named but that which was finally adopted was of all others the most horrible The wretches were unanimously sentenced to be stripped naked and bound down securely upon their backs on the naked earth in sight of each other to have their mouths closely covered with bandages to prevent them from making a noise to frighten away the birds and in this manner to be left to be devoured alive by the carrion crows and buzzards which swarm in every part of South Carolina The sentence was instantly carried into effect so far as its execution depended on us Hardy and his companion were divested of their clothes stretched upon their backs on the ground their mouths bandaged with handkerchiefs--their limbs extended-- and these together with their necks being crossed by numerous poles were kept close to the earth by forked sticks driven into the ground so as to prevent the possibility of moving any part of their persons and in this manner these wicked men were left to be torn in pieces by birds of prey The buzzards and carrion crows always attack dead bodies by pulling out and consuming the eyes first They then tear open the bowels and feed upon the intestines We returned to my master's plantation and I did not see this place again until the next Sunday when several of my fellow-slaves went with me to see the remains of the dead but we found only their bones Great flocks of buzzards and carrion crows were assembled in the trees giving a dismal aspect to the woods and I hastened to abandon a place fraught with so many afflicting recollections The lady who had been the innocent sacrifice of the brutality of the men whose bones I had seen bleaching in the sun had died on Saturday evening and her corpse was buried on Monday in a graveyard on my master's plantation I have never seen a large cotton plantation in Carolina without its burying ground This burying ground is not only the place of sepulture of the family who are the proprietors of the estate but also of many other persons who have lived in the neighbourhood Half an acre or an acre of ground is appropriated as a grave-yard on one side of which the proprietors of the estate from age to age are buried whilst the other parts of the ground are open to strangers poor people of their vicinity and in general to all who choose to inter their dead within its boundaries This custom prevails as far north as Maryland and it seems to me to be much more consonant to the feelings of solitude and tender recollections which we always associate with the memory of departed friends than the practice of promiscuous interment in a church-yard where all idea of seclusion is banished by the last home of the dead being thrown open to the rude intrusions of strangers where the sanctity of the sepulchre is treated as a common and where the grave itself is in a few years torn up or covered over to form a temporary resting place for some new tenant The family of the deceased lady though not very wealthy was amongst the most ancient and respectable in this part of the country and on Sunday whilst the body lay in my master's house there was a continual influx and efflux of visiters in carriages on horse-back and on foot The house was open to all who chose to come and the best wines cakes sweet-meats and fruits were handed about to the company by the servants though I observed that none remained for dinner except the relations of the deceased those of my master's family and the young gentleman who was with me on the island The visiters remained but a short time when they came and were nearly all in mourning This was the first time that I had seen a large number of the fashionable people of Carolina assembled together and their appearance impressed me with an opinion favourable to their character I had never seen an equal number of people anywhere whose deportment was more orderly and decorous nor whose feelings seemed to be more in accordance with the solemnity of the event which had brought them together I had been ordered by the overseer to remain at the great house until the afternoon for the purpose as I afterwards learned of being seen by those who came to see the corpse and many of the ladies and gentlemen inquired for me and when I was pointed out to them commended my conduct and fidelity in discovering the authors of the murder--condoled with me for having suffered innocently and several gave me money One old lady who came in a pretty carriage drawn by two black horses gave me a dollar On Monday the funeral took place and several hundred persons followed the corpse to the grave over which a minister delivered a short sermon The young gentleman who was with me when we found the deceased on the island walked with her Mother to the grave-yard and the little brother followed with a younger sister After the interment wines and refreshments were handed round to the whole assembly and at least a hundred persons remained for dinner with my master's family At four o'clock in the afternoon the carriages and horses were ordered to the door of the court-yard of the house and the company retired At sundown the plantation was as quiet as if its peace had never been disturbed XIV I have before observed that the negroes of the cotton plantations are exceedingly superstitious and they are indeed prone beyond all other people that I have ever known to believe in ghosts and the existence of an infinite number of supernatural agents No story of a miraculous character can be too absurd to obtain credit with them and a narrative is not the less eagerly listened to nor the more cautiously received because it is impossible in its circumstances Within a few weeks after the deaths of the two malefactors to whose horrible crimes were awarded equally horrible punishments the forest that had been the scene of these bloody deeds was reported and believed to be visited at night by beings of unearthly make whose groans and death-struggles were heard in the darkest recesses of the woods amidst the flapping of the wings of vultures the fluttering of carrion crows and the dismal croaking of ravens In the midst of this nocturnal din the noise caused by the tearing of the flesh from the bones was heard and the panting breath of the agonized sufferer quivering under the beaks of his tormentors as they consumed his vitals floated audibly upon the evening breeze The murdered lady was also seen walking by moonlight near the spot where she had been dragged from her horse wrapped in a blood-stained mantle overhung with gory and dishevelled locks The little island in the swamp was to present spactacles too horrible for human eyes to look upon and sounds were heard to issue from it which no human ear could bear Terrific and ghastly fires were seen to burst up at midnight amongst the ever-greens that clad this lonely spot emitting scents too suffocating and sickly to be endured whilst demoniac yells shouts of despair and groans of agony mingled their echos in the solitude of the woods Whilst I remained in this neighbourhood no coloured person ever travelled this road alone after night-fall and many white men would have ridden ten miles round the country to avoid the passage of the ridge road after dark Generations must pass away before the tradition of this place will be forgotten and many a year will open and close before the last face will be pale or the last heart beat as the twilight traveller skirts the borders of the Murderers' Swamp We had allowances of meat distributed to all the people twice this fall--once when we had finished the saving of the fodder and again soon after the murder of the young lady The first time we had beef such as I had driven from the woods went to the alligator pond but now we had two hogs given to us which weighed one a hundred and thirty and the other a hundred and fifty-six pounds This was very good pork and I received a pound and a quarter as my share of it This was the first pork that I had tasted in Carolina and it afforded a real feast We had in our family full seven pounds of good fat meat and as we now had plenty of sweet potatoes both in our gardens and in our weekly allowance we had on the Sunday following the funeral as good a dinner of stewed pork and potatoes as could have been found in all Carolina We did not eat all our meat on Sunday but kept part of it until Tuesday when we warmed it in a pot with an addition of parsley and other herbs and had another very comfortable meal I had by this time become in some measure acquainted with the country and began to lay and execute plans to procure supplies of such things as were not allowed me by my master I understood various methods of entrapping rackoons and other wild animals that abounded in the large swamps of this country and besides the skins which were worth something for their furs I generally procured as many rackoons opossums and rabbits as afforded us two or three meals in a week The woman with whom I lived understood the way of dressing an opossum and I was careful to provide one for our Sunday dinner every week so long as these animals continued fat and in good condition All the people on the plantation did not live as well as our family did for many of the men did not understand trapping game and others were too indolent to go far enough from home to find good places for setting their traps My principal trapping ground was three miles from home and I went three times a week always after night to bring home my game and keep my traps in good order Many of the families in the quarter caught no game and had no meat except that which we received from the overseer which averaged about six or seven meals in the year Lydia the woman whom I have mentioned heretofore was one of the women whose husbands procured little or nothing for the sustenance of their families and I often gave her a quarter of a rackoon or a small opossum for which she appeared very thankful Her health was not good--she had a bad cough and often told me she was feverish and restless at night It appeared clear to me that this woman's constitution was broken by hardships and sufferings and that she could not live long in her present mode of existence Her husband a native of a country far in the interior of Africa he had been a priest in his own nation and had never been taught to do any kind of labour being supported by the contributions of the public and he now maintained as far as he could the same kind of lazy dignity that he had enjoyed at home He was compelled by the overseer to work with the other hands in the field but as soon as he had come into his cabin he took his seat and refused to give his wife the least assistance in doing any thing She was consequently obliged to do the little work that it was necessary to perform in the cabin and also to bear all the labour of weeding and cultivating the family patch or garden The husband was a morose sullen man and he formerly had ten wives in his own country who all had to work for and wait upon him and he thought himself badly off here in having but one woman to do any thing for him This man was very irritable and often beat and otherwise maltreated his wife on the slightest provocation and the overseer refused to protect her on the ground that he never interfered in the family quarrels of the black people I pitied this woman greatly but as it was not in my power to remove her from the presence and authority of her husband I thought it prudent not to say nor do any thing to provoke him further against her As the winter approached and the autumnal rains set in she was frequently exposed in the field and was wet for several hours together this joined to the want of warm and comfortable woollen clothes caused her to contract colds and hoarseness which increased the severity of her cough A few days before Christmas her child died after an illness of only three days I assisted her and her husband to inter the infant--which was a little boy --and its father buried with it a small bow and several arrows a little bag of parched meal a miniature canoe about a foot long and a little paddle with which he it would cross the ocean to his own country a small stick with an iron nail sharpened and fastened into one end of it and a piece of white muslin with several curious and strange figures painted on it in blue and red by which he his relations and countrymen would know the infant to be his son and would receive it accordingly on its arrival amongst them Cruel as this man was to his wife I could not but respect the sentiments which inspired his affection for his child though it was the affection of a barbarian He cut a lock of hair from his head threw it upon the dead infant and closed the grave with his own hands He then told us the God of his country was looking at him and was pleased with what he had done Thus ended the funeral service As we returned home Lydia told me she was rejoiced that her child was dead and out of a world in which slavery and wretchedness must have been its only portion I am now she ready to follow my child and the sooner I go the better for me She went with us to the field until the month of January when as we were returning from our work one stormy and wet evening she told me she should never pick any more cotton--that her strength was gone and she could work no more When we assembled at the blowing of the horn on the following morning Lydia did not appear The overseer who had always appeared to dislike this woman when he missed her swore very angrily and he supposed she was pretending to be sick but if she was he would soon cure her He then stepped into his house and took some copperas front a little bag and mixed it with water I followed him to Lydia's cabin where he compelled her to drink this solution of copperas It caused her to vomit violently and made her exceedingly sick I think to this day that this act of the overseer was the most inhuman of all those that I have seen perpetrated upon defenceless slaves Lydia was removed that same day to the sick room in a state of extreme debility and exhaustion When she left this room again she was a corpse Her disease was a consumption of the lungs which terminated her life early in March I assisted in carrying her to the grave which I closed upon her and covered with green turf She sleeps by the side of her infant in a corner of the negro grave-yard of this plantation Death was to her a welcome messenger who came to remove her from toil that she could not support and from misery that she could not sustain Her life had been a morning of pleasure but a day of bitterness upon which no sunlight had fallen Had she known no other mode of existence than that which she saw on this plantation her lot would have been happiness itself in comparison with her actual destiny Trained up as she had been in Maryland no greater cruelty could have been devised by the malice of her most cunning enemy than to transfer her from the service and almost companionship of an indulgent and affectionate mistress to the condition in which I saw her and knew her in the cotton fields of South Carolina In Maryland it is a custom as widely extended as the state itself I believe to give the slaves a week of holidays at Christmas and the master who should attempt to violate this usage would become an object of derision amongst his neighbours But I learned long before Christmas that the force of custom was not so binding here as it is farther north In Maryland Christmas comes at a season of leisure when the work of the farm or the tobacco plantation is generally closed for the year and if a good supply of firewood has been provided there seems to be but little for the people to do and a week lost to the master is a matter of little moment at a period when the days are short and cold but in the cotton country the case is very different Christmas comes in the very midst of cotton picking The richest and best part of the crop has been secured before this period it is true but large quantities of cotton still remain in the field and every pound that can be saved from the winds or the plough of the next spring is a gain of its value to the owner of the estate For these reasons which are very powerful on the side of the master there is but little Christmas on a large cotton plantation In lieu of the week of holiday which formerly prevailed even in Carolina before cotton was cultivated as a crop the master now gives the people a dinner of meat on Christmas-day and distributes amongst them their annual allowance of winter clothes on estates where such an allowance is made and where it is not some small gratuity supplies its place There are cotton planters who give no clothes to their slaves but expect them to supply themselves with apparel out of the proceeds of their Sunday labour and nightly earnings Clothes of a certain quality were given to the people of the estate on which I lived at the time of which I now speak but they were not at all sufficient to keep us warm and comfortable in the winter and the residue we had to procure for ourselves In Georgia I lived three years with one master and the best master too that I ever had in the south who never gave me any clothes during that period except an old great coat and a pair of boots--I shall have occasion to speak of him hereafter As Christmas of the year approached we were all big with hope of obtaining three or four days at least if not a week of holiday but when the day at length arrived we were sorely disappointed for on Christmas eve when we had come from the field with our cotton the overseer fell into a furious passion and swore at us all for our laziness and many other bad qualities He then told us that he had intended to give us three days if we had worked well but that we had been so idle and had left so much cotton yet to be picked in the field that he found it impossible to give us more than one day but that he would go to the house and endeavour to procure a meat dinner for us and a dram in the morning Accordingly on the next morning we received a dram of peach brandy for each person and two hogs weighing together more than three hundred were slaughtered and divided amongst us I went to the field and picked cotton all day for which I was paid by the overseer and at night I had a good dinner of stewed pork and sweet potatoes--Such were the beginning and end of my first Christmas on a cotton plantation We went to work as usual the next morning and continued our labour through the week as if Christmas had been stricken from the calender I had already saved and laid by a little more than ten dollars in money but part of it had been given to me at the funeral I was now much in want of clothes none having been given me since I came here I had at the commencement of the cold weather cut up my old blanket and with the aid of Lydia who was a very good seamstress converted it into a pair of trousers and a long roundabout jacket but this deprived me of my bed which was imperfectly supplied by mats which I made of rushes The mats were very comfortable things to lie upon but they were by no means equal to blankets for covering A report had been current amongst us for some time that there would be a distribution of clothes to the people at new-year's-day but how much or what kind of clothes we were to get no one pretended to know except that we were to get shoes in conformity to a long-established rule of this plantation From Christmas to new-year appeared a long to week to me and I have no doubt that it longer to some of my fellow-slaves most of whom were entirely barefoot I had made mockasins for myself of the skins of squirrels that I had caught in my traps and by this means protected my feet from the frost which was sometimes very heavy and sharp in the morning On the first day of January when we met at the blowing of the morning horn the overseer told us we must all proceed to the great house where we were to receive our winter clothes and surely no order was ever more willingly obeyed When we arrived at the house our master was up and we were all called into the great court yard in front of the dwelling The overseer now told us that shoes would be given to all those who were able to go to the field to pick cotton This deprived of shoes the children and several old persons whose eye-sight was not sufficiently clear to enable them to pick cotton A new blanket was then given to every one above seven years of age--children under seven received no blanket being left to be provided for by their parents Children of this age and under go entirely naked in the day-time and sleep with their mothers at night or are wrapped up together such bedding as the mother may possess Children under seven years of age are of little use in picking cotton and it is not supposed that their labour can repay the expense of clothing them in a manner to fit them to go to the field--they are therefore suffered to remain in the house or quarter without clothes from October to April In summer they do not require clothes and can perform such work as they are able to do as well without garments as with them At the time we received our shoes and blankets there was not a good shirt in our quarter--but all the men and women had provided themselves with some sort of woollen clothes out of their own savings Woollen stuff for a petticoat and shortgown had also been given before Christmas to each of the women who were mothers of small children or in such a condition as to render it certain that they must in a short time become so Many of the women could pick as much cotton as a man and any good hand could earn sixty cents by picking cotton on Sunday--the overseer paying us punctually for all the cotton we brought in on Sunday evening Besides this a good hand could always in a fine day pick more cotton than was required to be brought home as a day's work I could not pick as much in a day as some of the others by four or five pounds but I could generally carry home as much beyond the day's work or task as it is called as entitled me to receive from five to ten cents every evening from the overseer This money was punctually paid to me every Saturday night and in some weeks I cleared in this way as high as fifty cents over and above what I earned on Sunday One of the men cleared to himself including his Sunday work two dollars a week for several weeks and his savings on this entire crop of cotton were thirty-one dollars--but he was a first-rate cotton picker and worked late and early One of the women cleared twenty-six dollars to herself in the same way We were expected to clothe ourselves with these and our other extra earnings but some of the people performed no more work through the week than their regular task and would not work constantly on Sunday Such were not able to provide themselves with good clothes and many of them suffered greatly from the cold in the course of the winter When the weather was mild and pleasant some of the children who were not required to go to the field to do a day's work would go out in the warmest part of the day and pick a few pounds of cotton for which their parents received pay and were obliged in return to find the children in bedding for the winter A man can plant and cultivate more cotton plants than he is afterwards able to pick the wool from if the season is good and no disaster befalls the crop Here every effort is made from the commencement of the picking season until its close to procure as much work as possible from the hands and spite of all that can be done much cotton is lost--the people not being able to pick it all from the stalks before the field is ploughed up to prepare the ground for the reception of the seeds of a new crop In such cases every pound that the hands can be induced to pick beyond their daily task is a clear gain to the master and slaves often leave the fields of their masters where the cotton is nearly all gathered and the picking is poor to go to the field of some neighbouring planter where the cotton is more abundant to work on Sunday It is a matter of indifference to the slave whether his master gets his cotton all picked or not his object is to get employment in a field where he can make the best wages In such cases the masters often direct the overseers to offer their own slaves one half as much as the cotton is worth for each pound they will pick on Sunday--and this for the purpose of preventing them from going to some other field to work on that day The usual price only is paid for extra cotton picked on working days for after a hand has picked his task he would not have time to go anywhere else to work nor indeed would he be permitted to leave his plantation The slave is a kind of freeman on Sunday all over the southern country and it is in truth by the exercise of his liberty on this day that he is enabled to provide himself and his family with many of the necessaries of life that his master refuses to supply him with It is altogether impossible to make a person residing in any of the middle or northern states of the Union and who has never been in the south throughly acquainted with all the minute particulars of the life of a slave on a cotton plantation or to give him an idea of the system of parsimonious economy that the slave is obliged to exercise and maintain in his little household Poor as the slave is and dependant at all times upon the arbitrary will of his master or yet more fickle caprice of the overseer his children look up to him in his little cabin as their protector and supporter There is always in every cabin except in times of scarcity after there has been a failure of the corn crop a sufficient supply of either corn bread or sweet potatoes and either of these is sufficient to give health and vigour to children who are not required to do any work but a person who is grown up and is obliged to labour hard finds either bread or potatoes or even both together quite inadequate to sustain the body in the full and powerful tone of muscular action that more generous food would bestow A mother will imagine the painful feelings experienced by a parent in the cabin of a slave when a small portion of animal food is procured dressed and made ready for the table The father and mother know that it is not only food but medicine to them and their appetites keenly court the precious morsel whilst the children whose senses are all acute seem to be indued with taste and smell in a tenfold degree and manifest a ravenous craving for fresh meat which it is painful to witness without being able to gratify it During the whole of this fall and winter we usually had something to roast at least twice a week in our cabin These roasts were rackoons opossums and other game--the proceeds of my trapping All the time the meat was hanging at the fire as well as while it was on the table our house was surrounded by the children of our fellow-slaves some begging for a piece and all expressing by their eager countenances the keen desire they felt to partake with us of our dainties It was idle to think of sharing with them the contents of our board for they were often thirty or forty in number and the largest rackoon would scarcely have made a mouthful for each of them There was one little boy four years old a very fine little fellow to whom I had become warmly attached and who used to share with me in all the good things I possessed He was of the same age with my own little son whom I had left in Maryland and there was nothing that I possessed in the world that I would not have divided with him even to my last crust It may well be supposed that in our society although we were all slaves and all nominally in a condition of the most perfect equality yet there was in fact a very great difference in the manner of living in the several families Indeed I doubt if there is as great a diversity in the modes of life in the several families of any white village in New-York or Pennsylvania containing a population of three hundred persons as there was in the several households of our quarter This may be illustrated by the following circumstance Before I came to reside in the family with whom I lived at this time they seldom tasted animal food or even fish except on meat-days as they were called that is when meat was given to the people by the overseer under the orders of our master The head of the family was a very quiet worthy man but slothful and inactive in his habits When he had come from the field at night he seldom thought of leaving the cabin again before morning He would and did make baskets and mats and earned some money by these means he also did his regular day's work on Sunday but all his acquirements were not sufficient to enable him to provide any kind of meat for his family All that his wife and children could do was to provide him with work at his baskets and mats and they lived even then better than some of their neighbours After I came among them and had acquired some knowledge of the surrounding country I made as many baskets and mats as he did and took time to go twice a week to look at all my traps As the winter passed away and spring approached the proceeds of my hunting began to diminish The game became scarce and both rackoons and opossums grew poor and worthless It was necessary for me to discover some new mode of improving allowance allotted to me by the overseer I had all my life been accustomed to fishing in Maryland and I now resolved to resort to the water for a living the land having failed to furnish me a comfortable subsistence With these views I set out one Sunday morning early in February and went to the river at a distance of three miles from home From the appearance of the stream I felt confident that it must contain many fish and I went immediately to work to make a weir With the help of an axe that I had with me I had finished before night the frame work of a weir of pine sticks lashed together with white oak splits I had no canoe but made a raft of dry logs upon which I went to a suitable place in the river and set my weir I afterwards made a small net of twine that I bought at the store and on next Thursday night I took as many fish from my weir as filled a half bushel measure This was a real treasure--it was the most fortunate circumstance that had happened with me since I came to the country I was enabled to show my generosity but like all mankind even in my liberality I kept myself in mind I gave a large fish to the overseer and took three more to the great house These were the first fresh fish that had been in the family this season and I was much praised by my master and young mistresses for my skill and success in fishing but this was all the advantage I received from this effort to court the favour of the great--I did not even get a dram The part I had performed in the detection of the murderers of the young lady was forgotten or at least not mentioned now I went away from the house not only disappointed but chagrined and thought with myself that if my master and young mistresses had nothing but words to give me for my fish we should not carry on a very large traffic On next Sunday morning a black boy came from the house and told me that our master wished to see me This summons was not to be disobeyed When I returned to the mansion I went round to the kitchen and sent word by one of the house-slaves that I had come The servant returned and told me that I was to stay in the kitchen and get my breakfast and after that to come into the house A very good breakfast was sent to me from my master's table after the family had finished their morning meal and when I had done with my repast I went into the parlour I was received with great affability by my master who told me he had sent for me to know if I had been accustomed to fish in the place I had come from I informed him that I had been employed at a fishery on the Patuxent every spring for several years and that I thought I understood fishing with a seine as well as most people He then asked me if I could knit a seine to which I replied in the affirmative After some other questions he told me that as the picking of cotton was nearly over for this season and the fields must soon be ploughed up for a new crop he had a thought of having a seine made and of placing me at the head of a fishing party for the purpose of trying to take a supply of fish for his hands No communication could have been more unexpected than this was and it was almost as pleasing to me as it was unexpected by me I now began to hope that there would be some respite from the labours of the cotton field and that I should not be doomed to drag out a dull and monotonous existence within the confines of the enclosures of the plantation In Maryland the fishing season was always one of hard labour it is true but also a time of joy and hilarity We then had throughout the time of fishing plenty of bread and at least bacon enough to fry our fish with We had also a daily allowance of whiskey or brandy and we always considered ourselves fortunate when we left the farm to go to the fishery A few days after this I was again sent for by my master who told me that he had bought twine and ropes for a seine and that I must set to work and knit it as quickly as possible that as he did not wish the twine to be taken to the quarter I must remain with the servants in the kitchen and live with them whilst employed in constructing the seine I was assisted in making the seine by a black boy whom I had taught to work with me and by the end of two weeks we had finished our job While at work on this seine I lived rather better than I had formerly done when residing at the quarter We received amongst us--twelve in number including the people who worked in the garden-- the refuse of our master's table In this way we procured a little cold meat every day and when there were many strangers visiting the family we sometimes procured considerable quantities of cold and broken meats My new employment afforded me a better opportunity than I had hitherto possessed of making correct observations upon the domestic economy of my master's household and of learning the habits and modes of life of the persons who composed it On a great cotton plantation such as this of my master's the field hands who live in the quarter are removed so far from the domestic circle of their master's family by their servile condition and the nature of their employment that they know but little more of the transactions within the walls of the great house than if they lived ten miles off Many a slave has been born lived to old age and died on a plantation without ever having been within the walls of his master's domicil My master was a widower and his house was in charge of his sister a maiden lady apparently of fifty- five or sixty He had six children three sons and three daughters and all unmarried but only one of the sons was at home at the time I came upon the estate the other two were in some of the northern cities the one studying medicine and the other at college At the time of knitting the twine these young gentlemen had returned on a visit to their relations and all the brothers and sisters were now on the place The young ladies were all grown up and marriageable their father was known to be a man of great wealth and the girls were reputed very pretty in Carolina one of them the second of the three was esteemed a great beauty The reader might deem my young mistress' pretty face and graceful person altogether impertinent to the narrative of my own life but they had a most material influence upon my fortunes and changed the whole tenor of my existence Had she been less beautiful or of a temper less romantic and adventurous I should still have been a slave in South Carolina if yet alive and the world would have been saved the labour of perusing these s Any one at all acquainted with southern manners will at once see that my master's house possessed attractions which would not fail to draw within it numerous visiters and that the head of such a family as dwelt under its roof was not likely to be without friends I had not been at work upon the seine a week before I discovered by listening to the conversation of my master and the other members of the family that they prided themselves not a little upon the antiquity of their house and the long practice of a generous hospitality to strangers and to all respectable people who chose to visit their homestead All circumstances seemed to conspire to render this house one of the chief seats of the fashion the beauty the wit and the gallantry of South Carolina Scarcely an evening came but it brought a carriage and ladies and gentlemen and their servants and every day brought dashing young planters mounted on horseback to dine with the family but Sunday was the day of the week on which the house received the greatest accession of company My master and family were members of the Episcopal Church and attended service every Sunday when the weather was fine at a church eight miles distant Each of my young masters and mistresses had a saddlehorse and in pleasant weather they frequently all went to church on horseback leaving my old master and mistress to occupy the family carriage alone I have seen fifteen or twenty young people come to my master's for dinner on Sunday from church and very often the parson a young man of handsome appearance was amongst them I had observed these things long before but now I had come to live at the house and became more familiar with them Three Sundays intervened while I was at work upon the seine and on each of these Sundays more than twenty persons besides the family dined at my master's During these three weeks my young masters were absent far the greater part of the time but I observed that they generally came home on Sunday for dinner My young mistresses were not from home much and I believe they never left the plantation unless either their father or some one of their brothers was with them Dinner parties were frequent in my master's house and on these occasions of festivity a black man who belonged to a neighbouring estate and who played the violin was sent for I observed that whenever this man was sent for he came and sometimes even came before night which appeared a little singular to me as I knew the difficulty that coloured people had to encounter in leaving the estate to which they were attached I felt curious to ascertain how it happened that Peter that was the name of the fiddler enjoyed such privileges and contrived to become acquainted with him when he came to get his supper in the kitchen He informed me that his master was always ready to let him go to a ball and would permit him to leave the cotton field at any time for that purpose and even lend him a horse to ride I afterwards learned from this man that his master compelled him to give him half the money that he received as gratuities from the gentlemen for whom he played at the dinner parties but as his master had enjoined him under pain of being whipped not to divulge this circumstance I never betrayed the poor fellow's confidence Peter's master was a planter who owned thirty slaves and his children several of whom were young ladies and gentlemen moved in highly respectable circles of society but I believe my master's family did not treat them as quite their equals not so much on account of their inferiority in point of wealth as because they were new in the country having only been settled here but a few years and the master of Peter having when a young man acted as overseer on a rice plantation near Charleston XV I have though always in a very humble station in life travelled more and seen more of the people in the United States than some who occupy elevated ranks and claim for themselves a knowledge of the world far greater than I pretend to possess but a man's knowledge is to be valued not by that which he has imagined but by that which experience has taught him and in estimating his ability to give information to others we are to judge him not by what he says he would wish men and the world to be but by what he has seen and by the just inferences he draws from those actions that he has witnessed in the various conditions of human society that have passed in review before him In this book I do not pretend to discuss systems or advance theories I am content to give facts as I saw them In the northern and middle states so far as I have known them very little respect is paid to family pretensions and this disregard of ancestry seems to me to be the necessary offspring of the condition of things In the states of New-York and Pennsylvania there are so many ways by which men may and do arrive at distinction and so many and such various means of acquiring wealth that all claim of superiority on account of the possession of any particular kind of property is prohibited by public opinion A great landholder is counterbalanced by a great manufacturer and perhaps surpassed by a great merchant whilst a successful and skilful mechanic is the rival of all these Family distinction can obtain no place amongst these men In the plantation states the case is widely different There lands and slaves constitute the only property of the country that is worthy of being taken into an estimate of public wealth Cattle and horses hogs sheep and mules exist but in numbers so few and of qualities so inferior that the portion of them possessed by any individual planter would compose an aggregate value of sufficient magnitude only to raise him barely beyond the lines that divide poverty from mediocrity of condition The mechanic is a sort of journeyman to the planters and works about the country as he may chance to find a job in building a house erecting a cotton-gin or constructing a horse-mill if he is a carpenter or mill-wright if he is a tailor he seeks employment from house to house never remaining longer in one place than to allow himself time to do the work of the family The mechanic holds a kind of half-way rank between the gentleman and the slave He is not and never can be a gentleman for the reason that he does and must do his own work Hence mechanics and artizans of every description avoid the southern country or if found there they are only sojourners The country they are in is not their home they are there from necessity or with a hope of acquiring money to establish themselves in business in places where their occupations are held more in honour Manufacturers are not in existence in the cotton country therefore no comparison can be instituted between them and the planters I believe from what I saw that all the commerce of the cotton country is in the hands of strangers and that a large portion of these strangers are foreigners The planters deal with them from necessity as they must have such things as they need and must obtain them somewhere and from somebody The store-keeper lives as well dresses as well and often lives in as good a house as the planter--perhaps in one that is better than that of the planter but his wealth is not so material his means of subsistence do not strike the eye so powerfully as a hundred field hands and three hundred acres of cotton The country has no hold on him and he has no hold on the country His habits of life are not similar to those of his neighbours--he is not one of us All the families who visited at my master's were those of planters and the families of the cotton planters have nothing to do but visit or read hunt or fish or run into some vicious amusements or sit down and do nothing Every kind of labour is as strictly prohibited to the sons and daughters of the planters by universal custom as if a law of the land made it punishable by fine and imprisonment and gave one-half of the fine to a common informer The only line that divides the gentleman from the simple man is that the latter works for his living whilst the former has slaves to work for him No man who works with his hands can or will be received into the highest orders of society on a footing of equality nor can he hope to see his family treated better than himself This unhappy fiat of public opinion has done infinite mischief in the south Men of fortune will not work nor permit their sons to work in the field because this exemption from labour is their badge of gentility and the circumstance that distinguishes them from the less favoured members of the community As the wealthy the great and the fashionable are never seen at labour and as it is known that they hold it to be beneath the rank of a gentleman to work in the field those who are more sparingly endowed with the advantages of fortune imbibe an opinion that it is disgraceful to plough or to dig and that it is necessary to lead a life of idleness to maintain their caste in society No man works in South Carolina except under the impulse of necessity In this state of things many men of limited fortunes rear up families of children without education and without the means of supporting an expensive style of living The sons when grown up of necessity commingle with the other young people of the country and bring with them into the affairs of the world nothing upon which they can pride themselves except that they are white men and are not obliged to work for a living This false pride has infected the whole mass of the white population and the young man whose father has half a dozen children and an equal number of slaves looks with affected disdain upon the son of his father's neighbour who owns no slaves because the son of the non-slaveholder must work for his bread whilst the son of the master of half a dozen negroes contrives to support himself in a sort of lazy poverty only one remove from actual penury Every man who is able to procure a subsistence without labour regards himself a gentleman from this circumstance alone if he has nothing else to sustain his pretensions These poor gentlemen are the worst members of society and the least productive of benefit either to themselves or their country They are prone to horse-racing cock-fighting gambling and all sorts of vices common to the country Having no livelihood and being engaged in no pursuit they hope to distinguish themselves by running to excess in what they call fashionable amusements or sporting exercises These people are universally detested by the slaves and are indeed far more tyrannical than the great slave-holders themselves or any other portion of the white population the overseers excepted A man who is master of only four or five slaves is generally the most ready of all to apprehend a black man whom he may happen to catch straying from his plantation and generally whips him the most unmercifully for this offence The law gives him the same authority to arrest the person of a slave seen travelling without his pass that it vests in the owner of five hundred negroes and the experience of all ages that petty tyrants are the most oppressive seems fully verified in the cotton country A person who has not been in the slave-holding states can never fully understand the bonds that hold society together there or appreciate the rules which prescribe the boundaries of the pretensions of the several orders of men who compose the body politic of those communities and after all that I have written and all that I shall write in this book the reader who has never resided south of the Potomac will never be able to perceive things precisely as they present themselves to my vision or to comprehend the spirit that prevails in a country where the population is divided into three separate classes Those will fall into great error who shall imagine that in Carolina and Georgia there are but two orders of men and that the artificial distinctions of society have only classified the people into white and black freemen and slaves It is true that the distinctions of colour are the most obvious and present themselves more readily than any others to the inspection of a stranger but he who will take time to examine into the fundamental organization of society in the cotton planting region will easily discover that there is a third order of men located there little known to the world but who nevertheless hold a separate station occupying a place of their own and who do not come into direct contrast with either the master or the slave The white man who has no property no possession and no education is in Carolina in a condition no better than that to which the slave has been reduced except only that he is master of his own person and of his own time and may if he chooses emigrate and transfer himself to a country where he can better his circumstances whilst the slave is bound by invisible chains to the plantation on which his master may think proper to place him In my opinion there is no order of men in any part of the United States with which I have any acquaintance who are in a more debased and humiliated state of moral servitude than are those white people who inhabit that part of the southern country where the landed property is all or nearly all held by the great planters Many of these white people live in wretched cabins not half so good as the houses which judicious planters provide for their slaves Some of these cabins of the white men are made of mere sticks or small poles notched or rather thatched together and filled in with mud mixed with the leaves or shats as they are termed of the pine tree Some fix their residence far in the pine forest and gain a scanty subsistence by notching the trees and gathering the turpentine others are seated upon some poor and worthless point of land near the margin of a river or creek and draw a precarious livelihood from the water and the badly cultivated garden that surrounds or adjoins the dwelling These people do not occupy the place held in the north by the respectable and useful class of day labourers who constitute so considerable a portion of the numerical population of the country In the south these white cottagers are never employed to work on the plantations for wages Two things forbid this The white man however poor and necessitous he may be is too proud to go to work in the same field with the negro slaves by his side and the owner of the slaves is not willing to permit white men of the lowest order to come amongst them lest the morals of the negroes should be corrupted and illicit traffic should be carried on to the detriment of the master The slaves generally believe that however miserable they may be in their servile station it is nevertheless preferable to the degraded existence of these poor white people This sentiment is cherished by the slaves and encouraged by their masters who fancy that they subserve their own interests in promoting an opinion amongst the negroes that they are better off in the world than are many white persons who are free and have to submit to the burthen of taking care of and providing for themselves I never could learn nor understand how or by what means these poor cottagers came to be settled in Carolina They are a separate and distinct race of men from the planters and appear to have nothing in common with them If it were possible for any people to occupy a grade in human society below that of the slaves on the cotton plantations certainly the station would be filled by these white families who cannot be to possess any thing in the shape of property The contempt in which they are held and the contumely with which they are treated by the great planters to be comprehended must be seen These observations are applicable in their fullest extent only to the lower parts of Georgia and Carolina and to country places In the upper country where slaves are not so numerous and where less of cotton and more of grain is cultivated there is not so great a difference between the white man who holds slaves and a plantation and another white man who has neither slaves nor plantation In the towns also more especially in Charleston and Savannah where the number of white men who have no slaves is very great they are able from their very numbers to constitute a moral force sufficiently powerful to give them some degree of weight in the community I shall now return to my narrative Early in March or perhaps on one of the last days of February my seine being now completed my master told me I must take with me three other black men and go to the river to clear out a fishery This task of clearing out a fishery was a very disagreeable job for it was nothing less than dragging out of the river all the old trees and brush that had sunk to the bottom within the limits of our intended fishing ground My master's eldest son had been down the river and had purchased two boats to be used at the fishery but when I saw them I declared them to be totally unfit for the purpose They were old batteaux and so leaky that they would not have supported the weight of a wet seine and the men necessary to lay it out I advised the building of two good canoes from some of the large yellow pines in the woods My advice was accepted and together with five other hands I went to work at the canoes which we completed in less than a week So far things went pretty well and I flattered myself that I should become the head man at this new fishery and have the command of the other hands I also expected that I should be able to gain some advantage to myself by disposing of a part of the small fish that might be taken at the fishery I reckoned without my host My master had only purchased this place a short time before he bought me Before that time he did not own any place on the river fit for the establishment of a fishery His lands adjoined the river for more than a mile in extent along its margin but an impassable morass separated the channel of the river from the firm ground all along his lines He had cleared the highest parts of this morass or swamp and had here made his rice fields but he was as entirely cut off from the river as if an ocean had separated it from him On the day that we launched the canoes into the river and while we were engaged in removing some snags and old trees that had stuck in the mud near the shore an ill-looking stranger came to us and told us that our master had sent him to take charge of the fishery and superintend all the work that was to be done at it This man by his contract with my master was to receive a part of all the fish caught in lieu of wages and was invested with the same authority over us that was exercised by the overseer in the cotton field I soon found that I had cause to regret my removal from the plantation It was found quite impossible to remove the old logs and other rubbish from the bottom of the river without going into the water and wrenching them from their places with long hand-spikes In performing this work we were obliged to wade up to our shoulders and often to dip our very heads under water in raising the sunken timber However within less than a week we had cleared the ground and now began to haul our seine At first we caught nothing but common river fish but after two or three days we began to take shad Of the common fish such as pike perch suckers and others we had the liberty of keeping as many as we could eat but the misfortune was that we had no pork or fat of any kind to fry them with and for several days we contented ourselves with broiling them on the coals and eating them with our corn bread and sweet potatoes We could have lived well if we had been permitted to broil the shad on the coals and eat them for a fat shad will dress itself in being broiled and is very good without any oily substance added to it All the shad that we caught were carefully taken away by a black man who came three times every day to the fishery with a cart The master of the fishery had a family that lived several miles up the river In the summer time he fished with hooks and small nets when not engaged in running turpentine in the pine woods In the winter he went back into the pine forest and made tar of the dead pine trees but returned to the river at the opening of the spring to take advantage of the shad fishery He was supposed to be one of the most skilful fishermen on the Congaree river and my master employed him to superintend his new fishery under an expectation I presume that as he was to get a tenth part of all the fish that might be caught he would make the most of his situation My master had not calculated with accuracy the force of habit nor the difficulty which men experience in conducting very simple affairs of which they have no practical knowledge The fish-master did very well for the interest of his employer for a few days compelling us to work in hauling the seine night and day and scarcely permitting us to take rest enough to obtain necessary sleep We were compelled to work full sixteen hours every day including Sunday for in the fishing season no respect is paid to Sunday by fishermen anywhere We had our usual quantity of bread and potatoes with plenty of common fish but no shad came to our lot nor had we any thing to fry our fish with A broiled fresh-water fish is not very good at best without salt or oil and after we had eaten them every day for a week we cared very little for them By this time our fish-master began to relax in his discipline not that he became more kind to us or required us to do less work but to compel us to work all night it was necessary for him to sit up all night and watch us This was a degree of toil and privation to which he could not long submit and one evening soon after dark he called me to him and told me that he intended to make me overseer of the fishery that night and he had no doubt I would keep the hands at work and attend to the business as well without him as with him He then went into his cabin and went to bed whilst I went and laid out the seine and made a very good haul We took more than two hundred shad at this draught and followed up our work with great industry all night only taking time to eat our accustomed meal at midnight Every fisherman knows that the night is the best time for taking shad and the little rest that had been allowed us since we began to fish had always been from eight o'clock in the morning until four in the afternoon unless within that period there was an appearance of a school of fish in the river when we had to rise and lay out the seine no matter at what hour of the day The fish-master had been very severe with the hands since he came amongst us and had made very free use of a long hickory gad that he sometimes carried about with him though at times he would relax his austerity and talk quite familiarly with us especially with me whom he perceived to have some knowledge of the business in which we were engaged The truth was that this man knew nothing of fishing with a seine and I had been obliged from the beginning to direct the operations of laying out and drawing in the seine though the master was always very loud and boisterous in giving his commands and directing us in what part of the river we should let down the seine Having never been accustomed to regular work or to the pursuit of any constant course of personal application the master was incapable of long continued exertion and I feel certain that he could not have been prevailed upon to labour twelve hours each day for a year if in return he had been certain of receiving ten thousand dollars Notwithstanding this he was capable of rousing himself and of undergoing any degree of fatigue or privation for a short time even for a few days He had not been trained to habits of industry and could not bear the restraints of uniform labour We worked hard all night the first night of my superintendence and when the sun rose the next morning the master had not risen from his bed As it was now the usual time of dividing the fish I called to him to come and see this business fairly done but as he did not come down immediately to the landing I proceeded to make the division myself in as equitable a manner as I could giving however a full share of large fish to the master When he came down to us and overlooked both the piles of fish-- his own and that of my master--he was so well satisfied with what I had done that he if he had known that I would do so well for him he would not have risen I was glad to hear this as it led me to hope that I should be able to induce him to stay in his cabin during the greater part of the time to do which I was well assured he felt disposed When the night came the master again told me he should go to bed not being well and desired me to do as I had done the night before This night we cooked as many shad as we could all eat but were careful to carry far out into the river the scale and entrails of the stolen fish In the morning I made a division of the fish before I called the master and then went and asked him to come and see what I had done He was again well pleased and now proposed to us all that if we would not let the affair be known to our master he would leave us to manage the fishery at night according to our discretion To this proposal we all readily agreed and I received authority to keep the other hands at work until the master would go and get his breakfast I had now accomplished the object that I had held very near my heart ever since we began to fish at this place From this time to the end of the fishing season we all lived well and did not perform more work than we were able to bear I was in no fear of being punished by the fish-master for he was now a least as much in my power as I was in his for if my master had known the agreement that he had made with us for the purpose of enabling himself to sleep all night in his cabin he would have been deprived of his situation and all the profits of his share of the fishery There never can be any affinity of feeling between master and slave except in some few isolated cases where the master has treated his slave in such a manner as to have excited in him strong feelings of gratitude or where the slave entertains apprehensions that by the death of his master or by being separated from him in any other way he may fall under the power of a more tyrannical ruler or may in some shape be worsted by the change I was never acquainted with a slave who believed that he violated any rule of morality by appropriating to himself any thing that belonged to his master if it was necessary to his comfort The master might call it theft and brand it with the name of crime but the slave reasoned differently when he took a portion of his master's goods to satisfy his hunger keep himself warm or to gratify his passion for luxurious enjoyment The slave sees his master residing in a spacious mansion riding in a fine carriage and dressed in costly clothes and attributes the possession of all these enjoyments to his own labour whilst he who is the cause of so much gratification and pleasure to another is himself deprived of even the necessary accommodations of human life Ignorant men do not and cannot reason logically and in tracing things from cause to effect the slave attributes all that he sees in possession of his master to his own toil without taking the trouble to examine how far the skill judgment and economy of his master may have contributed to the accumulation of the wealth by which his residence is surrounded There is in fact a mutual dependence between the master and his slave The former could not acquire any thing without the labour of the latter and the latter would always remain in poverty without the former in directing labour to a definite and profitable result After I had obtained the virtual command of the fishery I was careful to awaken the master every morning at sunrise that he might be present when the division of the fish was made and when the morning cart arrived that the carter might not report to my master that the fish-master was in bed I had now become interested in preserving the good opinion of my master in favour of his agent Since my arrival in Carolina I had never enjoyed a full meal of bacon and now determined if possible to procure such a supply of that luxury as would enable me and all my fellow-slaves at the fishery to regale ourselves at pleasure At this season of the year boats frequently passed up the river laden with merchandise and goods of various kinds amongst which were generally large quantities of salt intended for curing fish and for other purposes on the plantations These boats also carried bacon and salted pork up the river for sale but they never moved at night confining their navigation to daylight and as none of them had hitherto stopped near our landing we had not met with an opportunity of entering into a traffic with any of the boat masters We were not always to be so unfortunate One evening in the second week of the fishing season a large keel-boat was seen working up the river about sundown and shortly after came to for the night on the opposite side of the river directly against our landing We had at the fishery a small canoe called a punt about twelve feet long and when we went to lay out the seine for the first haul after night I attached the punt to the side of the canoe and when we had finished letting down the seine I left the other hands to work it toward the shore and ran over in the punt to the keel-boat Upon inquiring of the captain if he had any bacon that he would exchange for shad he he had a little but as the risk he would run in dealing with a slave was great I must expect to pay him more than the usual price He at length proposed to give me a hundred pounds of bacon for three hundred shad This was at least twice as much as the bacon was worth but we did not bargain as men generally do where half of the bargain is on each side for here the captain of the keel-boat settled the terms for both parties However he ran the hazard of being prosecuted for dealing with slaves which is a very high offence in Carolina and I was selling that which in point of law did not belong to me but to which nevertheless I felt in my conscience that I had a better right than any other person In support of the right which I felt to be on my side in this case came a keen appetite for the bacon which settled the controversy upon the question of the morality of this traffic in my favour It so happened that we made a good haul with our seine this evening and at the time I returned to the landing the men were all on shore engaged in drawing in the seine As soon as we had taken out the fish we placed three hundred of them in one of our canoes and pushed over to the keel-boat where the fish were counted out and the bacon was received into our craft with all possible despatch One part of this small trade exhibited a trait of human character which I think worthy of being noticed The captain of the boat was a middle-aged thin sallow man with long bushy hair and he looked like one who valued the opinions of men but little I expected that he would not be scrupulous in giving me my full hundred pound of bacon but in this I was mistaken for he weighed the flitches with great exactness in a pair of large steelyards and gave me good weight When the business was ended and the bacon in my canoe he told me he hoped I was satisfied with him and assured me that I should find the bacon excellent When I was about pushing from the boat he told me in a low voice though there was no one who could hear us except his own people--that he should be down the river again in about two weeks when he should be very glad to buy any produce that I had for sale adding I will give you half as much for cotton as it is worth in Charleston and pay you either in money or groceries as you may choose Take care and do not betray yourself and I shall be honest with you I was so much rejoiced at being in possession of a hundred pounds of good flitch bacon that I had no room in either my head or my heart for the consideration of this man's notions of honesty at the present time but paddled with all strength for our landing where we took the bacon from the canoe stowed it away in an old salt barrel and safely deposited it in a hole dug for the purpose in the floor of my cabin About this time our allowance of sweet potatoes was withheld from us altogether in consequence of the high price paid for this article by the captains of the keel-boats for the purpose as I heard of sending them to New-York and Philadelphia Ever since Christmas we had been permitted to draw on each Sunday evening either a peck of corn as usual or half a peck of corn and half a bushel of sweet potatoes at our discretion The half a peck of corn and the half a bushel of potatoes was worth much more than a peck of corn but potatoes were so abundant this year that they were of little value and the saving of corn was an object worth attending to by a large planter The boatmen now offered half a dollar a bushel for potatoes and we were again restricted to our corn ration Notwithstanding the privation of our potatoes we at the fishery lived sumptuously although our master certainly believed that our fare consisted of corn bread and river fish cooked without lard or butter It was necessary to be exceedingly cautious in the use of our bacon and to prevent the suspicions of the master and others who frequented our landing I enjoined our people never to fry any of the meat but to boil it all No one can smell boiled bacon far but fried flitch can be smelled a mile by a good nose We had two meals every night one of bacon and the other of fried shad which nearly deprived us of all appetite for the breakfasts and dinners that we prepared in the daytime consisting of cold corn bread without salt and broiled fresh water fish without any sort of seasoning We spent more than two weeks in this happy mode of life unmolested by our master his son or the master of the fishery when the latter complained rather than threatened us because we sometimes suffered our seine to float too far down the river and get entangled amongst some roots and brush that lay on the bottom immediately below our fishing ground We now expected every evening to see the return of the boatman who had sold us the bacon and the man who was with me in the canoe at the time we received it had not forgotten the invitation of the captain to trade with him in cotton on his return My fellow-slave was a native of Virginia as he told me and had been sold and brought to Carolina about ten years before this time He was a good natured kind hearted man and did many acts of benevolence to me such as one slave is able to perform for another and I felt a real affection for him but he had adopted the too common rule of moral action that there is no harm in a slave robbing his master The reader may suppose from my account of the bacon that I too had adopted this rule as a part of my creed but I solemnly declare that this was not the case and that I never deprived any one of all the masters that I have served of any thing against his consent unless it was some kind of food and that of all I ever took I am confident I have given away more than the half to my fellow-slaves whom I knew to be equally needy with myself The man who had been with me at the keelboat told me one day that he had laid a plan by which we could get thirty or forty dollars if I would join him in the execution of his project Thirty or forty dollars was a large sum of money to me I had never possessed so much money at one time in my life and I told him that I was willing to do any thing by which we could obtain such a treasure He then told me that he knew where the mule and cart that were used by the man who carried away our fish were kept at night and that he intended to set out on the first dark night and go to the plantation--harness the mule to the cart--go to the cotton-gin house--put two bags of cotton into the cart--bring them to a thicket of small pines that grew on the river bank a short distance below the fishery and leave them there until the keel-boat should return All that he desired of me was to make some excuse for his absence to the other hands and assist him to get his cotton into the canoe at the coming of the boat I disliked the whole scheme both on account of its iniquity and of the danger which attended it but my companion was not to be discouraged by all the arguments which I could use against it and if I would not participate in it he was determined to undertake it alone provided I would not inform against him To this I nothing but he had so often heard me express my detestation of one slave betraying another that I presume he felt easy on that score The next night but one after this conversation was very dark and when we went to lay out the seine after night Nero was missing The other people inquired of me if I knew where he was and when I replied in the negative little more was on the subject it being common for the slaves to absent themselves from habitations at night and if the matter is not discovered by the overseer or master nothing is ever of it by the slaves The other people supposed that in this instance Nero had gone to see a woman whom he lived with as his wife on a plantation a few miles down the river and were willing to work a little harder to permit him to enjoy the pleasure of seeing his family He returned before day and he had been to see his wife which satisfied the curiosity of our companions The very next evening after Nero's absence the keel-boat descended the river came down on our side hailed us at the fishery and drawing in to the shore below our landing made her ropes fast among the young pines of which I have spoken above After we made our first haul I missed Nero but he returned to us before we had laid out the seine and told us that he had been in the woods to collect some light-wood-- dry resinous pine--which he brought on his shoulder When the morning came the keel-boat was gone and every thing wore the ordinary aspect about our fishery but when the man came with the mule and the cart to take away the fish he told us that there was great trouble on the plantation The overseer had discovered that some one had stolen two bags of cotton the last night and all the hands were undergoing an examination on the subject The slaves on the plantation one and all denied having any knowledge of the matter and as there was no evidence against any one the overseer threatened at the time he left the quarter to whip every hand on the estate for the purpose of making them discover who the thief was The slaves on the plantation differed in opinion as to the perpetrator of this theft but the greater number concurred in charging it upon a free negro man named Ishmael who lived in a place called the White Oak Woods and followed making ploughs and harrow frames He also made handles for hoes and the frame work of cart bodies This man was generally reputed a thief for a great distance round the country and the black people charged him with stealing the cotton on no other evidence than his general bad character The overseer on the other hand expressed his opinion without hesitation which was that the cotton had been stolen by some of the people of the plantation and sold to a poor white man who resided at the distance of three miles back in the pine woods and was believed to have dealt with slaves as a receiver of their stolen goods for many years This white man was one of the class of poor cottagers to whom I have heretofore referred in this narrative The house or cabin in which he resided was built of small poles of the yellow pine with the bark remaining on them the roof was of clap-boards of pine and the chimney was made of sticks and mud raised to the height of eight or ten feet The appearance of the man and his wife was such as one might expect to find in such a dwelling The lowest poverty had through life been the companion of these poor people of which their clayey complexions haggard figures and tattered garments gave the strongest proof It appeared to me that the state of destitution in which these people lived afforded very convincing evidence that they were not in possession of the proceeds of the stolen goods of any person I had often been at the cabin of this man in my trapping expeditions the previous autumn and winter and I believe the overseer regarded the circumstance that black people often called at his house as conclusive evidence that he held criminal intercourse with them However this might be the overseer determined to search the premises of this harmless forester whom he resolved beforehand to treat as a guilty man It being known that I was well acquainted with the woods in the neighbourhood of the cabin I was sent for to leave the fishery and come to assist in making search for the lost bags of cotton--perhaps it was also believed that I was in the secrets of the suspected house It was not thought prudent to trust any of the hands on the plantation in making the intended search as they were considered the principal thieves whilst we of the fishery against whom no suspicion had arisen were required to give our assistance in ferreting out the perpetrators of an offence of the highest grade that can be committed by a slave on a cotton estate Before leaving the fishery I advised the master to be very careful not to let the overseer or my master know that he had left us to manage the fishery at night by ourselves since as a theft had been committed it might possibly be charged upon him if it were known that he had allowed us so much liberty I this to put the master on his guard against surprise and to prevent him from saying any thing that might turn the attention of the overseer to the hands at the fishery for I knew that if punishment were to fall amongst us it would be quite as likely to reach the innocent as the guilty--besides though I was innocent of the bags of cotton I was guilty of the bacon and however I might make distinctions between the moral turpitude of the two cases I knew that if discovered they would both be treated alike When I arrived at the quarter whither I repaired in obedience to the orders I received I found the overseer with my master's eldest son and a young white man who had been employed to repair the cotton-gin waiting for me I observed when I came near the overseer that he looked at me very attentively and afterwards called my young master aside and spoke to him in a tone of voice too low to be heard by me The white gentlemen then mounted their horses and set off by the road for the cabin of the white man I had orders to take a short route through the woods and across a swamp by which I could reach the cabin as soon as the overseer The attentive examination that the overseer had given me caused me to feel uneasy although I could not divine the cause of his scrutiny nor of the subject of the short conversation between him and my young master By travelling at a rapid pace I arrived at the cabin of the suspected man before the gentlemen but thought it prudent not to approach it before they came up lest it might be imagined that I had gone in to give information to the occupants of the danger that threatened them Here I had a hard struggle with my conscience which seemed to say to me that I ought at once to disclose all I knew concerning the lost bags of cotton for the purpose of saving these poor people from the terror that they must necessarily feel at the sight of those who were coming to accuse them of a great crime perhaps from the afflictions and sufferings attendant upon a prosecution in a court of justice These reflections were cut short by the arrival of the party of gentlemen who passed me where I sat at the side of the path with no other notice than a simple command of the overseer to come on I followed them into the cabin where we found the man and his wife with two little children eating roasted potatoes The overseer saluted this family by telling them that we had come to search the house for stolen cotton That it was well known that he had long been dealing with negroes and they were now determined to bring him to punishment I was then ordered to tear up the floor of the cabin whilst the overseer mounted into the loft I found nothing under the floor and the overseer had no better success above The wife was then advised to confess where her husband had concealed the cotton to save herself from being brought in as a party to the affair but this poor woman protested with tears that they were totally ignorant of the whole matter Whilst the wife was interrogated the father stood without his own door trembling with fear but as I could perceive indignant with rage The overseer who was fluent in the use of profane language exerted the highest degree of his vulgar eloquence upon these harmless people whose only crime was their poverty and whose weakness alone had invited the ruthless aggression of their powerful and rich neighbours Finding nothing in the house the gentlemen set out to scour the woods around the cabin and commanded me to take the lead in tracing out tree tops and thickets where it was most likely that the stolen cotton might be found Our search was in vain as I knew it would be beforehand but when weary of ranging in the woods the gentlemen again returned to the cabin which we now found without inhabitants The alarm caused by our visit and the manner in which the gentlemen had treated this lonely family had caused them to abandon their dwelling and seek safety in flight The door of the house was closed and fastened with a string to a nail in the post of the door After calling several times for the fugitives and receiving no answer the door was kicked open by my young master the few articles of miserable furniture that the cabin contained including a bed made of flags were thrown into a heap in the corner and fire was set to the dwelling by the overseer We remained until the flames had reached the roof of the cabin when the gentlemen mounted their horses and set off for home ordering me to return by the way that I had come When we again reached the house of my master several gentlemen of the neighbourhood had assembled drawn together by common interest that is felt amongst the planters to punish theft and particularly a theft of cotton in the bag My young master related to his neighbours with great apparent satisfaction the exploits of the morning he had routed one receiver of stolen goods out of the country and that all others of his character ought to be dealt with in the same manner In this opinion all the gentlemen present concurred and after much conversation on the subject it was agreed to call a general meeting for the purpose of devising the best surest and most peaceful method of removing from the country the many white men who residing in the district without property or without interest in preserving the morals of the slaves were believed to carry on an unlawful and criminal traffic with the negroes to the great injury of the planters in general and of the masters of the slaves who dealt with the offenders in particular I was present at this preliminary consultation which took place at my master's cotton-gin whither the gentlemen had repaired for the purpose of looking at the place where the cotton had been removed So many cases of this forbidden traffic between the slaves and these white negro dealers as they were termed were here related by the different gentlemen and so many white men were referred to by name as being concerned in this criminal business that I began to suppose the losses of the planters in this way must be immense This conference continued until I had totally forgotten the scrutinizing look that I had received from our overseer at the time I came up from the fishery in the morning but the period had now come when I again was to be reminded of this circumstance for on a sudden the overseer called me to come forward and let the gentlemen see me I again felt a sort of vague and undefinable apprehension that no good was to grow out of this examination of my person but a command of our overseer was not to be disobeyed After looking at my face with a kind of leer or side glance one of the gentlemen who was an entire stranger to me and whom I had never before seen boy you appear to live well how much meat does your master allow you in a week I was almost totally confounded at the name of meat and felt the blood rush to my heart but nevertheless forced a sort of smile upon my face and replied My master has been very kind to all his people of late but has not allowed us any meat for some weeks We have plenty of good bread and abundance of river fish which together with the heads and roes of the shad that we have salted at the landing makes a very excellent living for us though if master would please to give us a little meat now and then we should be very thankful for it This speech which contained all the eloquence I was master of at the time seemed to produce some effect in my favour for the gentleman nothing in reply until the overseer rising from a board on which he had been sitting came close up to me and Charles you need not tell lies about it you have been eating meat I know you have no negro could look as fat and sleek and black and greasy as you if he had nothing to eat but corn bread and river chubs You do not look at all as you did before you went to the fishery and all the hands on the plantation have had as many chubs and other river fish as they could eat as well as you and yet they are as poor as snakes in comparison with you Come tell us the truth let us know where you get the meat that you have been eating and you shall not be whipped I begged the overseer and the other gentlemen not to ridicule or make sport of me because I was a poor slave and was obliged to live on bread and fresh water fish and concluded this second harangue by expressing my thankfulness to God Almighty for giving me such good health and strength as to enable me to do my work and look so well as I did upon such poor fare adding that if I only had as much bacon as I could eat they would soon see a man of a different appearance from that which I now exhibited None of your palaver rejoined the overseer--Why I smell the meat in you this moment Do I not see the grease as it runs out of your face I was by this time in a profuse sweat caused by the anxiety of my feelings and simply Master sees me sweat I suppose All the gentlemen present then declared with one accord that I must have been living on meat for a long time as no negro who had no meat to eat could look as I did and one of the company advised the overseer to whip me and compel me to confess the truth I have no doubt but this advice would have been practically followed had it not been for a happy though dangerous suggestion of my own mind at this moment It was no other than a proposal on my part that I should be taken to the landing and if all the people there did not look as well and as much like meat-eaters as I did then I would agree to be whipped in any way the gentlemen should deem expedient This offer on my part was instantly accepted by the gentlemen and it was agreed amongst them that they would all go to the landing with the overseer partly for the purpose of seeing me condemned by the judgment to which I had voluntarily chosen to submit myself and partly for the purpose of seeing my master's new fishery We were quickly at the landing though four miles distant and I now felt confident that I should escape the dangers that beset me provided the master of the fishery did not betray his own negligence and lead himself as well as us into new troubles Though on foot I was at the landing as soon as the gentlemen and was first to announce to the master the feats we had performed in the course of the day adding with great emphasis and even confidence in my manner You know master fish-master whether we have had any meat to eat here or not If we had meat here would not you see it You have been up with us every night and know that we have not been allowed to take even shad let alone having meat to eat The fish-master supported me in all I declared we had been good boys--had worked night and day of his certain knowledge as he had been with us all night and every night since we began to fish That he had not allowed us to eat any thing but fresh water fish and the heads and roes of the shad that were salted at the landing As to meat he he was willing to be qualified on a cart load of testaments that there had not been a pound at the landing since the commencement of the season except that which he had in his own cabin I had now acquired confidence and desired the gentlemen to look at Nero and the other hands all of whom had as much the appearance of bacon eaters as myself This was the truth especially with regard to one of the men who was much fatter than I was The gentlemen now began to doubt the evidence of their own senses which they had held infallible heretofore I showed the fine fish that we had to eat cat perch mullets and especially two large pikes that had been caught to-day and assured them that upon such fare as this men must needs get fat I now perceived that victory was with me for once All the gentlemen faltered hesitated and began to talk of other affairs except the overseer who still ran about the landing swearing and scratching his head and saying it was strange that we were so fat whilst the hands on the plantation were as lean as sand-hill cranes He was obliged to give the affair over He was no longer supported by my young master and his companions all of whom congratulated themselves upon a discovery so useful and valuable to the planting interest and all determined to provide as soon as possible a proper supply of fresh river fish for their hands The two bales of cotton were never once named and I suppose were not thought of by the gentlemen when at the landing and this was well for Nero for such was the consternation and terror into which he was thrown by the presence of the gentlemen and their inquiries concerning our eating of meat that the sweat rolled off him like rain from the plant never-wet his countenance was wild and haggard and his knees shook like the wooden spring of a wheat-fan I believe that if they had charged him at once with stealing the cotton he would have confessed the deed XVI After this the fishing season passed off without any thing having happened worthy of being noticed here When we left the fishery and returned to the plantation which was after the middle of April the corn and cotton had all been planted and the latter had been replanted I was set to plough with two mules for my team and having never been accustomed to ploughing with these animals I had much trouble with them at first My master owned more than forty mules and at this season of the year they were all at work in the cotton field used instead of horses for drawing ploughs Some of the largest were hitched single to a plough but the smallest were coupled together On the whole the fishery had been a losing affair with me for although I had lived better at the landing than I usually did at the plantation yet I had been compelled to work all the time by night and by day including Sunday for my master by which I had lost all that I could have earned for my own benefit had I been on the plantation I had now become so well acquainted with the rules of the plantation and the customs of the country where I lived that I experienced less distress than I did at my first coming to the south We now received a shad every Sunday evening with our peck of corn The fish were those that I had caught in the spring and were tolerably preserved In addition to all this each one of the hands now received a pint of vinegar every week This vinegar was a great comfort to me As the weather became hot I gathered lettuce and other salads from my garden in the woods which with the vinegar and bread furnished me many a cheerful meal The vinegar had been furnished to us by our master more out of regard to our health than to our comfort but it greatly promoted both The affairs of the plantation now went on quietly until after the cotton had been ploughed and hoed the first time after replanting The working of the cotton crop is not disagreeable labour--no more so than the culture of corn--but we were called upon to perform a kind of labour than which none can be more toilsome to the body or dangerous to the health I have elsewhere informed the reader that my master was a cultivator of rice as well as of cotton Whilst I was at the fishery in the spring thirty acres of swamp land had been cleared off ploughed and planted in rice The water had now been turned off the plants and the field was to be ploughed and hoed When we were taken to the rice field the weather was very hot and the ground was yet muddy and wet The ploughs were to be dragged through the wet soil and the young rice had to be cleaned of weeds by the hand and hilled up with the hoe It is the common opinion that no stranger can work a week in a rice swamp at this season of the year without becoming sick and all the new hands three in number besides myself were taken ill within the first five days after we had entered this field The other three were removed to the sick room but I did not go there choosing rather to remain at the quarter where I was my own master except that the doctor who called to see me took a large quantity of blood from my arm and compelled pelted me to take a dose of some sort of medicine that made me very sick and caused me to vomit violently This happened on the second day of my illness and from this time I recovered slowly but was not able to go to the field again for more than a week Here it is but justice to my master to say that during all the time of my illness some one came from the great house every day to inquire after me and to offer me some kind of light and cool refreshment I might have gone to the sick room at any time if I had chosen to do so An opinion generally prevails amongst the people of both colours that the drug copperas is very poisonous--and perhaps it may be so if taken in large quantities--but the circumstance that it is used in medicine seems to forbid the notion of its poisonous qualities I believe copperas was mingled with the potion the doctor gave to me Some overseers keep copperas by them as a medicine to be administered to the hands whenever they become sick but this I take to be a bad practice for although in some cases this drug may be very efficacious it certainly should be administered by a more skilful hand than that of an overseer It however has the effect of deterring the people from complaining of illness until they are no longer able to work for it is the most nauseous and sickening medicine that was ever taken into the stomach Ignorant or malicious overseers may and often do misapply it as was the case with our overseer when he compelled poor Lydia to take a draught of its solution After the restoration of my health I resumed my accustomed labour in the field and continued it without intermission until I left this plantation We had this year as a part of our crop ten acres of indigo This plant is worked nearly after the manner of rice except that it is planted on high and dry ground whilst the rice is always cultivated in low swamps where the ground may be inundated with water but notwithstanding its location on dry ground the culture of indigo is not less unpleasant than that of rice When the rice is ripe and ready for the sickle it is no longer disagreeable but when the indigo is ripe and ready to cut the troubles attendant upon it have only commenced The indigo plant bears more resemblance to the weed called wild indigo which is common in the woods of Pennsylvania than to any other herb with which I am acquainted The root of the indigo plant is long and slender and emits a scent somewhat like that of parsley From the root issues a single stem straight hard and slender covered with a bark a little cracked on its surface of a gray colour towards the bottom green in the middle reddish at the extremity and without the appearance of pith in the inside The leaves ranged in pairs around the stalk are of an oval form--smooth soft to the touch furrowed above and of a deep green on the under side The upper parts of the plant are loaded with small flowers destitute of smell Each flower changes into a pod enclosing seed This plant thrives best in a rich moist soil The seeds are black very small and sowed in straight drills This crop requires very careful culture and must be kept free from every kind of weeds and grass It ripens within less than three months from the time it is sown When it begins to flower the top is cut off and as new flowers appear the plant is again pruned until the end of the season Indigo impoverishes land more rapidly than almost any other crop and the plant must be gathered in with great caution for fear of shaking off the valuable farina that lies in the leaves When gathered it is thrown into the steeping vat--a large tub filled with water--here it undergoes a fermentation which in twenty-four hours at farthest is completed A cock is then turned to let the water run into the second tub called the mortar or pounding tub the steeping vat is then cleaned out that fresh plants may be thrown in and thus the work is continued without interruption The water in the pounding tub is stirred with wooden buckets with holes in their bottoms for several days and after the sediment contained in the water has settled to the bottom of the tub the water is let off and the sediment which is the indigo of commerce is gathered into bags and hung up to drain It is afterwards pressed and laid away to dry in cakes and then packed in chests for market Washing at the tubs is exceedingly unpleasant both on account of the filth and the stench arising from the decomposition of the plants In the early part of June our shad that each one had been used to receive was withheld from us and we no longer received any thing but the peck of corn and pint of vinegar This circumstance in a community less severely disciplined than ours might have procured murmurs but to us it was only announced by the fact of the fish not being distributed to us on Sunday evening This was considered a fortunate season by our people There had been no exemplary punishment inflicted amongst us for several months we had escaped entirely upon the occasion of the stolen bags of cotton though nothing less was to have been looked for on that occurrence than a general whipping of the whole gang There was more or less of whipping amongst us every week frequently one was flogged every evening over and above the punishments that followed on each settlement day but these chastisements which seldom exceeded ten or twenty lashes were of little import I was careful for my own part to conform to all the regulations of the plantation When I no longer received my fish from the overseer I found it necessary again to resort to my own expedients for the purpose of procuring something in the shape of animal food to add to my bread and greens I had by this time become well acquainted with the woods and swamps for several miles round our plantation and this being the season when the turtles came upon the land to deposite their eggs I availed myself of it and going out one Sunday morning caught in the course of the day by travelling cautiously around the edges of the swamps ten snapping turtles four of which were very large As I caught these creatures I tied each one with hickory bark and hung it up to the bough of a tree so that I could come and carry it home at my leisure I afterwards carried my turtles home and put them into a hole that I dug in the ground four or five feet deep and secured the sides by driving small pieces of split timber into the ground quite round the circumference of the hole the upper ends of the timber standing out above the ground Into this hole I poured water at pleasure and kept my turtles until I needed them On the next Sunday I again went to the swamps to search for turtles but as the period of laying their eggs had nearly passed I had poor success to day only taking two turtles of the species called skill-pots-- a kind of large terrapin with a speckled back and red belly This day when I was three or four miles from home in a very solitary part of the swamps I heard the sound of bells similar to those which wagoners place on the shoulders of their horses At first the noise of bells of this kind in a place where they were so unexpected alarmed me as I could not imagine who or what it was that was causing these bells to ring I was standing near a pond of water and listening attentively I thought the bells were moving in the woods and coming toward me I therefore crouched down upon the ground under cover of a cluster of small bushes that were near me and lay not free from disquietude to await the near approach of these mysterious bells Sometimes they were quite silent for a minute or more at a time and then again would jingle quick but not loud They were evidently approaching me and at length I heard footsteps distinctly in the leaves which lay dry upon the ground A feeling of horror seized me at this moment for I now recollected that I was on the verge of the swamp near which the vultures and carrion crows had mangled the living bodies of the two murderers and my terror was not abated when a moment after I saw come from behind a large tree the form of a brawny famished-looking black man entirely naked with his hair matted and shaggy his eyes wild and rolling and bearing over his head something in the form of an arch elevated three feet above his hair beneath the top of which were suspended the bells three in number whose sound had first attracted my attention Upon a closer examination this frightful figure I perceived that it wore a collar of iron about its neck with a large padlock pendent from behind and carried in its hand a long staff with an iron spear in one end The staff like every thing else belonging to this strange spectre was black It slowly approached within ten paces of me and stood still The sun was now down and the early twilight produced by the gloom of the heavy forest in the midst of which I was added approaching darkness to heighten my dismay My heart was in my mouth all the hairs of my head started from their sockets I seemed to be rising from my hiding place into the open air in spite of myself and I gasped for breath The black apparition moved past me went to the water and kneeled down The forest re-echoed with the sound of the bells and their dreadful peals filled the deepest recesses of the swamps as their bearer drank the water of the pond in which I thought I heard his irons hiss when they came in contact with it I felt confident that I was now in the immediate presence of an inhabitant of a nether fiery world who had been permitted to escape for a time from the place of his torment and come to revisit the scenes of his former crimes I now gave myself up for lost without other aid than my own and began to pray aloud to heaven to protect me At the sound of my voice the supposed evil one appeared to be scarcely less alarmed than I was He sprang to his feet and at a single bound rushed into the water then turning he besought me in a suppliant and piteous tone of voice to have mercy upon him and not carry him back to his master The suddenness with which we pass from the extreme of one passion to the utmost bounds of another is inconceivable and must be assigned to the catalogue of unknown causes and effects unless we suppose the human frame to be an involuntary machine operated upon by surrounding objects which give it different and contrary impulses as a ball is driven to and fro by the batons of boys when they play in troops upon a common I had no sooner heard a human voice than all my fears fled as a spark that ascends from a heap of burning charcoal and vanishes to nothing I at once perceived that the object that had well nigh deprived me of my reason so far from having either the will or the power to injure me was only a poor destitute African negro still more wretched and helpless than myself Rising from the bushes I now advanced to the water side and desired him to come out without fear and to be assured that if I could render him any assistance I would do it most cheerfully As to carrying him back to his master I was more ready to ask help to deliver me from my own than to give aid to any one in forcing him back to his We now went to a place in the forest where the ground was for some distance clear of trees and where the light of the sun was yet so strong that every object could be seen My new friend now desired me to look at his back which was seamed and ridged with scars of the whip and the hickory from the pole of his neck to the lower extremity of the spine The natural colour of the skin had disappeared and was succeeded by a streaked and speckled appearance of dusky white and pale flesh colour scarcely any of the original black remaining The skin of this man's back had been again and again cut away by the thong and renewed by the hand of nature until it was grown fast to the flesh and felt hard and turbid He told me his name was Paul that he was a native of Congo in Africa and had been a slave five years that he had left an aged mother a widow at home as also a wife and four children that it had been his misfortune to fall into the hands of a master who was frequently drunk and whose temper was so savage that his chief delight appeared to consist in whipping and torturing his slaves of whom he owned near twenty but through some unaccountable caprice he had contracted a particular dislike against Paul whose life he now declared to me was insupportable He had then been wandering in the woods more than three weeks with no other subsistence than the land tortoises frogs and other reptiles that he had taken in the woods and along the shores of the ponds with the aid of his spear He had not been able to take any of the turtles in the laying season because the noise of his bells frightened them and they always escaped to the water before he could catch them He had found many eggs which he had eaten raw having no fire nor any means of making fire to cook his food He had been afraid to travel much in the middle of the day lest the sound of his bells should be heard by some one who would make his master acquainted with the place of his concealment The only periods when he ventured to go in search of food were early in the morning before people could have time to leave their homes and reach the swamp or late in the evening after those who were in pursuit of him had gone to their dwellings for the night This man spoke our language imperfectly but possessed a sound and vigorous understanding and reasoned with me upon the propriety of destroying a life which was doomed to continual distress He informed me that he had first run away from his master more than two years ago after being whipped with long hickory switches until he fainted That he concealed himself in a swamp at that time ten or fifteen miles from this place for more than six months but was finally betrayed by a woman who he sometimes visited that when taken he was again whipped until he was not able to stand an had a heavy block of wood chained to one foot which he was obliged to drag after him at his daily labour for more than three months when he found an old file with which he cut the irons from his ancle and again escaped to the woods but was retaken within little more than a week after his flight by two men who were looking for their cattle and came upon him in the woods where he was asleep On being returned to his master he was again whipped and then the iron collar that he now wore with the iron rod extending from one shoulder over his head to the other with the bells fastened at the top of the arch were put upon him Of these irons he could not divest himself and wore them constantly from that time to the present I had no instruments with me to enable we to release Paul from his manacles and all I could do for him was to desire him to go with me to the place where I had left my terrapins which I gave to him together with all the eggs that I had found to day I also caused him to lie down and having furnished myself with a flint-stone many of which lay in the sand near the edge of the pond and a handful of dry moss I succeeded in striking fire from the iron collar and made a fire of sticks upon which he could roast the terrapins and the eggs It was now quite dark and I was full two miles from my road with no path to guide me towards home but the small traces made in the woods by the cattle I advised Paul to bear his misfortunes as well as he could until the next Sunday when I would return and bring with me a file and other things necessary to the removal of his fetters I now set out alone to make my way home not without some little feeling of trepidation as I passed along in the dark shade of the pine trees and thought of the terrific deeds that had been done in these woods This was the period of the full moon which now rose and cast her brilliant rays through the tops of the trees that overhung my way and enveloped my path in a gloom more cheerless than the obscurity of total darkness The path I travelled led by sinuosities around the margin of the swamp and finally ended at the extremity of the cart-road terminating at the spot where David and Hardy had been given alive for food to vultures and over this ground I was now obliged to pass unless I chose to turn far to the left through the pathless forest and make my way to the high road near the spot where the lady had been torn from her horse I hated the idea of acknowledging to my own heart that I was a coward and dared not look upon the bones of a murderer at midnight and there was little less of awe attached to the notion of visiting the ground where the ghost of the murdered woman was reported to wander in the moonbeams than in visiting the scene where diabolical crimes had been visited by fiend-like punishment My opinion is that there is no one who is not at times subject to a sensation approaching fear when placed in situations similar to that in which I found myself this night I did not believe that those who had passed the dark line which separates the living from the dead could again return to the earth either for good or for evil but that solemn foreboding of the heart which directs the minds of all men to a contemplation of the just judgment which a superior and unknown power holds in reservation for the deeds of this life filled my soul with a dread conception of the unutterable woes which a righteous and unerring tribunal must award to the blood-stained spirits of the two men whose lives had been closed in such unspeakable torment by the side of the path I was now treading The moon had risen high above the trees and shone with a clear and cloudless light the whole firmament of heaven was radiant with the lustre of a mild and balmy summer evening Save only the droppings of the early dew from the lofty branches of the trees into the water which lay in shallow pools on my right and the light trampling of my own footsteps the stillness of night pervaded the lonely wastes around me But there is a deep melancholy in the sound of the heavy drop as it meets the bosom of the wave in a dense forest at night that revives in the memory the recollection of the days of other years and fills the heart with sadness I was now approaching the unhallowed ground where lay the remains of the remorseless and guilty dead who had gone to their final account reeking in their sins unatoned unblest and unwept Already I saw the bones whitened by the rain and bleached in the sun lying scattered and dispersed a leg here and an arm there whilst a scull with the tinder jaw in its place retaining allits teeth grinned a ghastly laugh with its front full in the beams of the moon which falling into the vacant sockets of the eye-balls reflected a pale shadow from these deserted caverns and played in twinkling lustre upon the bald and skinless forehead In a moment the night-breeze agitated the leaves of the wood and moaned in dreary sighs through the lofty pine tops the gale shook the forest in the depth of its solitudes a cloud swept across the moon and her light disappeared a flock of carrion crows disturbed in their roosts flapped their wings and fluttered over my head and a wolf who had been gnawing the dry bones greeted the darkness with a long and dismal howl I felt the blood chill in my veins and all my joints shuddered as if I had been smitten by electricity At least a minute elapsed before I recovered the power of self-government I hastened to fly from a place devoted to crime where an evil genius presided in darkness over a fell assembly of howling wolves and blood-snuffing vultures When I arrived at the quarter all was quiet The inhabitants of this mock-village were wrapped ill forgetfulness and I stole silently into my little loft and joined my neighbours in their repose Experience had made me so well acquainted with the dangers that beset the life of a slave that I determined as a matter of prudence to say nothing to any one of the adventures of this Sunday but went to work on Monday morning at the summons of the overseer's horn as if nothing unusual had occurred In the course of the week I often thought of the forlorn and desponding African who had so terrified me in the woods and who seemed so grateful for the succour I gave him I felt anxious to become better acquainted with this man who possessed knowledge superior to the common race of slaves and manifested a moral courage in the conversation that I had with him worthy of a better fate than that to which fortune had consigned him On the following Sunday having provided myself with a large file which I procured from the blacksmith shop belonging to the plantation I again repaired to the place at the side of the swamp where I had first seen the figure of this ill-fated man I expected that he would be in waiting for me at the appointed place as I had promised him that I would certainly come again at this time but on arriving at the spot where I had left him I saw no sign of any person The remains of the fire that I had kindled were here and it seemed that the fire had been kept up for several days by the quantity of ashes that lay in a heap surrounded by numerous small brands The impressions of human feet were thickly disposed around this decayed fire and the bones of the terrapins that I had given to Paul as well as the skeletons of many frogs were scattered upon the ground but there was nothing that showed that any one had visited this spot since the fall of the last rain which I now recollected had taken place on the previous Thursday From this circumstance I concluded that Paul had relieved himself of his irons and gone to seek concealment in some other place or that his master had discovered his retreat and carried him back to the plantation Whilst standing at the ashes I heard the croaking of ravens at some distance in the woods and immediately afterwards a turkey-buzzard passed over me pursued by an eagle coming from the quarter in which I had just heard the ravens I knew that the eagle never pursued the buzzard for the purpose of preying upon him but only to compel him to disgorge himself of his own prey for the benefit of the king of birds I therefore concluded that there was some dead animal in my neighbourhood that had called all these ravenous fowls together It might be that Paul had killed a cow by knocking her down with a pine knot and that he had removed his residence to this slaughtered animal Curiosity was aroused in me and I proceeded to examine the woods I had not advanced more than two hundred yards when I felt oppressed by a most sickening stench and saw the trees swarming with birds of prey buzzards perched upon their branches ravens sailing their boughs and clouds of carrion crows flitting about and poising themselves in the air in a stationary position after the manner of that most nauseous of all birds when it perceives or thinks it perceives some object of prey Proceeding onward I came in view of a large sassafras tree around the top of which was congregated a cloud of crows some on the boughs and others on the wing whilst numerous buzzards were sailing low and nearly skimming the ground This sassafras tree had many low horizontal branches attached to one of which I now saw the cause of so vast an assembly of the obscene fowls of the air The lifeless and putrid body of the unhappy Paul hung suspended by a cord made of twisted hickory bark passed in the form of a halter round the neck and firmly bound to a limb of the tree It was manifest that he had climbed the tree fastened the cord to the branch and then sprung off The smell that assailed my nostrils was too overwhelming to permit me to remain long in view of the dead body which was much mangled and torn though its identity was beyond question for the iron collar and the bells with the arch that bore them were still in their place The bells had preserved the corpse from being devoured for whilst I looked at it I observed a crow descend upon it and make a stroke at the face with its beak but the motion that this gave to the bells caused them to rattle and the bird took to flight Seeing that I could no longer render assistance to Paul who was now beyond the reach of his master's tyranny as well as of my pity I returned without delay to my master's house and going into the kitchen related to the household servants that I had found a black man hung in the woods with bells upon him This intelligence was soon communicated to my master who sent for me to come into the house to relate the circumstance to him I was careful not to tell that I had seen Paul before his death and when I had finished my narrative my master observed to a gentleman who was with him that this was a heavy loss to the owner and told me to go The body of Paul was never taken down but remained hanging where I had seen it until the flesh fell from the bones or was torn off by the birds I saw the bones hanging in the sassafras tree more than two months afterwards and the last time that I was ever in these swamps XVII An affair was now in progress which though the persons who were actors in it were far removed from me had in its effects a great influence upon the fortunes of my life I have informed the reader that my master had three daughters and that the second of the sisters was deemed a great beauty The eldest of the three was married about the time of which I now write to a planter of great wealth who resided near Columbia but the second had formed an attachment to a young gentleman whom she had frequently seen at the church attended by my master's family As this young man either from want of wealth or proper persons to introduce him had never been at my master's house my young mistress had no opportunity of communicating to him the sentiments she entertained towards him without violating the rules of modesty in which she had been educated Before she would attempt any thing which might be deemed a violation of the decorum of her sex she determined to take a new method of obtaining a husband She communicated to her father my master a knowledge of the whole affair with a desire that he would invite the gentleman of her choice to his house This the father resolutely opposed upon the ground that the young man upon whom his daughter had fixed her heart was without property and consequently destitute of the means of supporting his daughter in a style suitable to the rank she occupied in society A woman in love is not easily foiled in her purposes my young mistress by continual entreaties so far prevailed over the affections or more probably the fears of her father that he introduced the young man to his family and about two months afterwards my young mistress was a bride but it had been agreed amongst all the parties as I understood before the marriage that as the son-in-law had no land or slaves of his own he should remove with his wife to a large tract of land that my master owned in the new purchase in the state of Georgia In the month of September my master came to the quarter one evening at the time of our return from the field in company with his son-in-law and informed me that he had given me with a number of others of his slaves to his daughter and that I with eight other men and two or three women must set out on the next Sunday with my new master for his estate in Georgia whither we were to go to clear land build houses and make other improvements necessary for the reception of the newly-married lady in the following spring I was much pleased with the appearance and manners of my new master who was a young man apparently about twenty-seven or eight years old and of good figure We were to take with us in our expedition to Georgia a wagon to be drawn by six mules and I was appointed to drive the team Before we set off my young mistress came in person to the quarter and told us that all those who were going to the new settlement must come to the house where she furnished each of us with two full suits of clothes one of coarse woollen and the other of hempen cloth She also gave a hat to each of us and two pairs of shoes with a trifle in money and enjoined us to be good boys and girls and get things ready for her and that when she should come to live with us we should not be forgotten The conduct of this young lady was so different from that which I had been accustomed to witness since I came to Carolina that I considered myself highly fortunate in becoming her slave and now congratulated myself with the idea that I should in future have a mistress who would treat me kindly and if I behaved well would not permit me to want At the time appointed we set out for Georgia with all the tools and implements necessary to the prosecution of a new settlement My young master accompanied us and travelled slowly for several days to enable me to keep up with him We continued our march in this order until we reached the Savannah river at the town of Augusta where my master told me that he was so well satisfied with my conduct that he intended to leave me with the team to bring on the goods and the women and children but that he would take the men and push on as fast as possible to the new settlement and go to work until the time of my arrival He gave me directions to follow on and inquire for Morgan county Court House and that he would have a person ready there on my arrival to guide me to him and the people with him He then gave me twenty dollars to buy food for the mules and provisions for myself and those with me and left me on the high road master of myself and the team I was resolved that this striking proof of confidence on the part of my master should not be a subject of regret to him and pursued my route with the greatest diligence taking care to lay out as little money as possible for such things as I had to buy On the sixth day in the morning I arrived at our new settlement in the middle of a heavy forest of such timber as is common to that country with three dollars and twenty-five cents in my pocket part of the money given to me at Augusta This I offered to return but my master refused to take it and told me to keep it for my good conduct I now felt assured that all my troubles in this world were ended and that in future I might look forward to a life of happiness and ease for I did not consider labour any hardship if I was well provided with good food and clothes and my other wants properly regarded My master and the people who were with him had before our arrival with the wagon put up the logs of two cabins and were engaged when we came in covering one of them with clapboards In the course of the next day we completed both these cabins with puncheon floors and small glass windows the sash and glass for which I had brought in the wagon We put up two other cabins and a stable for the mules and then began to clear land After a few days my master told me he meant to go down into the settlements to buy provisions for the winter and that he should leave me to oversee the hands and carry on the work in his absence He accordingly left us taking with him the wagon and two boys one to drive the team and another to drive cattle and hogs which he intended to buy and drive to our settlement I now felt myself almost proprietor of our new establishment and believe the men left under my charge did not consider me a very lenient overseer I in truth compelled them to work very hard as I did myself At the end of a week my master returned with a heavy load of meal and bacon with salt and other things that we needed and the day following a white man drove to our station several cows and more than twenty hogs the greater part of which were breeders At this season of the year neither the hogs nor the cattle required any feeding at our hands The woods were full of nuts and the grass was abundant but we gave salt to our stock and kept the hogs in a pen two or three days to accustom them to the place We now lived very differently from what we did on my old master's plantation We had as much bacon every day as we could eat which together with bread and sweet potatoes which we had at will constituted our fare My master remained with us more than two months within which time we had cleared forty acres of ground ready for the plough but a few days before Christmas an event took place which in its consequences destroyed all my prospects of happiness and totally changed the future path of my life A messenger one day came to our settlement with a letter which had been forwarded in this manner by the postmaster at the Court House where the post-office was kept This letter contained intelligence of the sudden death of my old master and that difficulties had arisen in the family which required the immediate attention of my young one The letter was written by my mistress My master forthwith took all account of the stock of provisions and other things that he had on hand and putting the whole under my charge gave me directions to attend to the work and set off on horseback that evening promising to return within one month at furthest We never saw him again and heard nothing of him until late in the month of January when the eldest son of my late master came to our settlement in company with a strange gentleman The son of my late master informed me to my surprise and sorrow that my young waster who had brought us to Georgia was dead and that he and the gentleman with him were administrators of the deceased and had come to Georgia for the purpose of letting out on lease for the period of seven years our place with all the people on it including me To me the most distressing part of this news was the death of my young master and I was still more sorry when I learned that he had been killed in a duel My young mistress whose beauty had drawn around her numerous suiters many of whom were men of base minds and cowardly hearts had chosen her husband in the manner I have related and his former rivals after his return from Georgia confederated together for the dastardly purpose of revenging themselves of both husband and wife by the murder of the former In all parts of the cotton country there are numerous taverns which answer the double purpose of drinking and gambling houses These places are kept by men who are willing to abandon all pretensions to the character and standing of gentlemen for the hope of sordid gain and are frequented by all classes of planters though it is not to be understood that all the planters resort to these houses There are men of high and honourable virtue amongst the planters who equally detest the mean cupidity of the men who keep these houses and the silly wickedness of those who support them Billiard is the game regarded as the most polite amongst men of education and fashion but cards dice and every kind of game whether of skill or of hazard are openly played in these sinks of iniquity So far as my knowledge extends there is not a single district of ten miles square in all the cotton region without at least one of these vile ordinaries as they are frequently and justly termed The keeping of these houses is a means of subsistence resorted to by men of desperate reputation or reckless character and they invite as guests all the profligate the drunken the idle and the unwary of the surrounding country In a community where the white man never works except at the expense of forfeiting all claim to the rank of a gentleman and where it is beneath the dignity of a man to oversee the labour of his own plantation the number of those who frequent these gaming houses may be imagined My young master fortunately for his own honour was of those who kept aloof from the precincts of the tavern unless compelled by necessary business to go there but the band of conspirators who had resolved on his destruction invited him through one of their number who pretended to wish to treat with him concerning his property to meet them at an ordinary one evening Here a quarrel was sought him and he was challenged to fight with pistols over the table around which they sat My master who it appears was unable to bear the reproach of cowardice even amongst fools agreed to fight and as he had no pistols with him was presented with a pair belonging to one of the gang and accepted their owner as his friend or second in the business The result was as might have been expected My master was killed at the first fire by a ball which passed through his breast whilst his antagonist escaped unharmed A servant was immediately despatched with a letter to my mistress informing her of the death of her husband She was awakened in the night to read the letter the bearer having informed her maid that it was necessary for her to see it immediately The shock drove her into a feverish delirium from which she never recovered At periods her reason resumed its dominion but in the summer following she became a mother and died in child-bed of puerperal fever I obtained this account from the mouth of a black man who was the travelling servant of the eldest son of my old master and who was with his master at the time he came to visit the tenant to whom he let his sister's estate in Georgia in the year The estate to which I was now attached was advertised to be rented for the term of seven years with all the stock of mules cattle and so forth upon it--together with seventeen slaves six of whom were too young to be able to work at present The price asked was one thousand dollars for the first year and two thousand dollars for each of the six succeeding years the tenant to be bound to clear thirty acres of land annually Before the day on which the estate was to be let by the terms of the advertisement a man came from the neighbourhood of Savannah and agreed to take the new plantation on the terms asked He was immediately put intop ossession of the premises and from this moment I became his slave for the term of seven years Fortune had now thrown me into the power of a new master of whom when I considered the part of the country from whence he came which had always been represented to me as distinguished for the cruelty with which slaves were treated in it I had no reason to expect much that was good I had indeed from the moment I saw this new master and had learned the place of his former residence made up my mind to prepare myself for a harsh servitude but as we are often disappointed for the worse so it sometimes happens that we are deceived for the better This man was by no means so bad as I was prepared to find him and yet I experienced all the evils in his service that I had ever apprehended but I could never find in my heart to entertain a revengeful feeling towards him for he was as much a slave as I was and I believe of the two the greater sufferer Perhaps the evils he endured himself made him more compassionate of the sorrows of others but notwithstanding the injustice that was done me while with him I could never look upon him as a bad man At the time he took possession of the estate he was alone and did not let us know that he had a wife until after he had been with us at least two weeks One day however he called us together and told us that he was going down the country to bring up his family--that he wished us to go on with the work on the place in the manner he pointed out and telling the rest of the hands that they must obey my orders he left us He was gone full two weeks and when he returned I had all the cleared land planted in cotton corn and sweet potatoes and had progressed with the business of the plantation so much to his satisfaction that he gave me a dollar with which I bought a pair of new trousers--my old ones having been worn out in clearing the new land and burning logs My master's family a wife and one child came with him and my new mistress soon caused me to regret the death of my former young master for other reasons than those of affection and esteem This woman though she was my mistress I cannot call her lady was the daughter of a very wealthy planter who resided near Milledgeville and had several children besides my mistress My master was a native of North Carolina--had removed to Georgia several years before this--had acquired some property and was married to my mistress more than two years when I became his slave for a term of years as I have stated I saw many families and was acquainted with the moral character of many ladies while I lived in the south but I must in justice to the country say that my new mistress was the worst woman I ever saw amongst the southern people Her temper was as bad as that of a speckled viper and her language when she was enraged was a mere vocabulary of profanity and virulence My master and mistress brought with them when they came twelve slaves great and small seven of whom were able to do field work We now had on our new place a very respectable force and my master was a man who understood the means of procuring a good day's work from his hands as well as any of his neighbours He was also a man who when left to pursue his own inclinations was kind and humane in his temper and conduct towards his people and if he had possessed courage enough to whip his wife two or three times as he sometimes whipped his slaves and to compel her to observe a rule of conduct befitting her sex I should have had a tolerable time of my servitude with him and should in all probability have been a slave in Georgia until this day Before my mistress came we had meat in abundance for my master had left his keys with me and I dealt out the provisions to the people Lest my master should complain of me at his return or suspect that I had not been faithful to my trust I had only allowed ourselves for I fared in common with the others one meal of meat in each day We had several cows that supplied us with and a barrel of molasses was amongst the stores of provisions We had mush sweet potatoes milk molasses and sometimes butter for breakfast and supper and meat for dinner Had we been permitted to enjoy this fine fare after the arrival of our mistress and had she been a woman of kindly disposition and lady-like manners I should have considered myself well off in the world for I was now living in as good a country as I ever saw and I much doubt if there is a better one anywhere Our mistress gave us a specimen of her character on the first morning after her arrival amongst us by beating severely with a raw cow-hide the black girl who nursed the infant because the child cried and could not be kept silent I perceived by this that my mistress possessed no control over her passions and that when enraged she would find some victim to pour her fury upon without regard to justice or mercy When we were called to dinner to-day we had no meat and a very short supply of bread our meal being composed of badly cooked sweet potatoes some bread and a very small quantity of sour milk From this time our allowance of meat was withdrawn from us altogether and we had to live upon our bread potatoes and the little milk that our mistress permitted us to have The most vexatious part of the new discipline was the distinction that was made between us who were on the plantation before our mistress came to it and the slaves that she brought with her To these latter she gave the best part of the sour milk all the buttermilk and I believe frequently rations of meat We were not on our part I mean us of the old stock wholly without meat for our master sometimes gave us a whole flitch of bacon at once this he had stolen from his own smoke-house--I say stolen because he took it without the knowledge of my mistress and always charged us in the most solemn manner not to let her know that we had received it She was as negligent of the duties of a good housewife as she was arrogant in assuming the control of things not within the sphere of her domestic duties and never missed the bacon that our master gave to us because she had not taken the trouble of examining the state of the meat-house Obtaining all the meat we ate by stealth through our master our supplies were not regular coming once or twice a-week according to circumstances However I was satisfied of the good intentions of my master towards me I felt interested in his welfare and in a short time became warmly attached to him He fared but little better at the hands of my mistress than I did except that as he ate at the same table with her he always had enough of comfortable food but in the matter of ill language I believe my master and I might safely have put our goods together as a joint stock in trade without either the one or the other being greatly the loser I had secured the good opinion of my master and it was perceivable by any one that he had more confidence in me than in any of his other slaves and often treated me as the foreman of his people This aroused the indignation of my mistress who with all her ill qualities retained a sort of selfish esteem for the slaves who had come with her from her father's estate She seldom saw me without giving me her customary salutation of profanity and she exceeded all other persons that I have ever known in the quickness and sarcasm of the jibes and jeers with which she seasoned her oaths To form any fair conception of her volubility and scurrilous wit it was necessary to hear her more especially on Sunday morning or a rainy day when the people were all loitering about the kitchens which stood close round her dwelling She treated my master with no more ceremony than she did me Misery loves company it is and I verily believe that my master and I felt a mutual attachment on account of our mutual sufferings XVIII The country I now lived in was new and abounded with every sort of game common to a new settlement Wages were high and I could sometimes earn a dollar and a half a day by doing job work on Sunday The price of a day's work here was a dollar My master paid me regularly and fairly for all the work I did for him on Sunday and I never went anywhere else to procure work All his other hands were treated in the same way He also gave me an old gun that had seen much hard service for the stock was quite shattered to pieces and the lock would not strike fire I took my gun to a blacksmith in the neighbourhood and he repaired the lock so that my musket was as sure fire as any piece need be I found upon trial that though the stock and lock had been worn out the barrel was none the worse for the service it had undergone I now for the first time in my life became hunter in the proper sense of the word and generally managed my affairs in such a way as to get the half of Saturday to myself This I did by prevailing on my master to set my task for the week on Monday morning Saturday was appropriated to hunting if I was not obliged to work all day and I soon became pretty expert in the use of my gun I made salt licks in the woods to which the deer came at night and I shot them from a seat of clapboards that was placed on the branches of a tree Rackoons abounded here and were of a large size and fat at all seasons In the month of April I saw the ground thickly strewed with nuts the growth of the last year I now began to live well notwithstanding the persecution that my mistress still directed against me and to feel myself in some measure an independent man Serpents of various kinds swarmed in this country I have killed more than twenty rattle-snakes in a day and copper-heads were innumerable but the snake that I most dreaded was the moccason which is quite as venomous as the copper-head or rattle-snake and much more active and malicious Vipers and other poisonous reptiles were innumerable and in the swamps was a monstrous serpent though of rare occurrence which was really dangerous on account of its prodigious size This snake is of a brown colour with ashy white spots distributed over its body It lives by catching rabbits and squirrels rackoons and other animals I have no doubt that some of this species would attack and swallow children several years old I once shot one of these snakes that was more than eight feet long and as thick as the leg of an ordinary man When coiled up it appeared as large as a small calf lying in its resting place Panthers wolves and other beasts of prey were common in the woods I had always observed that snakes congregate either in large groups or in pairs and that if one snake is killed another is soon after seen near the same place I one day killed an enormous rattle-snake in the cotton field near my master's house This snake was full six feet in length of a corresponding thickness and had fangs an inch and three-quarters in length When dead I skinned it and stretched the skin on a board A few days after having occasion to cross a fence near where I had killed the large snake and jumping from the top of the fence upon the ground without looking down I alighted close beside another rattle-snake quite as large as the one I had killed This one was lying at full length and I was surprised that it did not attempt to bite me nor even to throw itself into coil It only sounded its rattles making a noise sufficiently loud to be heard a hundred yards I killed this snake also and seeing it appear to be full of something that it had eaten I ripped it open with my knife and found the whole cavity of its body stuffed full of corn meal that it had eaten in the house where my master kept his stores to which it had found access through some aperture in the logs of the house The snake was so full of meal that it could not coil itself and thus saved my life for the bite of such a snake as this was is almost certain death I knew a white man some time afterwards who was bitten by one of these large rattle-snakes in the hand as he was trying to punch it to death with a stick in a hollow stump and he died before he could be taken to his own house which was little more than a mile from the place where he was bitten A neighbour of my master was one day hunting deer in the woods with hounds and hearing one of his hounds cry out as if hurt by something the gentlemen proceeded to the spot and found his dog lying in the agonies of death and a great rattle-snake near him On examining the dog it was found that the snake had struck him with its fangs in the side and cut a deep gash in the skin The dog being heated with running death ensued almost instantly I had a dog of my own which I had brought with me from Carolina and which was an excellent hunting dog He would tree rackoons and bears and chase deer and was so faithful that I thought he would lose his life if necessary in my defence but dogs like men have a certain limit beyond which their friendship will not carry them at least it was so with my dog Being in the woods one Sunday at a place called the goose-pond a shallow pool of water to which wild geese resorted my dog came out of the cane to me with his bristles raised and showing by his conduct that he had seen something in the canes of which he was afraid I had gone to the pond that for the purpose of cutting and putting into the water some sticks of a tree that grows in that part of Georgia of which very good ropes can be made The timber is cut and thrown into the water until the bark becomes soft and loose and it is then peeled off beaten and split to pieces and of this bark ropes can be made nearly equal to hempen ropes I got a good deal of money by making ropes of this bark and selling them At the time I speak of I had my axe with me but was without my gun I endeavoured in vain to induce my dog to enter into the cane-brake and started on my way home my dog keeping a little in advance of me and frequently looking back I had not proceeded far before the cause of my dog's alarm became manifest Looking behind me I saw a huge panther creeping along the path after me in the manner that a cat creeps when stealing upon her prey I felt myself in danger and again endeavoured to urge my dog to attack the panther but I could not prevail on him to place himself between me and the wild beast I stood still for some time and the panther lay down on the ground still however looking attentively at me When I again moved forward the panther moved after me and when I stopped and turned round it stopped also In this way I proceeded alternately advancing and halting with the panther sometimes within twenty steps of me until I came in view of my master's clearing when the panther turned off into the woods and I saw it no more I do not know whether this panther was in pursuit of me or my dog but whether of the one or the other it showed but little fear of both of us and I believe that if alone it would not have hesitated to attack either of us As soon as the panther disappeared I went home and told my master of my adventure He sent immediately to the house of a gentleman who lived two miles distant who came and brought his dogs with him These dogs when joined to my master's made five in number I went to the woods and showed the place where the panther had left me and the dogs immediately scented the trail It was then late in the evening and the chase was continued until near day-break the next morning when the panther was forced to take a tree ten miles from my master's house It was shot by my master with his rifle and after it was dead we measured it from the end of the nose to the tip of the tail and found the whole length to be eleven feet and ten inches In the fall of this year I went with my master to the Indian country to purchase and bring to the settlement cattle and Indian horses We travelled a hundred miles from the residence of my master nearly west before we came to any Indian village The country where the Indians lived was similar in soil and productions to that in which my master had settled and I saw several fields of corn amongst the Indians of excellent quality and well enclosed with substantial fences I also saw amongst these people several log-houses with square hewn logs Some cotton was growing in small patches in the fields but this plant was not extensively cultivated Large herds of cattle were ranging in the woods and cost their owners nothing for their keeping except a small quantity of salt These cattle were of the Spanish breed generally speckled but often of a dun or mouse colour and sometimes of a leaden gray They universally had long horns and dark muzzles and stood high on their legs with elevated and bold fronts When ranging in droves in the woods they were the finest cattle in appearance that I ever saw They make excellent working oxen but their quarters are not so heavy and fleshy as those of the English cattle The cows do not give large quantities of milk The Indian horses run at large in the woods like the cattle and receive no feed from their owners unless on some very extraordinary occasion They are small but very handsome little horses I do not know that I ever saw one of these horses more than fourteen hands high but they are very strong and active and when brought upon the plantation and broken to work they are hardy and docile and keep fat on very little food The prevailing colour of these horses is black but many of them are beautiful grays with flowing manes and tails and of their size are fine horses My master bought fifty horses and more than a hundred of the cattle and hired seven Indians to help us to drive them into the settlement We had only a path to travel in-- no road having been opened to the Indian country of width sufficient for wagons to pass upon it and I was often surprised at the agility of the Indians in riding the unbroken horses along this path and through the cane-brakes which lined it on either side in pursuit of the cattle when any of them attempted to leave the drove With the horses we had but little trouble after we had them once started on the path but the cattle were much inclined to separate and wander in the woods for several days after we set out from the Nation--but the greatest trouble was experienced at the time we halted in the evening for the night Some of the cattle and many of the horses would wander off from the fire to a great distance in the woods if not prevented and might attempt to return to the Indian country To obviate this as soon as the fire was kindled and the Indians had taken their supper they would take off into the woods in all directions and stationing themselves at the distance of about half a quarter of a mile from the fire would set up such a horrible yelling and whooping that the whole forest appeared to be full of demons come to devour us and our drove too This noise never failed to cause both horse and cattle to keep within the circle formed by the Indians and I believe we did not lose a single beast on the whole journey My master kept many of the cattle and several of the horses which he used on the plantation instead of mules The residue he sold among the planters and I believe the expedition yielded him a handsome profit in the end it also afforded me an opportunity of seeing the Cherokee Indians in their own country and of contrasting the immense difference that exists between man in a state of civilization and industry and man in a state of barbarism and indolence Ever since I had been in the southern country vast numbers of African negroes had been yearly imported but this year the business ceased altogether and I did not see any African who was landed in the United States after this date I shall here submit to the reader the results of the observations I have made on the regulations of southern society It is my opinion that the white people in general are not nearly so well informed in the southern states as they are in those lying farther north The cause of this may not be obvious to strangers but to a man who has resided amongst the cotton plantations it is quite plain There is a great scarcity of schools throughout all the cotton country that I have seen because the white population is so thinly scattered over the country and the families live so far apart that it is not easy to get a sufficient number of children together to constitute a school The young men of the country who have received educations proper to qualify them for the profession of teachers are too proud to submit to this kind of occupation and strangers who come from the north will not engage in a service that is held in contempt unless they can procure large salaries from individuals or get a great number of pupils to attend their instructions whose united contributions may amount in the aggregate to a large sum Great numbers of the young men of fortune are sent abroad to be educated but thousands of the sons of land and slave-holders receive very little education and pass their lives in ignorant idleness The poor white children are not educated at all It is my opinion that the women are not better educated than the men A few of the great families live in a style of luxury and magnificence on their estates that people in the north are not accustomed to witness but this splendour is made up of crowds of slaves employed as household servants and a gaudy show of silver plate rather than in good houses or convenient furniture Good beef and good mutton such are seen in Philadelphia and New-York are not known on the cotton plantations Good butter is also a rarity and in the summer time sweet flour or sweet wheaten bread is scarcely to be looked for The flour is imported from the north or west and in the hot damp climate of the southern summer it cannot be kept from souring more than four or five weeks The temper of my mistress grew worse daily--if that could grow worse which was already as bad as it could be-- and her enmity against me increased the more she observed that my master confided in me To enhance my misfortunes the health of my master began about this time visibly to decline and towards the latter end of the autumn of this year he one day told me that he believed he should not live long as he already felt the symptoms of approaching decay and death This was a source of much anxiety and trouble to me for I clearly foresaw that if ever I fell under the unbridled dominion of my mistress I should regret the worst period of my servitude in South Carolina I was much afraid as the winter came on that my master might grow worse and pass to the grave in the spring for his disease was a consumption of the lungs and it is well known that the spring of the year which brings joy gladness and vitality to all creation animate and inanimate except the victim of consumption is often the season that consigns him to the grave XIX We passed this winter in clearing land after we had secured the crops of cotton and corn and nothing happened on our plantation to disturb the usual monotony of the life of a slave except that in the month of January my master informed me that he intended to go to Savannah for the purpose of purchasing groceries and such other supplies as might be required on the plantation in the following season and that he intended to take down a load of cotton with our wagon and team and that I must prepare to be the driver This intelligence was not disagreeable to me as the trip to Savannah would in the first place release me for a short time from the tyranny of my mistress and in the second would give me an opportunity of seeing a great deal of strange country I derived a third advantage in after times from this journey but which did not enter into my estimate of this affair at that time My master had not yet erected a cotton-gin on his place-- the land not being his own--and we hauled our cotton in the seed nearly three miles to be ginned for which we had to give one-fourth to the owner of the gin When the time of my departure came I loaded my wagon with ten bales of cotton and set out with the same team of six mules that I had driven from South Carolina Nothing of moment happened to me until the evening of the fourth day when we were one hundred miles from home My master stopped to-night for he travelled with me on his horse at the house of an old friend of his and I heard my master in conversation with this gentleman for such he certainly was give me a very good character and tell him that I was the most faithful and trusty negro that he had ever owned He also that if he lived to see the expiration of the seven years for which he had leased me he intended to buy me He much more of me and I thought I heard him tell his friend something about my mistress but this was spoken in a low tone of voice and I could not distinctly understand it When I was going away in the morning with my team this gentleman came out to the wagon and ordered one of his own slaves to help me to put the harness on my mules At parting he told me to stop at his house on my return and stay all night and I should always be welcome to the use of his kitchen if it should ever be my lot to travel that way again I mention these trifles to show that if there are hard and cruel masters in the south there are also others of a contrary character The slave-holders are neither more nor less than men some of whom are good and very many are bad My master and this gentleman were certainly of the number of the good but the contrast between them and some others that I have seen was unhappily for many of the slaves very great I shall hereafter refer to this gentleman at whose house I now was and shall never name him without honour nor think of him without gratitude As I travelled through the country with my team my chief employment beyond my duty of a teamster was to observe the condition of the slaves on the various plantations by which we passed on our journey and to compare things in Georgia as I now saw them with similar things in Carolina as I had heretofore seen them There is as much sameness amongst the cotton plantations in Georgia as there is amongst the various farms in New-York or New-Jersey He who has seen one cotton field has seen all other cotton fields bating the difference that naturally results from good and bad soils or good and bad culture but the contrast that prevails in the treatment of the slaves on different plantations is very remarkable We travelled a road that was not well provided with public houses and we frequently stopped for the night at the private dwellings of the planters and I observed that my master was received as a visiter and treated as a friend in the family whilst I was always left at the road with my wagon my master supplying me with money to buy food for myself and my mules It was my practice when we remained all night at these gentlemen's houses to go to the kitchen in the evening after I had fed my mules and eaten my supper and pass some time in conversation with the black people I might chance to find there One evening we halted before sundown and I unhitched my mules at the road about two hundred yards from the house of a planter to which my master went to claim hospitality for himself After I had disposed of my team for the night and taken my supper I went as usual to see the people of colour in the kitchen belonging to this plantation The sun had just set when I reached the kitchen and soon afterwards a black boy came in and told the woman who was the only person in the kitchen when I came to it that she must go down to the overseer's house She immediately started in obedience to this order and not choosing to remain alone in a strange house I concluded to follow the woman and see the other people of this estate When we reached the house of the overseer the coloured people were coming in from the field and with them came the overseer and another man better dressed than overseers usually are I stood at some distance from these gentlemen not thinking it prudent to be too forward amongst strangers The black people were all called together and the overseer told them that some one of them had stolen a fat hog from the pen carried it to the woods and there killed and dressed it that he had that day found the place where the hog had been slaughtered and that if they did not confess and tell who the perpetrators of this theft were they would all be whipped in the severest manner To this threat no other reply was made than a universal assertion of the innocence of the accused They were all then ordered to lie down upon the ground and expose their backs to which the overseer applied the thong of his long whip by turns until he was weary It was fortunate for these people that they were more than twenty in number which prevented the overseer from inflicting many lashes on any one of them When the whole number had received each in turn a share of the lash the overseer returned to the man to whom he had first applied the whip and told him he was certain that he knew who stole the hog and that if he did not tell who the thief was he would whip him all night He then again applied the whip to the back of this man until the blood flowed copiously but the sufferer hid his face in his hands and not a word The other gentleman then asked the overseer if he was confident this man had stolen the pig and receiving an affirmative answer he he would make the fellow confess the truth if he would follow his directions He then asked the overseer if he had ever tried cat-hauling upon an obstinate negro and was told that this punishment had been heard of but never practised on this plantation A boy was then ordered to get up run to the house and bring a cat which was soon produced The cat which was a large gray tom-cat was then taken by the well-dressed gentleman and placed upon the bare back of the prostrate black man near the shoulder and forcibly dragged by the tail down the back and along the bare thighs of the sufferer The cat sunk his nails into the flesh and tore off pieces of the skin with his teeth The man roared with the pain of this punishment and would have rolled along the ground had be not been held in his place by the force of four other slaves each one of whom confined a hand or a foot As soon as the cat was drawn from him the man he would tell who stole the hog and confessed that he and several others three of whom were then holding him had stolen the hog--killed dressed and eaten it In return for this confession the overseer he should have another touch of the cat which was again drawn along his back not as before from the head downwards but from below the hips to the head The man was then permitted to rise and each of those who had been named by him as a participator in stealing the hog was compelled to lie down and have the cat twice drawn along his back first downwards and then upwards After the termination of this punishment each of the sufferers was washed with salt water by a black woman and they were then all dismissed This was the most excruciating punishment that I ever saw inflicted on black people and in my opinion it is very dangerous for the claws of the cat are poisonous and wounds made by them are very subject to inflammation During all this time I had remained at the distance of fifty yards from the place of punishment fearing either to advance or retreat lest I too might excite the indignation of these sanguinary judges After the business was over and my feelings became a little more composed I thought the voice or the gentleman in good clothes was familiar to me but I could not recollect who he was nor where I had heard his voice until the gentlemen at length left this place and went towards the great house and as they passed me I recognized in the companion of the overseer my old master the negro trader who had bought me in Maryland and brought me to Carolina I afterwards learned from my master that this man had formerly been engaged in the African slave-trade which he had given up some years before for the safer and less arduous business of buying negroes in the north and bringing them to the south as articles of merchandise in which he had acquired a very respectable fortune--had lately married in a wealthy family in this part of the country and was a great planter Two days after this we reached Savannah where my master sold his cotton and purchased a wagon load of sugar molasses coffee shoes dry goods and such articles as we stood in need of at home and on the next day after I entered the city I again left it and directed my course up the country In Savannah I saw many black men who were slaves and who yet acted as freemen so far that they went out to work where and with whom they pleased received their own wages and provided their own subsistence but were obliged to pay a certain sum at the end of each week to their masters One of these men told me that he paid six dollars on every Saturday evening to his master and yet he was comfortably dressed and appeared to live well Savannah was a very busy place and I saw vast quantities of cotton piled up on the wharves but the appearance of the town itself was not much in favour of the people who lived in it On my way home I travelled for several days by a road different from that which we had pursued in coming down and at the distance of fifty or sixty miles from Savannah I passed by the largest plantation that I had ever seen I think I saw at least a thousand acres of cotton in one field which was all as level as a bowling-green There were as I was told three hundred and fifty hands at work in this field picking the last of the cotton from the burs and these were the most miserable looking slaves that I had seen in all my travels It was now the depth of winter and although the weather was not cold yet it was the winter of this climate and a man who lives on the Savannah river a few years will find himself almost as much oppressed with cold in winter there as he would be in the same season of the year on the banks of the Potomac if he had always resided there These people were as far as I could see totally without shoes and there was no such garment as a hat of any kind amongst them Each person had a coarse blanket which had holes cut for the arms to pass through and the top was drawn up round the neck so as to form a sort of loose frock tied before with strings The arms when the people were at work were naked and some of them had very little clothing of any kind besides this blanket frock The appearance of these people afforded the most conclusive evidence that they were not eaters of pork and that lent lasted with them throughout the year I again staid all night as I went home with the gentleman whom I have before noticed as the friend of my master who had left me soon after we quitted Savannah and I saw him no more until I reached home Soon after my return from Savannah an affair of a very melancholy character took place in the neighbourhood of my master's plantation About two miles from our residence lived a gentleman who was a bachelor and who had for his housekeeper a mulatto woman The master was a young man not more than twenty-five years old and the housekeeper must have been at least forty She had children grown up one of whom had been sold by her master the father of the bachelor since I lived here and carried away to the west This woman had acquired a most unaccountable influence over her young master who lived with her as his wife and gave her the entire command of his house and of every thing about it Before he came to live where he now did and whilst he still resided with his father to whom the woman then belonged the old gentleman perceiving the attachment of his son to this female had sold her to a trader who was on his way to the Mississippi river in the absence of the young man but when the latter returned home and learned what had been done he immediately set off in pursuit of the purchaser overtook him somewhere in the Indian territory and bought the woman of him at an advanced price He then brought her back and put her as his housekeeper on the place where he now lived left his father and came to rejoice in person with the woman On a plantation adjoining that of the gentleman bachelor lived a planter who owned a young mulatto man named Frank not more than twenty-four or five years old a very smart as well as handsome fellow Frank had become as much enamoured of this woman who was old enough to have been his mother as her master the bachelor was and she returned Frank's attachment to the prejudice of her owner Frank was in the practice of visiting his mistress at night a circumstance of which her master was suspicious and he forbade Frank from coming to the house This only heightened the flame that was burning in the bosoms of the lovers and they resolved after many and long deliberations to destroy the master She projected the plot and furnished the means for the murder by taking her master's gun from the place where he usually kept it and giving it to Frank who came to the house in the evening when the gentleman was taking his supper alone Lucy always waited upon her master at his meals and knowing his usual place of sitting had made a hole between two of the logs of the house towards which she knew his back would be at supper At a given signal Frank came quietly up to the house levelled the gun through the hole prepared for him and discharged a load of buck-shot between the shoulders of the unsuspecting master who sprang from his seat and fell dead beside the table This murder was not known in the neighbourhood until the next morning when the woman herself went to a house on an adjoining plantation and told it The murdered gentleman had several other slaves none of whom were at home at the time of his death except one man and he was so terrified that he was afraid to run and alarm the neighbourhood I knew this man well and believe he was afraid of the woman and her accomplice I never had any doubt of his innocence though he suffered a punishment upon no other evidence than mere suspicion far more terrible than any ordinary form of death As soon as the murder was known to the neighbouring gentlemen they hastened to visit the dead body and were no less expeditious in instituting inquiries after those who had done the bloody deed My master was amongst the first who arrived at the house of the deceased and in a short time half the slaves of the neighbouring plantations were arrested and brought to the late dwelling of the dead man For my own part from the moment I heard of the murder I had no doubt of its author Silence is a great virtue when it is dangerous to speak and I had long since determined never to advance opinions uncalled for in controversies between the white people and the slaves Many witnesses were examined by a justice of the peace before the coroner arrived but after the coming of the latter a jury was called and more than half a day was spent in asking questions of various black people without the disclosure of any circumstance which tended to fix the guilt of the murder upon any one My master who was present all this time at last desired them to examine me if it was thought that my testimony could be of any service in the matter as he wished me to go home to attend to my work I was sworn on the testament to tell the whole truth and stated at the commencement of my testimony that I believed Frank and Lucy to be the murderers and proceeded to assign the reasons upon which my opinion was founded Frank had not been present at this examination and Lucy who had been sworn had she knew nothing of the matter that at the time her master was shot she had gone into the kitchen for some milk for his supper and that on hearing the gun she had come into the room at the moment he fell to the floor and expired but when she opened the door and looked out she could neither hear nor see any one When Frank was brought in and made to touch the dead body which he was compelled to do because some that if he was the murderer the corpse would bleed at his touch he trembled so much that I thought he would fall but no blood issued from the wound of the dead man This compulsory touching of the dead had however in this instance a much more powerful effect in the conviction of the criminal than the flowing of any quantity of blood could have had for as soon as Frank had withdrawn his hand from the touch of the dead the coroner asked him in a peremptory tone as conscious of the fact why he had done this Frank was so confounded with fear and overwhelmed by this interrogatory that he lost all self-possession and cried out in a voice of despair that Lucy had made him do it Lucy who had left the room when Frank was brought in was now recalled and confronted with her partner in guilt but nothing could wring a word of confession from her She persisted that if Frank had murdered her master he had done it of his own accord and without her knowledge or advice Some one now for the first time thought of making search for the gun of the dead man which was not found in the place where he usually had kept it Frank he had committed the crime with this gun which had been placed in his hands by Lucy Frank Lucy and Billy a black man against whom there was no evidence nor cause of suspicion except that he was in the kitchen at the time of the murder were committed to prison in a new log-house on an adjoining plantation closely confined in irons and kept there a little more than two weeks when they were all tried before some gentlemen of the neighbourhood who held a court for that purpose Lucy and Frank were condemned to be hung but Billy was found not guilty although he was not released but kept in confinement until the execution of his companions which took place ten days after the trial On the morning of the execution my master told me and all the rest of the people that we must go to the hanging as it was termed by him as well as others The place of punishment was only two miles from my master's residence and I was there in time to get a good stand near the gallows' tree by which I was enabled to see all the proceedings connected with this solemn affair It was estimated by my master that there were at least fifteen thousand people present at this scene more than half of whom were blacks all the masters for a great distance round the country having permitted or compelled their people to come to this hanging Billy was brought to the gallows with Lucy and Frank but was permitted to walk beside the cart in which they rode Under the gallows after the rope was around her neck Lucy confessed that the murder had been designed by her in the first place and that Frank had only perpetrated it at her instance She she had at first intended to apply to Billy to assist her in the undertaking but had afterwards communicated her designs to Frank who offered to shoot her master if she would supply him with a gun and let no other person be in the secret A long sermon was preached by a white man under the gallows which was only the limb of a tree and afterwards an exhortation was delivered by a black man The two convicts were hung together and after they were quite dead a consultation was held among the gentlemen as to the future disposition of Billy who having been in the house when his master was murdered and not having given immediate information of the fact was held to be guilty of concealing the death and was accordingly sentenced to receive five hundred lashes I was in the branches of a tree close by the place where the court was held and distinctly heard its proceedings and judgment Some went to the woods to cut hickories whilst others stripped Billy and tied him to a tree More than twenty long switches some of them six or seven feet in length had been procured and two men applied the rods at the same time one standing on each side of the culprit one of them using his left hand I had often seen black men whipped and had always when the lash was applied with great severity heard the sufferer cry out and beg for mercy but in this case the pain inflicted by the double blows of the hickory was so intense that Billy never uttered so much as a groan and I do not believe he breathed for the space of two minutes after he received the first strokes He shrank his body close to the trunk of the tree around which his arm and legs were lashed drew his shoulders up to his head like a dying man and trembled or rather shivered in all his members The blood flowed from the commencement and in a few minutes lay in small puddles at the root of the tree I saw flakes of flesh as long as my finger fall out of the gashes in his back and I believe he was insensible during all the time that he was receiving the last two hundred lashes When the whole five hundred lashes had been counted by the person appointed to perform this duty the half dead body was unbound and laid in the shade of the tree upon which I sat The gentlemen who had done the whipping eight or ten in number being joined by their friends then came under the tree and drank punch until their dinner was made ready under a booth of green boughs at a short distance After dinner Billy who had been groaning on the ground where he was laid was taken up placed in the cart in which Lucy and Frank had been brought to the gallows and conveyed to the dwelling of his late master where he was confined to the house and his bed more than three months and was never worth much afterwards while I remained in Georgia Lucy and Frank after they had been half an hour upon the gallows were cut down and suffered to drop into a deep hole that had been dug under them whilst they were suspended As they fell so the earth was thrown upon them and the grave closed over them for ever They were hung on Thursday and the vast assemblage of people that had convened to witness their death did not leave the place altogether until the next Monday morning Wagons carts and carriages had been brought upon the ground booths and tents erected for the convenience and accommodation of the multitude and the terrible spectacles that I have just described were succeeded by music dancing trading in horses gambling drinking fighting and every other species of amusement and excess to which the southern people are addicted I had to work in the day-time but went every night to witness this funereal carnival the numbers that joined in which appeared to increase rather than diminish during the Friday and Saturday that followed the execution It was not until Sunday afternoon that the crowd began sensibly to diminish and on Monday morning after breakfast time the last wagons left the ground now trampled into dust as dry and as light as ashes and the grave of the murderers was left to the solitude of the woods Certainly those who were hanged well deserved their punishment but it was a very arbitrary exercise of power to whip a man until he was insensible because he did not prevent a murder which was committed without his knowledge and I could not understand the right of punishing him because he was so weak or timorous as to refrain from the disclosure of the crime the moment it came to his knowledge It is necessary for the southern people to be vigilant in guarding the moral condition of their slaves and even to punish the intention to commit crimes when that intention can be clearly proved for such is the natural relation of master and slave in by far the greater number of cases that no cordiality of feeling can ever exist between them and the sentiments that bind together the different members of society in a state of freedom and social equality being absent the master must resort to principles of physical restraint and rules of mental coercion unknown in another and a different condition of the social compact It is a mistake to suppose that the southern planters could ever retain their property or live amongst their slaves if those slaves were not kept in terror of the punishment that would follow acts of violence disorder There is no difference between the feelings of the different races of men so far as their personal rights are concerned The black man is as anxious to possess and to enjoy liberty as the white one would be were he deprived of this inestimable blessing It is not for me to say that the one is as well qualified for the enjoyment of liberty as the other Low ignorance moral degradation of character and mental depravity are inseparable companions and in the breast of an ignorant man the passions of envy and revenge hold unbridled dominion It was in the month of April that I witnessed the painful spectacle of two fellow-creatures being launched into the abyss of eternity and a third being tortured beyond the sufferings of mere death not for his crimes but as a terror to others and this not to deter others from the commission of crimes but to stimulate them to a more active and devoted performance of their duties to their owners My spirits had not recovered from the depression produced by that scene in which my feelings had been awakened in the cause of others when I was called to a nearer and more immediate apprehension of sufferings which I now too clearly saw were in preparation for myself My master's health became worse continually and I expected he would not survive this summer In this however I was disappointed but he was so ill that he was seldom able to come to the field and paid but little attention to his plantation or the culture of his crops He left the care of the cotton field to me after the month of June and was not again out on the plantation before the following October when he one day came out on a little Indian pony that he had used as his hackney before he was so far reduced as to decline the practice of riding I suffered very much this summer for want of good and substantial provisions my master being no longer able to supply me with his usual liberality from his own meat house I was obliged to lay out nearly all my other earnings in the course of the summer for bacon to enable me to bear the hardship and toil to which I was exposed My master often sent for me to come to the house and talked to me in a very kind manner and I believe that no hired overseer could have carried on the business more industriously than I did until the crop was secured the next winter Soon after my master was in the field in October he sent for me to come to him one day and gave me on parting a pretty good great coat of strong drab cloth almost new which he would be of service to me in the coming winter He also gave me at the same time a pair of boots which he had worn half out but the legs of which were quite good This great coat and these boots were afterwards of great service to me As the winter came on my master grew worse and though he still continued to walk about the house in good weather it was manifest that he was approaching the close of his earthly existence I worked very hard this winter The crop of cotton was heavy and we did not get it all out of the field until some time after Christmas which compelled me to work hard myself and cause my fellow-slaves to work hard too in clearing the land that my master was bound to clear every year on this place He desired me to get as much of the land cleared in time for cotton as I could and to plant the rest with corn when cleared off As I was now entrusted with the entire superintendence of the plantation by my master who never left his house it became necessary for me to assume the authority of an overseer of my fellow-slaves and I not unfrequently found it proper to punish them with stripes to compel them to perform their work At first I felt much repugnance against the use of the hickory the only instrument with which I punished offenders but the longer I was accustomed to this practice the more familiar and less offensive it became to me and I believe that a few years of perseverance and experience would have made me as inveterate a negro-driver as any in Georgia though I feel conscious that I never should have become so hardened as to strip a person for the purpose of whipping nor should I ever have consented to compel people to work without a sufficiency of good food if I had it in my power to supply them with enough of this first of comforts In the month of February my master became so weak and his cough was so distressing that he took to his bed from which he never again departed save only once before the time when he was removed to be wrapped in his winding-sheet In the month of March two of the brothers of my mistress came to see her and remained with her until after the death of my master When they had been with their sister about three weeks they came to the kitchen one day when I had come in for my dinner and told me that they were going to whip me I asked them what they were going to whip me for to which they replied that they thought a good whipping would be good for me and that at any rate I must prepare to take it My mistress now joined us and after swearing at me in the most furious manner for a space of several minutes and bestowing upon me a multitude of the coarsest epithets told me that she had long owed me a whipping and that I should now get it She then ordered me to take off my shirt the only garment I had on except a pair of old tow linen trowsers and the two brothers backed the command of their sister the one by presenting a pistol at my breast and the other by drawing a large club over his head in the attitude of striking me Resistance was vain and I was forced to yield My shirt being off I was tied by the hands with a stout bed-cord and being led to a tree called the Pride of China that grew in the yard my hands were drawn by the rope being passed over a limb until my feet no longer touched the ground Being thus suspended in the air by the rope and my whole weight hanging on my wrists I was unable to move any part of my person except my feet and legs I had never been whipped since I was a boy and felt the injustice of the present proceeding with the utmost keenness but neither justice nor my feelings had any influence upon the hearts of my mistress and her brothers two men as cruel in temper and as savage in manners as herself The first strokes of the hickory produced a sensation that I can only liken to streams of scalding water running along my back but after a hundred or hundred and fifty lashes had been showered upon me the pain became less acute and piercing but was succeeded by a dead and painful aching which seemed to extend to my very backbone As I hung by the rope the moving of my legs sometimes caused me to turn round and soon after they began to beat me I saw the pale and death-like figure of my master standing at the door when my face was turned toward the house and heard him in a faint voice scarcely louder than a strong breathing commanding his brothers-in-law to let me go These commands were disregarded until I had received full three hundred lashes and doubtlessly more would have been inflicted upon me had not my master with an effort beyond his strength by the aid of a stick on which he supported himself made his way to me and placing his skeleton form beside me as I hung told his brothers-in-law that if they struck another stroke he would send for a lawyer and have them both prosecuted at law This interposition stopped the progress of my punishment and after cutting me down they carried my master again into the house I was yet able to walk and went into the kitchen whither my mistress followed and compelled me to submit to be washed in brine by a black woman who acted as her cook I was then permitted to put my shirt on and to go to my bed This was Saturday and on the next day when I awoke late in the morning I found myself unable to turn over or to rise I felt too indignant at the barbarity with which I had been treated to call for help from any one and lay in my bed made of corn husks until after twelve o'clock when my mistress came to me and asked me how I was A slave must not manifest feelings of resentment and I answered with humility that I was very sore and unable to get up She then called a man and a woman who came and raised me up but I now found that my shirt was as fast to my back as if it had grown there The blood and bruised flesh having become incorporated with the substance of the linen it formed only the outer coat of the great scab that covered my back After I was down stairs my mistress had me washed in warm water and warm grease was rubbed over my back and sides until the shirt was saturated with oil and becoming soft was at length separated from my back My mistress then had my back washed and greased and put upon me one of my master's old linen shirts She had become alarmed and was fearful either that I should die or would not be able to work again for a long time As it was she lost a month of my labour at this time and in the end she lost myself in consequence of this whipping As soon as I was able to walk my master sent for me to come to his bed-side and told me that he was very sorrow for what had happened that it was not his fault and that if he had been well I should never have been touched Tears came in his eyes as he talked to me and that as he could not live long he hoped I would continue faithful to him whilst he did live This I promised to do for I really loved my master but I had already determined that as soon as he was in his grave I would attempt to escape from Georgia and the cotton country if my life should be the forfeiture of the attempt As soon as I had recovered of my wounds I again went to work not in my former situation of superintendent of my master's plantation for this place was now occupied by one of the brothers of my mistress but in the woods where my mistress had determined to clear a new field After this time I did nothing but grub and clear land while I remained in Georgia but I was always making preparations for my departure from that country My master was an officer of militia and had a sword which he wore on parade days and at other times he hung it up in the room where he slept I conceived an idea that this sword would be of service to me in the long journey that I intended to undertake One evening when I had gone in to see my master and had remained standing at his bed-side some time he closed his eyes as if going to sleep and it being twilight I slipped the sword from the place where it hung and dropped it out of the window I knew my master could never need this weapon again but yet I felt some compunction of conscience at the thought of robbing so good a man When I left the room I took up the sword and afterwards secreted it in a hollow tree in the woods near the place at which I worked daily XX My master died in the month of May and I followed him to his grave with a heavy heart for I felt that I had lost the only friend I had in the world who possessed at once the power and the inclination to protect me against the tyranny and oppression to which slaves on a cotton plantation are subject Had he lived I should have remained with him and never have left him for he had promised to purchase the residue of my time of my owners in Carolina but when he was gone I felt the parting of the last tie that bound me to the place where I then was and my heart yearned for my wife and children from whom I had now been separated more than four years I held my life in small estimation if it was to be worn out under the dominion of my mistress and her brothers though since the death of my master she had greatly meliorated my condition by giving me frequent allowances of meat and other necessaries I believe she entertained some vague apprehensions that I might run away and betake myself to the woods for a living perhaps go to the Indians but I do not think she ever suspected that I would hazard the untried undertaking of attempting to make my way back to Maryland My purpose was fixed and now nothing could shake it I only waited for a proper season of the year to commence my toilsome and dangerous journey As I must of necessity procure my own subsistence on my march it behoved me to pay regard to the time at which I took it up I furnished myself with a fire-box as it is called that is a tin case containing flints steel and tinder this I considered indispensable I took the great coat that my master had given me and with a coarse needle and thread quilted a scabbard of old cloth in one side of it in which I could put my sword and carry it with safety I also procured a small bag of linen that held more than a peck This bag I filled with the meal of parched corn grinding the corn after it was parched in the wood where I worked at the mill at night These operations except the grinding of the corn I carried on in a small conical cabin that I had built in the woods The boots that my master gave me I had repaired by a Spaniard who lived in the neighbourhood and followed the business of a cobbler Before the first of August I had all my preparations completed and had matured them with so much secrecy that no one in the country white or black suspected me of entertaining any extraordinary design I only waited for the corn to be ripe and fit to be roasted which time I had fixed as the period of my departure I watched the progress of the corn daily and on the eighth of August I perceived on examining my mistress' field that nearly half of the ears were so far grown that by roasting them a man could easily subsist himself and as I knew that this corn had been planted later than the most of the corn in the country I resolved to take leave of the plantation and its tenants for ever on the next day I had a faithful dog called Trueman and this poor animal had been my constant companion for more than four years without ever showing cowardice or infidelity but once and that was when the panther followed us from the woods I was accordingly anxious to bring my dog with me but as I knew the success of my undertaking depended on secrecy and silence I thought it safest to abandon my last friend and engage in my perilous enterprise alone On the morning of the ninth I went to work as usual carrying my dinner with me and worked diligently at grubbing until about one o'clock in the day I now sat down and took my last dinner as the slave of my mistress dividing the contents of my basket with my dog After I had finished I tied my dog with a rope to a small tree I set my gun against it for I thought I should be better without the gun than with it tied my knapsack with my bag of meal on my shoulders and then turned to take a last farewell of my poor dog that stood by the tree to which he was bound looking wistfully at me When I approached him he licked my hands and then rising on his hind feet and placing his fore paws on my breast he uttered a long howl which thrilled through my heart as if he had My master do not leave me behind you All the affection that the poor animal had testified for me in the course of his life now rose fresh in my memory I recollected that he had always been ready to lay down his life for me that when I was tied and bound to the tree to be whipped they were forced to compel me to order my dog to be quiet to prevent him from attacking my executioner in my defence and even when he fled from the panther he had not left me only advancing a few feet before me and beckoning me to fly from an enemy whose strength was too great for us to contend against with hope of success and I now felt assured that had the panther attacked me my dog would have conquered at my side or have died in defending me This was the first time that I had ever tied him I had often left him for a whole day to guard my coat my basket or my gun which he never deserted and he now seemed to feel that I charge him with ingratitude and infidelity when I bound him to a charge which I had never known him to forsake As I was now leaving my dog for ever I talked to him as to a creature that understood language and was sensible of the dangers I was going to meet Poor Trueman faithful Trueman fare thee well Thou hast been an honest dog and sure friend to thy master in all his shades of fortune When my basket was well filled how cheerfully we have partaken together of its contents I did not then upbraid thee that thou atest in idleness the proceeds of my labour for I knew that thy heart was devoted to thy protector In the day of my adversity when all the world had forsaken me when my master was dead and I had no friend to protect me still poor Trueman thou wert the same Thou laidest thyself down at my feet when the world had united to oppress me How often when I was sick and the fever raged in my veins didst thou come at the going down of the sun and lick my feet in token of thy faith and how patiently didst thou watch with thy poor master through the long and lonely night When I had no crumbs in my basket to give thee nor crust in my pocket to divide with thee thy faithful heart failed not and a glance from the eye of thy hungry master filled thee with gratitude and joy Poor dog I must bid thee farewell To-morrow they will come and release thee Perhaps they will hate thee for my sake and persecute thee as they have persecuted me but I leave thee my gun to secure thee protection at the hands of those who will be the arbiters of thy fate when I am gone It is all the legacy I can give thee and surely they will not kill so good a dog when they see him possessed of so true a gun Man is selfish and heartless-- the richest of them all are as wretched slaves as I am and are only minions of fear and avarice Could pride and ambition witness thy fidelity and gratitude to thy forsaken master and learn humility from thy example how many tears would be wiped from the eyes of sorrow Follow the new master who shall possess my gun and may he be as kind to thee as thou hast been faithful to me I now took to the forest keeping as nearly as I could a north course all the afternoon Night overtook me before I reached any watercourse or any other object worthy of being noticed and I lay down and slept soundly without kindling a fire or eating any thing I was awake before day and as soon as there was light enough to enable me to see my way I resumed my journey and walked on until about eight o'clock when I came to a river which I knew must be the Appalachie I sat down on the bank of the river opened my bag of meal and made my breakfast of a part of its contents I used my meal very sparingly it being the most valuable treasure that I now possessed though I had in my pocket three Spanish dollars but in my situation this money could not avail me any thing as I was resolved not to show myself to any person either white or black After taking my breakfast I prepared to cross the river which was here about a hundred yards wide with a sluggish and deep current The morning was sultry and the thickets along the margin of the river teemed with insects and reptiles By sounding the river with a pole I found the stream too deep to be waded and I therefore prepared to swim it For this purpose I stripped myself and bound my clothes on the top of my knapsack and my bag of meal on the top of my clothes then drawing my knapsack close up to my head I threw myself into the river In my youth I had learned to swim in the Patuxent and have seldom met with any person who was more at ease in deep water than myself I kept a straight line from the place of my entrance into the Appalchie to the opposite side and when I had reached it stepped on the margin of the land and turned round to view the place from which I had set out on my aquatic passage but my eye was arrested by an object nearer to me than the opposite shore Within twenty feet of me in the very line that I had pursued in crossing the river a large alligator was moving in full pursuit of me with his nose just above the surface in the position that creature takes when he gives chase to his intended prey in the water The alligator can swim more than twice as fast as a man for he can overtake young ducks on the water and had I been ten seconds longer in the river I should have been dragged to the bottom and never again been heard of Seeing that I had gained the shore my pursuer turned made two or three circles in the water close by me and then disappeared I received this admonition as a warning of the dangers that I must encounter in my journey to the north After adjusting my clothes I again took to the woods and bore a little to the east of north it now being my determination to turn down the country so as to gain the line of the roads by which I had come to the south I travelled all day in the woods but a short time before sundown came within view of an opening in the forest which I took to be cleared fields but upon a closer examination finding no fences or other enclosures around it I advanced into it and found it to be an open savannah with a small stream of water creeping slowly through it At the lower side of the open space were the remains of an old beaver dam the central part of which had been broken away by the current of the stream at the time of some flood Around the margin of this former pond I observed several decayed beaver lodges and numerous stumps of small trees that had been cut down for the food or fortifications of this industrious little nation which had fled at the approach of the white man and all its people were now like me seeking refuge in the deepest solitudes of the forest from the glance of every human eye As it was growing late and I believed I must now be near the settlements I determined to encamp for the night beside this old beaver dam I again took my supper from my bag of meal and made my bed for the night amongst the canes that grew in the place This night I slept but little for it seemed as if all the owls in the country had assembled in my neighbourhood to perform a grand musical concert Their hooting and chattering commenced soon after dark and continued until the dawn of day In all parts of the southern country the owls are very numerous especially along the margins of streams and in the low grounds with which the waters are universally bordered but since I had been in the country although I had passed many nights in the woods at all seasons of the year I had never before heard so clamorous and deafening a chorus of nocturnal music With the coming of morning I arose from my couch and proceeded warily along the woods keeping a continual lookout for plantations and listening attentively to every noise that I heard in the trees or amongst the cane-brakes When the sun had been up two or three hours I saw an appearance of blue sky at a distance through the trees which proved that the forest had been removed from a spot somewhere before me and at no great distance from me and as I cautiously advanced I heard the voices of people in loud conversation Sitting down amongst the palmetto plants that grew around me in great numbers I soon perceived that the people whose conversation I heard were coming nearer to me I now heard the sound of horses' feet and immediately afterwards saw two men on horseback with rifles on their shoulders riding through the woods and moving on a line that led them past me at a distance of about fifty or sixty yards Perceiving that these men were equipped as hunters I remained almost breathless for the purpose of hearing their conversation When they came so near that I could distinguish their words they were talking of the best place to take a stand for the purpose of seeing the deer from which I inferred that they had sent men to some other point for the purpose of rousing the deer with dogs After they had passed that point of their way that was nearest to me and were beginning to recede from me one of them asked the other if he had heard that a negro had run away the day before yesterday in Morgan county to which his companion answered in the negative The first then he had seen an advertisement at the store which offered a hundred dollars reward for the runaway whose name was Charles The conversation of these horsemen was now interrupted by the cry of hounds at a distance in the woods and heightening the speed of their horses they were soon out of my sight and hearing Information of the state of the country through which I was travelling was of the highest value to me and nothing could more nearly interest me than a knowledge of the fact that my flight was known to the white people who resided round about and before me It was now necessary for me to become doubly vigilant and to concert with myself measures of the highest moment The first resolution that I took was that I would travel no more in the day-time This was the season of hunting deer and knowing that the hunters were under the necessity of being as silent as possible in the woods I saw at a glance that they would be at least as likely to discover me in the forest before I could see them as I should be to see them before I myself could be seen I was now very hungry but exceedingly loath to make any further breaches on my bag of meal except in extreme necessity Feeling confident that there was a plantation within a few rods of me I was anxious to have a view of it in hope that I might find a corn-field upon it from which I could obtain a supply of roasting ears Fearful to stand upright I crept along through the low ground where I then was at times raising myself to my knees for the purpose of obtaining a better view of things about me In this way I advanced until I came in view of a high fence and beyond this saw cotton tall and flourishing but no sign of corn I crept up close to the fence where I found the trunk of a large tree that had been felled in clearing the field Standing upon this and looking over the plantation I saw the tassels of corn at the distance of half a mile growing in a field which was bordered on one side by the wood in which I stood It was now nine or ten o'clock in the morning and as I had slept but little the night before I crept into the bushes great numbers of which grew in and about the top of the fallen tree and hungry as I was fell asleep When I awoke it appeared to me from the position of the sun which I had carefully noted before I lay down to be about one or two o'clock As this was the time of the day when the heat is most oppressive and when every one was most likely to be absent from the forest I again moved and taking a circuitous route at some distance from the fields reached the fence opposite the corn-field without having met with any thing to alarm me Having cautiously examined every thing around me as well by the eye as by the ear and finding all quiet I ventured to cross the fence and pluck from the standing stalks about a dozen good ears of corn with which I stole back to the thicket in safety This corn was of no use to me without fire to roast it and it was equally dangerous to kindle fire by night as by day the light at one time and the smoke at another might betray me to those who I knew were ever ready to pursue and arrest me Hunger eats through stone walls says the proverb and an empty stomach is a petitioner whose solicitations cannot be refused if there is any thing to satisfy them with Having regained the woods in safety I ventured to go as far as the side of a swamp which I knew to be at the distance of two or three hundred yards by the appearance of the timber When in the swamp I felt pretty secure but determined that I would never again attempt to travel in the neighbourhood of a plantation in the daytime When in the swamp a quarter of a mile I collected some dry wood and lighted it with the aid of my tinder-box flint and steel This was the first fire that I kindled on my journey and I was careful to burn none but dry wood to prevent the formation of smoke Here I roasted my corn and ate as much of it as I could After my dinner I lay down and slept for three or four hours When I awoke the sun was scarcely visible through the tree tops It was evening and prudence required me to leave the swamp before dark lest I should not be able to find my way out Approaching the edge of the swamp I watched the going down of the sun and noted the stars as they appeared in the heavens I had long since learned to distinguish the north-star from all the other small luminaries of the night and the seven pointers were familiar to me These heavenly bodies were all the guides I had to direct me on my way and as soon as the night had set in I commenced my march through the woods bearing as nearly due east as I could I took this course for the purpose of getting down the country as far as the road leading from Augusta to Morgan County with the intention of pursuing the route by which I had come out from South Carolina deeming it more safe to travel the high road by night than to attempt to make my way at random over the country guided only by the stars I travelled all night keeping the north-star on my left hand as nearly as I could and passing many plantations taking care to keep at a great distance from the houses I think I travelled at least twenty-five miles to-night without passing any road that appeared so wide or so much beaten as that which I had travelled when I came from South Carolina This night I passed through a peach orchard laden with fine ripe fruit with which I filled my pockets and hat and before day in crossing a corn-field I pulled a supply of roasting-ears with which and my peaches I retired at break of day to a large wood into which I travelled more than a mile before I halted Here in the midst of a thicket of high whortleberry bushes I encamped for the day I made my breakfast upon roasted corn and peaches and then lay down and slept unmolested until after twelve o'clock when I awoke and rose up for the purpose of taking a better view of my quarters but I was scarcely on my feet when I was attacked by a swarm of hornets that issued from a large nest that hung on the limb of a tree within twenty or thirty feet of me I knew that the best means of making peace with my hostile neighbours was to lie down with my face to the ground and this attitude I quickly took not however before I had been stung by several of my assailants which kept humming through the air about me for a long time and prevented me from leaving this spot until after sundown and after they had retired to rest for the night I now commenced the attack on my part and taking a handful of dry leaves approached the nest which was full as large as a half bushel and thrusting the leaves into the hole at the bottom of the nest through which its tenants passed in and out secured the whole garrison prisoners in their own citadel I now cut off the branch upon which the nest hung and threw it with its contents into my evening fire over which I roasted a supply of corn for my night's journey Commencing my march this evening soon after nightfall I travelled until about one o'clock in the morning as nearly as I could estimate the time by the appearance of the stars when I came upon a road which from its width and beaten appearance I took to be the road leading to Augusta and determined to pursue it I travelled on this road until I saw the appearance of daylight when I turned into the woods and went full a mile before I ventured to stop for the day I concealed myself to-day in a thicket of young pine trees that had sprung up round about an old pen of logs which had formerly been used either as a wolf or turkey trap In this retreat nothing disturbed me this day and at dark I again returned to the road which I travelled in silence treading as lightly as possible with my feet and listening most attentively to every sound that I heard After being on the road more than an hour I heard the sound of the feet of horses and immediately stepped aside and took my place behind the trunk of a large tree Within a minute or two several horses with men on them passed me The men were talking to each other and one of them asked another in my hearing if it was not about five miles to the Oconee The reply was too low to be understood by me but I was now satisfied that I was on the high road leading down the country on the Savannah side of Oconee Waiting until these horsemen were out of hearing I followed them at a brisk walk and within less than on hour came to the side of a river the width of which I could not ascertain by reason of the darkness of the night some fog having risen from the water I had no doubt that this stream was the Oconee and as I had heretofore forded that river with a wagon and team I procured a long stick from the shore and entered the river with all my clothes on me except my great coat and pantaloons which I carried on my back The river proved shallow not being more than four feet deep in the deepest part and I had proceeded in safety beyond the middle of the stream when I heard the noise produced by horses' feet in front of me and within two or three minutes several horsemen rode into the river directly before me and advanced towards me I now stooped down into the water so as to leave nothing but my head and the upper part of my pack above its surface and waited the passage of the strangers who after riding into the river until the water washed the bellies of their horses stopped to permit the animals to drink two of them being at this time not more than ten yards from me Here they entered into conversation with each other and one it was his opinion that that fellow had not come this way at all The other then asked what his name was and the first replied that he was called Charles in the advertisement but that he would no doubt call himself by some other name as runaway negroes always took some false name and assumed a false character I now knew that I was within a few feet of a party who were patrolling the country in search of me and that nothing could save me from falling into their hands but the obscurity produced by the fog There were no clouds and if the fog had not been in the air they must have perceived my head on the smooth surface of the water and have known that it was no stump or log of wood After a few minutes of pause these gentlemen all rode on to the side of the river from which I had come and in a short time were out of hearing Notwithstanding they were gone I remained in the water full a quarter of an hour until I was certain that no other persons were moving along the road near me These were the same gentlemen who had passed me early in the night and from whom I learned the distance to the river From these people I had gained intelligence which I considered of much value to me It was now certain that the whole country had been advised of my flight but it was equally certain that no one had any knowledge of the course I had taken nor of the point I was endeavouring to reach To prevent any one from acquiring a knowledge of my route was a primary object with me and I determined from this moment so to regulate my movements as to wrap my very existence in a veil of impenetrable secrecy After leaving the river one or two miles I turned aside from the road and wrung the water from my clothes which were all wet This occupied some time and after being again equipped for my journey I made all haste to gain as much distance this night as possible The fog extended only a few miles from the river and from the top of an eminence which I gained an hour after wringing my clothes the stars were distinctly visible Here I discovered that the road I was travelling bore nearly east and was not likely to take me to the Savannah river for a long time Nevertheless I travelled hard until daylight appeared before me which was my signal for turning into the woods and seeking a place of safety for the day The country in which I now was appeared high and dry without any swamps or low grounds in which an asylum might be found I therefore determined to go to the top of a hill that extended on my right for some distance either way The summit of this ridge was gained before there was enough of daylight to enable me to see objects clearly but as soon as a view of the place could be had I discovered that it was a thicket of pine trees and that the road which I had left led through a plantation that lay within sight the house and other buildings on which appeared to be such as I had before seen but I could not at once recollect where or at what time I had seen them Going to an open space in the thicket from which I could scan the plantation at leisure I became satisfied after the sun had risen and thrown his light upon the earth that this was no other than the residence of the gentleman who had so kindly entertained my master and me as we went to and returned from Savannah with the wagon I now remembered that this gentleman was the friend of my late master and that he had told me to come and see him if ever I passed this way again but I knew that he was a slave-holder and a planter and that when he gave me liberty to visit his plantation he expected that my visits would always be the visits of a slave and not the clandestine calls of a runaway negro It seemed to me that this gentleman was too benevolent a man to arrest and send me back to my cruel mistress and yet how could I expect or even hope that a cotton planter would see a runaway slave on his premises and not cause him to be taken up and sent home Failing to seize a runaway slave when he has him in his power is held to be one of the most dishounorable acts to which a southern planter can subject himself Nor should the people of the north be surprised at this Slaves are regarded in the south as the most precious of all earthly possessions and at the same time as a precarious and hazardous kind of property in the enjoyment of which the master is not safe The planters may well be compared to the inhabitants of a national frontier which is exposed to the inroads of hostile invading tribes Where all are in like danger and subject to like fears it is expected that all will be governed by like sentiments and act upon like principles I stood and looked at the house of this good planter for more than an hour after the sun had risen and saw all the movements which usually take place on a cotton plantation in the morning Long before the sun was up the overseer had proceeded to the field at the head of the hands the black women who attended to the cattle and milked the cows had gone to the cow-pen with their pails and the smoke ascended from the chimney of the kitchen before the doors of the great house were opened or any of the members of the family were seen abroad At length two young ladies opened the door and stood in the freshness of the morning air These were soon joined by a brother and at last I saw the gentleman himself leave the house and walk towards the stables that stood at some distance from the house on my left I think even now that it was a foolish resolution that emboldened me to show myself to this gentleman It was like throwing one's self in the way of a lion who is known sometimes to spare those whom he might destroy but I resolved to go and meet this planter at his stables and tell him my whole story Issuing from the woods I crossed the fields unperceived by the people at the house and going directly to the stables presented myself to then proprietor as he stood looking at a fine horse in one of the yards At first he did not know me and asked me whose man I was I then asked him if he did not remember me and named the time when I had been at his house I then told at once that I was a runaway that my master was dead and my mistress so cruel that I could not live with her not omitting to show the scars on my back and to give a full account of the manner in which they had been made The gentleman stood and looked at me more than a minute without uttering a word and then Charles I will not betray you but you must not stay here It must not be known that you were on this plantation and that I saw and conversed with you However as I suppose you are hungry you may go to the kitchen and get your breakfast with my house servants He then set off for the house and I followed but turning into the kitchen as he ordered me I was soon supplied with a good breakfast of cold meat warm bread and as much new butter-milk as I chose to drink Before I sat down to breakfast the lady of the house came into the kitchen with her two daughters and gave me a dram of peach brandy I drank this brandy and was very thankful for it but I am fully convinced now that it did me much more harm than good and that this part of the kindness of this most excellent family was altogether misplaced Whilst I was taking my breakfast a black man came into the kitchen and gave me a dollar that he his master had sent me at the same time laying on the table before me a package of bread and meat weighing at least ten pounds wrapped up in a cloth On delivering these things the black man told me that his master desired me to quit his premises as soon as I had finished my breakfast This injunction I obeyed and within less than an hour after I entered this truly hospitable house I quitted it forever but not without leaving behind me my holiest blessings upon the heads of its inhabitants It was yet early in the morning when I regained the woods on the opposite side of the plantation from that by which I had entered it XXI I could not believe it possible that the white people whom I had just left would give information of the route I had taken but as it was possible that all who dwelt on this plantation might not be so pure of heart as were they who possessed it I thought it prudent to travel some distance in the woods before I stopped for the day notwithstanding the risk of moving about in the open light For the purpose of precluding the possibility of being betrayed I now determined to quit this road and travel altogether in the woods or through open fields for two or three nights guiding my march by the stars In pursuance of this resolution I bore away to the left of the high road and travelled five or six miles before I stopped going round all the fields that I saw in my way and keeping them at a good distance from me In the afternoon of this day it rained and I had no other shelter than the boughs and leaves of a large magnolia tree but this kept me tolerably dry and as it cleared away in the evening I was able to continue my journey by starlight I have no definite idea of the distance that I travelled in the course of this and the two succeeding nights as I had no road to guide me and was much perplexed by the plantations and houses the latter of which I most carefully eschewed but on the third night after this I encountered a danger which was very nearly fatal to me At the time of which I now speak the moon having changed lately shone until about eleven o'clock I had been on my way two or three hours this evening and all the world seemed to be quiet when I entered a plantation that lay quite across my way In passing through these fields I at last saw the houses and other improvements and about a hundred yards from the house a peach orchard which I could distinguish by the faint light of the moon This orchard was but little out of my way and a quarter of a mile as nearly as I could judge from the woods I resolved to examine these peach trees and see what fruit was on them Coming amongst them I found the fruit of the kind called Indian peaches in Georgia These Indian peaches are much the largest and finest peaches that I have ever seen one of them oftentimes being as large as a common quince I had filled all my pockets and was filling my handkerchief with this delicious fruit which is of deep red when I heard the loud growl of a dog toward the house the roof of which I could see I stood as still as a stone but yet the dog growled on and at length barked out I presume he smelled me for he could not hear me In a short time I found that the dog was coming towards me and I then started and ran as fast as I could for the woods He now barked louder and was followed by another dog both making a terrible noise I was then pretty light of foot and was already close by the woods when the first dog overtook me I carried a good stick in my hand and with this I kept the dogs at bay until I gained the fence and escaped into the woods but now I heard the shouts of men encouraging the dogs both of which were now up with me and the men were coming as fast as they could The dogs would not permit me to run and unless I could make free use of my heels it was clear that I must be taken in a few minutes I now thought of my master's sword which I had not removed from its quilted scabbard in my great coat since I commenced my journey I snatched it from its sheath and at a single cut laid open the head of the largest and fiercest of the dogs from his neck to his nose He gave a loud yell and fell dead on the ground The other dog seeing the fate of his companion leaped the fence and escaped into the field where he stopped and like a cowardly cur set up a clamorous barking at the enemy he was afraid to look in the face I thought this no time to wait to ascertain what the men would say when they came to their dead dog but made the best of my way through the woods and did not stop to look behind me for more than an hour In my battle with the dogs I lost all my peaches except a few that remained in my pockets and in running through the woods I tore my clothes very badly a disaster not easily repaired in my situation but I had proved the solidity of my own judgment in putting up my sword as a part of my travelling equi I now considered it necessary to travel as fast as possible and get as far as I could before day from the late battle-ground and certainly I lost no time but from the occurrences of the next day I am of opinion that I had not continued in a straight line all night but that I must have travelled in a circular or zigzag route When a man is greatly alarmed and in a strange country he is not able to note courses or calculate distances very accurately Daylight made its appearance when I was moving to the south for the daybreak was on my left hand but I immediately stopped went into a thicket of low white oak bushes and lay down to rest myself for I was very weary and soon fell asleep and did not awake until it was ten or eleven o'clock Before I fell asleep I noted the course of the rising sun from the place where I lay in pursuance of a rule that I had established for by this means I could tell the time of day at any hour within a short period of time by taking the bearing of the sun in the heavens from where I lay and then comparing it with the place of his rising When I awoke to-day I felt hungry and after eating my breakfast again lay down but felt an unusual sense of disquietude and alarm It seemed to me that this was not a safe place to lie in although it looked as well as any other spot that I could see I rose and looked for a more secure retreat but not seeing any lay down again--still I was uneasy and could not lie still Finally I determined to get up and remove to the side of a large and long black log that lay at the distance of seventy or eighty yards from me I went to the log and lay down by it placing my bundle under my head with the intention of going to sleep again if I could but I had not been here more than fifteen or twenty minutes when I heard the noise of men's voices and soon after the tramping of horses on the ground I lay with my back to the log in such a position that I could see the place where I had been in the bushes I saw two dogs go into this little thicket and three horsemen rode over the very spot where I had lain when asleep in the morning and immediately horses and voices were at my back around me and over me Two horses jumped over the log by the side of which I lay one about ten feet from my feet and the other within two yards from my head The horses both saw me took fright and started to run but fortunately their riders who were probably looking for me in the tops of the trees or expecting to see me start before them in the woods and run for my life did not see me and attributed the alarm of their horses to the black appearance of the log for I heard one of them say--Our horses are afraid of black logs--I wonder how they would stand the sight of the negro if we should meet him There must have been in the troop at least twenty horsemen and the number of dogs was greater than I could count as they ran in the woods I knew that all these men and dogs were in search of me and that if they could find me I should be hunted down like a wild beast The dogs that had gone into the thicket where I had been fortunately for me had not been trained to hunt negroes in the woods and were probably brought out for the purpose of being trained Doubtless if some of the kept dogs as they are called of which there were certainly several in this large pack had happened to go into that thicket instead of those that did go there my race would soon have been run I lay still by the side of the log for a long time after the horses dogs and men had ceased to trouble the woods with their noise if it can be that a man lies still who is trembling in every joint nerve and muscle like a dog lying upon a cake of ice and when I arose and turned round I found myself so completely bereft of understanding that I could not tell south from north nor east from west I could not even distinguish the thicket of bushes from which I had removed to come to this place from the other bushes of the woods I remained here all day and at night it appeared to me that the sun set in the south-east After sundown the moon appeared to my distempered judgment to stand due north from me and all the stars were out of their places Fortunately I had sense enough remaining to know that it would not be safe for me to attempt to travel until my brain had been restored to its ordinary stability which did not take place until the third morning after my fright The three days that I passed in this place I reckon the most unhappy of my life for surely it is the height of human misery to be oppressed with alienation of mind and to be conscious of the affliction Distracted as I was I had determined never to quit this wood and voluntarily return to slavery and the joy I felt on the third morning when I saw the sun rise in his proper place in the heavens the black log the thicket of bushes and all other things resume the positions in which I found them may be imagined by those who have been saved from apparently hopeless shipwreck on a barren rock in the midst of the ocean but cannot be described by any but a poetic pen I spent this day in making short excursions through the woods for the purpose of ascertaining whether any road was near to me or not and in the afternoon I came to one about a mile from my camp which was broad and had the appearance of being much travelled It appeared to me to lead to the north Awhile before sundown I brought my bundle to this road and lay down quietly to await the approach of night When it was quite dark except the light of the moon which was now brilliant I took to this road and travelled all night without hearing or seeing any person and on the succeeding night about two o'clock in the morning I came to the margin of a river so wide that I could not see across it but the fog was so dense at this time that I could not have seen across a river of very moderate width I procured a long pole and sounded the depth of the water which I found not very deep but as I could not see the opposite shore was afraid to attempt to ford the stream In this dilemma I turned back from the river and went more than a mile to gain the cover of a small wood where I might pass the day in safety and wait a favourable moment for obtaining a view of the river preparatory to crossing it I lay all day in full view of the high road and saw at least a hundred people pass from which I inferred that the country was populous about me In the evening as soon as it was dark I left my retreat and returned to the river side The atmosphere was now clear and the river seemed to be at least a quarter of a mile in width and whilst I was divesting myself of my clothes preparatory to entering the water happening to look down the shore I saw a canoe with its head drawn high on the beach On reaching the canoe I found that it was secured to the trunk of a tree by a lock and chain but after many efforts I broke the lock and launched the canoe into the river The paddles had been removed but with the aid of my sounding-pole I managed to conduct the canoe across the water I was now once more in South Carolina where I knew it was necessary for me to be even more watchful than I had been in Georgia I do not know where I crossed the Savannah river but I think it must have been only a few miles above the town of Augusta After gaining the Carolina shore I took an observation of the rising moon and of such stars as I was acquainted with and hastened to get away from the river from which I knew that heavy fogs rose every night at this season of the year obscuring the heavens for many miles on either side I travelled this night at least twenty miles and provided myself with a supply of corn which was now hard from a field at the side of the road At daybreak I turned into the woods and went to the top of a hill on my left where the ground was overgrown by the species of pine-tree called spruce in the south I here kindled a fire and parched corn for my breakfast In the afternoon of this day the weather became cloudy and before dark the rain fell copiously and continued through the night with the wind high I took shelter under a large stooping tree that was decayed and hollow on the lower side and kept me dry until the morning When daylight appeared I could see that the country around me was well inhabited and that the forest in which I lay was surrounded by plantations at the distance of one or two miles from me I did not consider this a safe position and waited anxiously for night to enable me to change my quarters The weather was foul throughout the day and when night returned it was so dark that I could not see a large tree three feet before me Waiting until the moon rose I made my way back to the road but had not proceeded more than two or three miles on my way when I came to a place where the road forked and the two roads led away almost at right angles from each other It was so cloudy that I could not see the place of the moon in the heavens and I knew not which of these roads to take To go wrong was worse than to stand still and I therefore determined to look out for some spot in which I could hide myself and remain in this neighbourhood until the clearing up of the weather Taking the right hand road I followed its course until I saw at the distance as I computed it in the night of two miles from me a large forest which covered elevated ground I gained it by the shortest route across some cotton fields Going several hundred yards into this wood I attempted to kindle a fire in which I failed every combustible substance being wet This compelled me to pass the night as well as I could amongst the damp bushes and trees that overhung me When day came I went farther into the woods and on the top of the highest ground that I could see established my camp by cutting bushes with my knife and erecting a sort of rude booth It was now by my computation about the twenty-fifth of August and I remained here eleven days without seeing one clear night and in all this time the sun never shone for half a day at once I procured my subsistence while here from a field of corn which I discovered at the distance of a mile and a half from my camp This was the first time that I was weather-bound and my patience had been worn out and renewed repeatedly before the return of the clear weather but one afternoon I perceived the trees to be much agitated by the wind the clouds appeared high and were driven with velocity over my head I saw the clear sky appear in all its beauty in the northwest Before sundown the wind was high the sun shone in full splendour and a few fleecy clouds careering high in the upper vault of heaven gave assurance that the rains were over and gone At nightfall I returned to the forks of the road and after much observation finally concluded to follow the right hand road in which I am satisfied that I committed a great error Nothing worthy of notice occurred for several days after this As I was now in a thickly-peopled country I never moved until long after night and was cautious never to permit daylight to find me on the road but I observed that the north-star was always on my left hand My object was to reach the neighbourhood of Columbia and get upon the road which I had travelled and seen years before in coming to the south but the road I was now on must have been the great Charleston road leading down the country and not across the courses of the rivers So many people travelled this road as well by night as by day that my progress was very slow and in some of the nights I did not travel more than eight miles At the end of a week after leaving the forks I found myself in a flat sandy poor country and as I had not met with any river on this road I now concluded that I was on the way to the sea-board instead of Columbia In my perplexity I resolved to try to get information concerning the country I was in by placing myself in some obscure place in the side of the road and listening to the conversation of travellers as they passed me For this purpose I chose the corner of a cotton field around which the road turned and led along the fence for some distance Passing the day in the woods among the pine-trees I came to this corner in the evening and lying down within the field waited patiently the coming of travellers that I might hear their conversation and endeavour to learn from that which they the name at least of some place in this neighbourhood On the first and second evenings that I lay here I gleaned nothing from the passengers that I thought could be of service to me but on the third night about ten o'clock several wagons drawn by mules passed me and I heard one of the drivers call to another and tell him that it was sixty miles to Charleston and that they should be able to reach the river to-morrow I could not at first imagine what river this could be but another of the wagoners enquired how far it was to the Edisto to which it was replied by some one that it was near thirty miles I now perceived that I had mistaken my course and was as completely lost as a wild goose in cloudy weather Not knowing what to do I retraced the road that had led me to this place for several nights hoping that something would happen from which I might learn the route to Columbia but I gained no information that could avail me anything At length I determined to quit this road altogether travel by the north-star for two or three weeks and after that to trust to Providence to guide me to some road that might lead me back to Maryland Having turned my face due north I made my way pretty well for the first night but on the second the fog was so dense that no stars could be seen This compelled me to remain in my camp which I had pitched in a swamp In this place I remained more than a week waiting for clear nights but now the equinoctial storm came on and raged with a fury which I had never before witnessed in this annual gale at least it had never before appeared so violent to me because perhaps I had never been exposed to its blasts without the shelter of a house of some kind This storm continued four days and no wolf ever lay closer in his lair or moved out with more stealthy caution than I did during this time My subsistence was drawn from a small corn-field at the edge of the swamp in which I lay After the storm was over the weather became calm and clear and I fell into a road which appeared to run nearly north-west Following the course of this road by short marches because I was obliged to start late at night and stop before day I came on the first day or rather night of October by my calender to a broad and well-frequented road that crossed mine at nearly right angles These roads crossed in the middle of a plantation and I took to the right hand along this great road and pursued it in the same cautious and slow manner that I had travelled for the last month When the day came I took refuge in the woods as usual choosing the highest piece of ground that I could find in the neighbourhood No part of this country was very high but I thought people who visited these woods would be less inclined to walk to the tops of the hills than to keep their course along the low grounds I had lately crossed many small streams but on the second night of my journey on this road came to a narrow but deep river and after the most careful search no boat or craft of any kind could be found on my side A large flat with two or three canoes lay on the opposite side but they were as much out of my reach as if they had never been made There was no alternative but swimming this stream and I made the transit in less than three minutes carrying my packages on my back I had as yet fallen in with no considerable towns and whenever I had seen a house near the road or one of the small hamlets of the south in my way I had gone round by the woods or fields so as to avoid the inhabitants but on the fourth night after swimming the small river I came in sight of a considerable village with lights burning and shining through many of the windows I knew the danger of passing a town on account of the patrols with which all southern towns are provided and making a long circuit to the right so as totally to avoid this village I came to the banks of a broad river which upon further examination I found flowing past the village and near its border This compelled me to go back and attempt to turn the village on the left which was performed by wandering a long time in swamps and pine woods It was break of day when I regained the road beyond the village and returning to the swamps from which I had first issued I passed the day under their cover On the following night after regaining the road I soon found myself in a country almost entirely clear of timber and abounding in fields of cotton and corn The houses were numerous and the barking of dogs was incessant I felt that I was in the midst of dangers and that I was entering a region very different from those tracts of country though which I had lately passed where the gloom of the wilderness was only broken by solitary plantations or lonely huts I had no doubt that I was in the neighbourhood of some town but of its name and the part of the country in which it was located I was ignorant I at length found that I was receding from the woods altogether and entering a champaign country in the midst of which I now perceived a town of considerable magnitude the inhabitants of which were entirely silent and the town itself presented the appearance of total solitude The country around was so open that I despaired of turning so large a place as this was and again finding the road I travelled I therefore determined to risk all consequences and attempt to pass this town under cover of darkness Keeping straight forward I came unexpectedly to a broad river which I now saw running between me and the town I took it for granted that there must be a ferry at this place and on examining the shore found several small boats fastened only with ropes to a large scow One of these boats I seized and was quickly on the opposite shore of the river I entered the village and proceeded to its centre without seeing so much as a rat in motion Finding myself in an open space I stopped to examine the streets and upon looking at the houses around me I at once recognized the jail of Columbia and the tavern in which I had lodged on the night after I was sold This discovery made me feel almost at home with my wife and children I remembered the streets by which I had come from the country to the jail and was quickly at the extremity of the town marching towards the residence of the paltry planter at whose house I had lodged on my way south It was late at night when I left Columbia and it was necessary for me to make all speed and get as far as possible from that place before day I ran rather than walked until the appearance of dawn when I left the road and took shelter in the pine woods with which this part of the country abounds I had now been travelling almost two months and was still so near the place from which I first departed that I could easily have walked to it in a week by daylight but I hoped that as I was now on a road with which I was acquainted and in a country through which I had travelled before that my future progress would be more rapid and that I should be able to surmount without difficulty many of the obstacles that had hitherto embarrassed me so greatly It was now in my power to avail myself of the knowledge I had formerly acquired of the customs of South Carolina The patrol are very rigid in the execution of the authority with which they are invested but I never had much difficulty with these officers anywhere From dark until ten or eleven o'clock at night the patrol are watchful and always traversing the country in quest of negroes but towards midnight these gentlemen grow cold or sleepy or weary and generally betake themselves to some house where they can procure a comfortable fire I now established as a rule of my future conduct to remain in my hiding place until after ten o'clock according to my computation of time and this night I did not come to the road until I supposed it to be within an hour of midnight and it was well for me that I practised so much caution for when within two or three hundred yards of the road I heard people conversing After standing some minutes in the woods and listening to the voices at the road the people separated and a party took each end of the road and galloped away upon their horses These people were certainly a band of patrollers who were watching this road and had just separated to return home for the night After the horsemen were quite out of hearing I came to the road and walked as fast as I could for hours and again came into the lane leading to the house where I had first remained a few days in Carolina Turning away from the road I passed through this plantation near the old cotton-gin house in which I had formerly lodged and perceived that every thing on this plantation was nearly as it was when I left it Two or three miles from this place I again left the road and sought a place of concealment and from this time until I reached Maryland I never remained in the road until daylight but once and I paid dearly then for my temerity I was now in an open thickly-peopled country in comparison with many other tracts through which I had passed and this circumstance compelled me to observe the greater caution As nearly as possible I confined my travelling within the hours of midnight and three o'clock in the morning Parties of patrollers were heard by me almost every morning before day These people sometimes moved directly along the roads but more frequently lay in wait near the side of the road ready to pounce upon any runaway slave that might chance to pass but I knew by former experience that they never lay out all night except in times of apprehended danger and the country appearing at this time to be quiet I felt but little apprehension of falling in with these policemen within my travelling hours There was now plenty of corn in the fields and sweet potatoes had not yet been dug There was no scarcity of provisions with me and my health was good and my strength unimpaired For more than two weeks I pursued the road that had led me from Columbia believing I was on my way to Camden Many small streams crossed my way but none of them were large enough to oblige me to swim in crossing them XXII On the twenty-fourth of October according to my computation in a dark night I came to a river which appeared to be both broad and deep Sounding its depth with a pole I found it too deep to be forded and after the most careful search along the shore no boat could be discovered This place appeared altogether strange to me and I began to fear that I was again lost Confident that I had never before been where I now found myself and ignorant of the other side of the stream I thought it best not to attempt to cross this water until I was better informed of the country through which it flowed A thick wood bordered the road on my left and gave me shelter until daylight Ascending a tree at sunrise that overlooked the stream which appeared to be more than a mile in width I perceived on the opposite shore a house and one large and several small boats in the river I remained in this tree the greater part of the day and saw several persons cross the river some of whom had horses but in the evening the boats were all taken back to the place at which I had seen them in the morning The river was so broad that I felt some fear of failing in the attempt to swim it but seeing no prospect of procuring a boat to transport me I resolved to attempt the navigation as soon as it was dark About nine o'clock at night having equipped myself in the best manner I was able I undertook this hazardous navigation and succeeded in gaining the farther shore of the river in about an hour with all my things in safety On the previous day I had noted the bearing of the road as it led from the river and in the middle of the night I again resumed my journey in a state of perplexity bordering upon desperation for it was now evident that this was not the road by which we had travelled when we came to the southern country and on which hand to turn to reach the right way I knew not After travelling five or six miles on this road and having the north-star in view all the time I became satisfied that my course lay northwest and that I was consequently going out of my way and to heighten my anxiety I had not tasted any animal food since I crossed the Savannah river--a sensation of hunger harrassed me constantly but fortune which had been so long adverse to me and had led me so often astray had now a little favour in store for me The leaves were already fallen from some of the more tender trees and near the road I this night perceived a persimmon tree well laden with fruit and whilst gathering the fallen persimmons under the tree a noise over head arrested my attention This noise was caused by a large opossum which was on the tree gathering fruit like myself With a long stick the animal was brought to the ground and it proved to be very fat weighing at least ten pounds With such a luxury as this in my possession I could not think of travelling far without tasting it and accordingly halted about a mile from the persimmon tree on a rising ground in a thick wood where I killed my opossum and took off its skin a circumstance that I much regretted for with the skin I took at least a pound of fine fat Had I possessed the means of scalding my game and dressing it like a pig it would have afforded me provision for a week but as it was I made a large fire and roasted my prize before it losing all the oil that ran out in the operation for want of a dripping-pan to catch it It was daylight when my meat was ready for the table and a very sumptuous breakfast it yielded me Since leaving Columbia I had followed as nearly as the course of the roads permitted the index of the north-star which I supposed would lead me on the most direct route to Maryland but I now became convinced that this star was leading me away from the line by which I had approached the cotton country I slept none this day but passed the whole time from breakfast until night in considering the means of regaining my lost way From the aspect of the country I arrived at the conclusion that I was not near the sea-coast for there were no swamps in all this region the land lay rather high and rolling and oak timber abounded At the return of night I resumed my journey earlier than usual paying no regard to the roads but keeping the north-star on my left hand as nearly as I could This night I killed a rabbit which had leaped from the bushes before me by throwing my walking stick at it It was roasted at my stopping place in the morning and was very good I pursued the same course keeping the north-star on my left hand for three nights intending to get as far east as the road leading from Columbia to Richmond in Virginia but as my line of march lay almost continually in the woods I made but little progress and on the third day the weather became cloudy so that I could not see the stars This again compelled me to lie by until the return of fair weather On the second day after I had stopped this time the sun shone out bright in the morning and continued to shed a glorious light during the day but in the evening the heavens became overcast with clouds and the night that followed was so dark that I did not attempt to travel This state of the weather continued more than a week obliging me to remain stationary all this time These cloudy nights were succeeded by a brisk wind from the north-west accompanied by fine clear nights in which I made the best of my way towards the north-east pursuing my course across the country without regard to roads forests or streams of water crossing many of the latter none of which were deep but some of them were extremely muddy One night I became entangled in a thick and deep swamp the trees that grew in which were so tall and stood so close together that the interlocking of their boughs and the deep foliage in which the were clad prevented me from seeing the stars Wandering there for several hours most of the time with mud and water over my knees and frequently wading in stagnant pools with deep slimy bottoms I became totally lost and was incapable of seeing the least appearance of fast land At length giving up all hope of extricating from this abyss of mud water brambles and fallen timber I scrambled on a large tussock and sat down to await the coming of day with the intention of going to the nearest high land as soon as the sun should be up The nights were now becoming cool and though I did not see any frost in the swamp where I was in the morning I have no doubt that hoar frost was seen in the dry and open country After daylight I found myself as much perplexed as I was at midnight No shore was to be seen and in every direction there was the same deep dreary black solitude To add to my misfortune the morning proved cloudly and when the sun was up I could not tell the east from the west After waiting several hours for a sight of the sun and failing to obtain it I set out in search of a running stream of water intending to strike off at right angels with the course of the current and endeavour to reach the dry ground by this means but after wandering about through tangled bushes briars and vines clambering over fallen tree-tops and wading through fens overgrown with saw grass for two or three hours I sat down in despair of finding any guide to conduct me from this detestable place My bag of meal that I took with me at the commencement of my journey was long since gone and the only provisions that I now possessed were a few grains of parched corn and near a pint of chestnuts that I had picked up under a tree the day before I entered the swamp The chestnut-tree was full of nuts but I was afraid to throw sticks or to shake the tree lest hunters or other persons hearing the noise might be drawn to the place About ten o'clock I sat down under a large cypress tree upon a decaying log of the same timber to make my breakfast on a few grains of parched corn Near me was an open space without trees but filled with water that seemed to be deep for no grass grew in it except a small quantity near the shore The water was on my left hand and as I sat cracking my corn my attention was attracted by the playful gambols of two squirrels that were running and chasing each other on the boughs of some trees near me Half pleased with the joyous movements of the little animals and half covetous of their carcasses to roast and devour them I paid no attention to a succession of sounds on my left which I thought proceeded from the movement of frogs at the edge of the water until the breaking of a stick near me caused me to turn my head when I discovered that I had other neighbours than spring-frogs A monstrous alligator had left the water and was crawling over the mud with his eyes fixed upon me He was now within fifteen feet of me and in a moment more if he had not broken the stick with his weight I should have become his prey He could easily have knocked me down with a blow of his tail and if his jaws had once been closed on a leg or an arm he would have dragged me into the water spite of any resistance that I could have made At the sight of him I sprang to my feet and running to the other end of the fallen tree on which I sat and being there out of danger had an opportunity of viewing the motions of the alligator at leisure Finding me out of his reach he raised his trunk from the ground elevated his snout and gave a wistful look the import of which I well understood then turning slowly round he retreated to the water and sank from my vision I was much alarmed by this adventure with the alligator for had I fallen in with this huge reptile in the night-time I should have had no chance of escape from his tusks The whole day was spent in the swamp not in travelling from place to place but in waking for the sun to shine to enable me to obtain a knowledge of the various points of the heavens The day was succeeded by a night of unbroken darkness and it was late in the evening of the second day before I saw the sun It being then too late to attempt to extricate myself from the swamp for that day I was obliged to pass another night in the lodge that I had formed for myself in the thick boughs of a fallen cypress tree which elevated me several feet from the ground where I believed the alligator could not reach me if he should come in pursuit of me On the morning of the third day the sun rose beautifully clear and at sight of him I set off for the east It must have been five miles from the place where I lay to the dry land on the east of the swamp for with all the exertion that fear and hunger compelled me to make it was two or three o'clock in the afternoon when I reached the shore after swimming in several places and suffering the loss of a very valuable part of my clothes which were torn off by the briars and snags On coming to high ground I found myself in the woods and hungry as I was lay down to await the coming of night lest some one should see me moving through the forest in daylight When night came on I resumed my journey by the stars which were visible and marched several miles before coming to a plantation The first that I came to was a cotton field and after much search I found no corn nor grain of any kind on this place and was compelled to continue on my way Two or three miles further on I was more fortunate and found a field of corn which had been gathered from the stalks and thrown in heaps along the ground Filling my little bag which I still kept with this corn I retreated a mile or two in the woods and striking fire encamped for the purpose of parching and eating it After despatching my meal I lay down beside the fire and fell into a sound sleep from which I did not awake until long after sunrise but on rising and looking around me I found that my lodge was within less than a hundred yards of a new house that people were building in the woods and upon which men were now at work Dropping instantly to the ground I crawled away through the woods until being out of sight of the house I ventured to rise and escape on my feet After I lay down in the night my fire had died away and emitted no smoke this circumstance saved me This affair made me more cautious as to my future conduct Hiding in the woods until night again came on I continued my course eastward and some time after midnight came upon a wide well beaten road one end of which led at this place a little to the left of the north-star which I could plainly see Here I deliberated a long time whether to take this road or continue my course across the country by the stars but at last resolved to follow the road more from a desire to get out of the woods than from a conviction that it would lead me in the right way In the course of this night I saw but few plantations but was so fortunate as to see a ground-hog crossing the road before me This animal I killed with my stick and carried it until morning At the approach of daylight turning away to the right I gained the top of an eminence from which I could see through the woods for some distance around me Here I kindled a fire and roasted my ground-hog which afforded me a most grateful repast after my late fasting and severe toils According to custom my meal being over I betook myself to sleep and did not awake until the afternoon when descending a few rods down the hill and standing still to take a survey of the woods around me I saw at the distance of half a mile from me a man moving slowly about in the forest and apparently watching like myself to see if any one was in view Looking at this man attentively I saw that he was a black and that he did not move more than a few rods from the same spot where I first saw him Curiosity impelled me to know more of the condition of my neighbour and descending quite to the foot of the hill I perceived that he had a covert of boughs of trees under which I saw him pass and after some time return again from his retreat Examining the appearance of things carefully I became satisfied that the stranger was like myself a negro slave and I determined without more ceremony to go and speak to him for I felt no fear of being betrayed by one as badly off in the world as myself When this man first saw me at the distance of a hundred yards from him he manifested great agitation and at once seemed disposed to run from me but when I called to him and told him not to be afraid he became more assured and waited for me to come close to him I found him to be a dark mulatto small and slender in person and lame in one leg He had been well bred and possessed good manners and fine address I told him I was travelling and presumed this was not his dwelling place Upon which he informed me that he was a native of Kent county in the state of Delaware and had been brought up as a house-servant by his master who on his death-bed had made his will and directed him to be set free by his executors at the age of twenty-five and that in the meantime he would be hired out as a servant to some person who should treat him well Soon after the death of his master the executors hired him to a man in Wilmington who employed him as a waiter in his house for three or four months and then took him to a small town called Newport and sold him to a man who took him immediately to Baltimore where he was again sold or transferred to another man who brought him to South Carolina and sold him to a cotton planter with whom he had lived more than two years and had run away three weeks before the time I saw him with the intention of returning to Delaware That being lame and becoming fatigued by travelling he had stopped here and made this shelter of boughs and bark of trees under which he had remained more than a week before I met him He invited me to go into his camp as he termed it where he had an old skillet more than a bushel of potatoes and several fowls all of which he he had purloined from the plantations in the neighbourhood This encampment was in a level open wood and it appeared surprising to me that its occupant had not been discovered and conveyed back to his master before this time I told him that I thought he ran great risk of being taken up by remaining here and advised him to break up his lodge immediately and pursue his journey travelling only in the night time He then proposed to join me and travel in company with me but this I declined because of his lameness and great want of discretion though I did not assign these reasons to him I remained with this man two or three hours and ate dinner of fowls dressed after his rude fashion Before leaving him I pressed upon him the necessity of immediately quitting the position he then occupied but he he intended to remain there a few days longer unless I would take him with me On quitting my new acquaintance I thought it prudent to change my place of abode for the residue of this day and removed along the top of the hill that I occupied at least two miles and concealed myself in a thicket until night when returning to the road I had left in the morning and travelling hard all night I came to a large stream of water just at the break of day As it was too late to pass the river with safety this morning at this ford I went half a mile higher and swam across the stream in open daylight at a place where both sides of the water were skirted with woods I had several large potatoes that had been given to me by the man at his camp in the woods and these constituted my rations for this day At the rising and setting of the sun I took the bearing of the road by the course of the stream I that I had crossed and found that I was travelling to the northwest instead of the north or northeast to one of which latter points I wished to direct my march Having perceived the country in which I now was to be thickly peopled I remained in my resting place until late at night when returning to the road and crossing it I took once more to the woods with the stars for my guides and steered for the northeast This was a fortunate night for me in all respects The atmosphere was clear the ground was high dry and free from thickets In the course of the night I passed several corn fields with the corn still remaining in them and passed a potato lot in which large quantities of fine potatoes were dug out of the ground and lay in heaps covered with vines but my most signal good luck occurred just before day when passing under a dog-wood tree and hearing a noise in the branches above me I looked up and saw a large opossum amongst the berries that hung upon the boughs The game was quickly shaken down and turned out as fat as a well-fed pig and as heavy as a full-grown rackoon My attention was now turned to searching for a place in which I could secrete myself for the day and dress my provisions in quietness This day was dear and beautiful until the afternoon when the air became damp and the heavens were overhung with clouds The night that followed was dark as pitch compelling me to remain in my camp all night The next day brought with it a terrible storm of rain and wind that continued with but little intermission more than twenty- four hours and the sun was not again visible until the third day nor was there a clear night for more than a week During all this time I lay in my camp and subsisted upon the provisions that I had brought with me to this place The corn and potatoes looked so tempting when I saw them in the fields that I had taken more than I should have consumed had not the bad weather compelled me to remain at this spot but it was well for me for this time that I had taken more than I could eat in one or two days At the end of the cloudy weather I felt much refreshed and strengthened and resumed my journey in high spirits although I now began to feel the want of shoes--those which I wore when I left my mistress having long since been worn out and my boots were now beginning to fail so much that I was obliged to wrap straps of hickory bark about my feet to keep the leather from separating and falling to pieces It was now by my computation the month of November and I was yet in the state of South Carolina I began to consider with myself whether I had gamed or lost by attempting to travel on the roads and after revolving in my mind all the disasters that had befallen me determined to abandon the roads altogether for two reasons-- the first of which was that on the highways I was constantly liable to meet persons or to be overtaken by them and a second no less powerful was that as I did not know what roads to pursue I was oftener travelling on the wrong route than on the right one Setting my face once more for the north-star I advanced with a steady though slow pace for four or five nights when I was again delayed by dark weather and forced to remain in idleness nearly two weeks and when the weather again became clear I was arrested on the second night by a broad and rapid river that appeared so formidable that I did not dare to attempt its passage until after examining it in daylight On the succeeding night however I crossed it by swimming--resting at some large rocks near the middle After gaining the north side of this river which I believed to be the Catawba I considered myself in North Carolina and again steered towards the north XXIII The month of November is in all years a season of clouds and vapours but at the time of which I write the good weather vanished early in the month and all the clouds of the universe seemed to have collected in North Carolina From the second night after crossing the Catawba I did not see the north-star for the space of three weeks and during all this time no progress was made in my journey although I seldom remained two days in the same place but moved from one position to another for the purpose of eluding the observation of the people of the country whose attention might have been attracted by the continual appearance of the smoke of my fires in one place There had as yet been no hard frost and the leaves were still on the oak trees at the close of this cloudy weather but the northwest wind which dispelled the mist also brought down nearly all the leaves of the forest except those of the evergreen trees and the nights now became clear and the air keen with frost Hitherto the oak woods had afforded me the safest shelter but now I was obliged to seek for groves of young pines to retire to at dawn Heretofore I had found a plentiful subsistence in every corn-field and potato-lot that fell in my way but now began to find some of the fields in which corn had grown destitute of the corn and containing nothing but the stalks The potatoes had all been taken out of the lots where they grew except in some few instances where they had been buried in the field and the means of subsistence became every day more difficult to be obtained but as I had fine weather I made the best use of those hours in which I dared to travel and was constantly moving from a short time after dark until daylight The toil that I underwent for the first half of the month of December was excessive and my sufferings for want of food were great I was obliged to carry with me a stock of corn sufficient to supply me for two or three days for it frequently happened that I met with none in the fields for a long time In the course of this period I crossed innumerable streams the greater portion of which were of small size but some were of considerable magnitude and in all of them the water had become almost as cold as ice Sometimes I was fortunate enough to find boats or canoes tied at the side of the streams and when this happened I always made free use of that which no one else was using at the time but this did not occur often and I believe that in these two weeks I swam over nine rivers or streams so deep that I could not ford them The number of creeks and rivulets through which I waded was far greater but I cannot now fix the number In one of these fine nights passing near the house of a planter I saw several dry hides hanging on poles under a shed One of these hides I appropriated to myself for the purpose of converting it into moccasins to supply the place of my boots which were totally worthless By beating the dry hide with a stick it was made sufficiently pliable to bear making it into moccasins of which I made for myself three pair wearing one and carrying the others on my back One day as I lay in a pine thicket several pigs which appeared to be wild having no marks on their ears came near me and one of them approached so close without seeing me that I knocked it down with a stone and succeeded in killing it This pig was very fat and would have weighed thirty if not forty pounds Feeling now greatly exhausted with the fatigues that I had lately undergone and being in a very great forest far removed from white inhabitants I resolved to remain a few days in this place to regale myself with the flesh of the pig which I preserved by hanging it up in the shade after cutting it into pieces Fortune so adverse to me heretofore seemed to have been more kind to me at this time for the very night succeeding the day on which I killed the pig a storm of hail snow and sleet came on and continued fifteen or sixteen hours The snow lay on the ground four inches in depth and the whole country was covered with a crust almost hard enough to bear a man In this state of the weather I could not travel and my stock of pork was invaluable to me The pork was frozen where it hung on the branches of the trees and was as well preserved as if it had been buried in snow but on the fourth day after the snow fell the atmosphere underwent a great change The wind blew from the south the snow melted away the air became warm and the sun shone with the brightness and almost with the warmth of spring It was manifest that my pork which was now soft and oily would not long be in a sound state If I remained here my provisions would become putrid on my hands in a short time and compel me to quit my residence to avoid the atmosphere of the place I resolved to pursue my journey and prepared myself by roasting before the fire all my pork that was left wrapping it up carefully in green pine leaves and enveloping the whole in a sort of close basket that I made of small boughs of trees Equipping myself for my journey with my meat in my knapsack I again took to the woods with the stars for my guide keeping the north-star over my left eye The weather had now become exceedingly variable and I was seldom able to travel more than half of the night The fields were muddy the low grounds in the woods were wet and often covered with water through which I was obliged to wade--the air was damp and cold by day the nights were frosty very often covering the water with ice an inch in thickness From the great degree of cold that prevailed I inferred either that I was pretty far north or that I had advanced too much to the left and was approaching the mountain country To satisfy myself as far as possible of my situation one fair day when the sky was very clear I climbed to the top of a pine-tree that stood on the summit of a hill and took a wide survey of the region around me Eastward I saw nothing but a continuation of plantations intervened by forests on the south the faint beams of a winter sun shed a soft lustre over the woods which were dotted at remote distances with the habitations of men and the openings that they had made in the green champion of the endless pine-groves that nature had planted in the direction of the midday sun On the north at a great distance I saw a tract of low and flat country which in my opinion was the vale of some great river and beyond this at the farthest stretch of vision the eye was lost in the blue transparent vault where the extremity of the arch of the world touches the abode of perpetual winter Turning westward the view passed beyond the region of pine-trees which was followed afar off by naked and leafless oaks hickories and walnuts and still beyond these rose high in air elevated tracts of country clad in the white livery of snow and bearing the impress of mid-winter It was now apparent that I had borne too far west and was within a few days travel of the mountains Descending from my observations I determined on the return of night to shape my course for the future nearly due east until I should at least be out of the mountains According to my calendar it was the day before Christmas that I ascended the pine-tree and I believe I was at that time in the north-western part of North Carolina not far from the banks of the Yadkin river On the following night I travelled from dark until as I supposed about three or four o'clock in the morning when I came to a road which led as I thought in an easterly direction This road I travelled until daylight and encamped near it in an old field overgrown with young pines and holly-trees This was Christmas-day and I celebrated it by breakfasting on fat pork without salt and substituted parched corn for bread In the evening the weather became cloudy and cold and when night came it was so dark that I found difficulty in keeping in the road at some points where it made short angles Before midnight it began to snow and at break of day the snow lay more than a foot deep This compelled me to seek winter quarters and fortunately at about half a mile from the road I found on the side of a steep hill a shelving rock that formed a dry covert with a southern prospect Under this rock I took refuge and kindling a fire of dry sticks considered myself happy to possess a few pounds of my roasted pork and more than half a gallon of corn that I carried in my pockets The snow continued falling until it was full two feet deep around me and the danger of exposing myself to discovery by my tracks in the snow compelled me to keep close to my hiding place until the third day when I ventured to go back to the road which I found broken by the passage of numerous wagons sleds and horses and so much beaten that I could travel it with ease at night the snow affording good light Accordingly at night I again advanced on my way which indeed I was obliged to do for my corn was quite gone and not more than a pound of my pork remained to me I travelled hard through the night and after the morning star rose came to a river which I think must have been the Yadkin It appeared to be about two hundred yards wide and the water ran with great rapidity in it Waiting until the eastern horizon was tinged with the first rays of the morning light I entered the river at the ford and waded until the water was nearly three feet deep when it felt as if it was cutting the flesh from the bones of my limbs and a large cake of ice floating downward forced me off my balance and I was near falling My courage failed me and I returned to the shore but found the pain that already tormented me greatly increased when I was out of the water and exposed to the action of the open air Returning to the river I plunged into the current to relieve me from the pinching frost that gnawed every part of my skin that had become wet and rushing forward as fast as the weight of the water that pressed me downward would permit was soon up to my chin in melted ice when rising to the surface I exerted my utmost strength and skill to gain the opposite shore by swimming in the shortest space of time At every stroke of my arms and legs they were cut and bruised by cakes of solid ice or weighed down by floating masses of congealed snow It is impossible for human life to be long sustained in such an element as that which encompassed me and I had not been afloat five minutes before felt chilled in all my members and in less than the double of that time my limbs felt numbed and my hands became stiff and almost powerless When at the distance of thirty feet front the shore my body was struck by a violent current produced by a projecting rock above me and driven with resistless violence down the stream Wholly unable to contend with the fury of the waves and penetrated by the coldness of death in my most vitals I gave myself up for lost and was commending my soul to God whom I expected to be my immediate judge when I perceived the long hanging branch of a large tree sweeping to and fro and undulating backward and forward as its extremities were washed by the surging current of the river just below me In a moment I was in contact with the tree and making the effort of despair seized one of its limbs Bowed down by the weight of my body the branch yielded to the power of the water which rushing against my person swept me round like the quadrant of a circle and dashed me against the shore where clinging to some roots that grew near the bank the limb of the tree left me and springing with elastic force to its former position again dipped its slender branches in the mad stream Crawling out of the water and being once more on dry land I found my circumstances little less desperate than when I was struggling with the floating ice The morning was frosty and icicles hung in long pendant groups from the trees along the shore of the river and the hoar frost glistened in sparkling radiance upon the polished surface of the smooth snow as it whitened all the plain before me and spread its chill but beautiful covering through the woods There were three alternatives before me one of which I knew must quickly be adopted The one was to obtain a fire by which I could dry and warm my stiffened limbs the second was to die without the fire the third to go to the first house if I could reach one and surrender myself as a runaway slave Staggering rather than walking forward until I gained the cover of a wood at a short distance from the river I turned into it and found that a field bordered the wood within less than twenty rods of the road Within a few yards of this fence I stopped and taking out my fire apparatus to my unspeakable joy found them dry and in perfect safety With the aid of my spunk and some dry moss gathered from the fence a small flame was obtained to which dry leaves being added from the boughs of a white oak tree that had fallen before the frost of the last autumn had commenced I soon had fire of sufficient intensity to consume dry wood with which I supplied it partly from the fence and partly from the branches of the fallen tree Having raked away the snow from about the fire by the time the sun was up my frozen clothes were smoking before the coals--warming first one side and then the other-- I felt the glow of returning life once more invigorating my blood and giving animation to my frozen limbs The public road was near me on one hand and an enclosed field was before me on the other but in my present condition it was impossible for me to leave this place to-day without danger of perishing in the woods or of being arrested on the road As evening came on the air became much colder than it was in the forenoon and after night the wind rose high and blew from the northwest with intense keenness My limbs were yet stiff from the effects of my morning adventure and to complete my distress I was totally without provisions having left a few ears of corn that I had in my pocket on the other side of the river Leaving my fire in the night and advancing into the field near me I discovered a house at some distance and as there was no light or sign of fire about it I determined to reconnoitre the premises which turned out to be a small barn standing alone with no other inhabitants about it than a few cattle and a flock of sheep After much trouble I succeeded in entering the barn by starting the nails that confined one of the boards at the corner Entering the house I found it nearly filled with corn in the husks and some from which the husks had been removed was lying in a heap in one corner Into these husks I crawled and covering myself deeply under them soon became warm and fell into a profound sleep from which I was awakened by the noise of people walking about in the barn and talking of the cattle and sheep which it appeared they had come to feed for they soon commenced working in the corn husks with which I was covered and throwing them out to the cattle I expected at every moment that they would uncover me but fortunately before they saw me they ceased their operations and went to work some husking corn and throwing the husks on the pile over me while others were employed in loading the husked corn into carts as I learned by their conversation and hauling it away to the house The people continued working in the barn all day and in the evening gave more husks to the cattle and went home Waiting two or three hours after my visiters were gone I rose from the pile of husks and filling my pockets with ears of corn issued from the barn at the same place by which I had entered it and retired to the woods where I kindled a fire in a pine thicket and parched more than half a gallon of corn Before day I returned to the barn and again secreted myself in the corn husks In the morning the people again returned to their work and husked corn until the evening At night I again repaired to the woods and parched more corn In this manner I passed more than a month lying in the barn all day and going to the woods at night but at length the corn was all husked and I watched daily the progress that was made in feeding the cattle with the husks knowing that I must quit my winter retreat before the husks were exhausted Before the husked corn was removed from the barn I had conveyed several bushels of the ears into the husks near my bed and concealed them for my winter's stock Whilst I lay in this barn there were frequent and great changes of weather The snow that covered the earth to the depth of two feet when I came here did not remain more than ten days and was succeeded by more than a week of warm rainy weather which was in turn succeeded by several days of dry weather with cold high winds from the north The month of February was cloudy and damp with several squalls of snow and frequent rains About the first of March the atmosphere became clear and dry and the winds boisterous from the west On the third of this month having filled my little bag and all my pockets with parched corn I quitted my winter quarters about ten o'clock at night and again proceeded on my way to the north leaving a large heap of corn husks still lying in the corner of the barn On leaving this place I again pursued the road that had led me to it for several nights crossing many small streams in my way all of which I was able to pass without swimming though several of them were so deep that they wet me as high as my arm-pits This road led nearly northeast and was the only road that I had fallen in with since I left Georgia that had maintained that direction for so great a distance Nothing extraordinary befell me until the twelfth of March when venturing to turn out earlier than usual in the evening and proceeding along the road I found that my way led me down a hill along the side of which the road had been cut into the earth ten or twelve feet in depth having steep banks on each side which were now so damp and slippery that it was impossible for a man to ascend either the one or the other Whilst in this narrow place I heard the sound of horses proceeding up the hill to meet me Stopping to listen in a moment almost two horsemen were close before me trotting up the road To escape on either hand was impossible and to retreat backwards would have exposed me to certain destruction Only one means of salvation was left and I embraced it Near the place where I stood was a deep gully cut in one side of the road by the water which had run down here in time of rains Into this gully I threw myself and lying down close to the ground the horsemen rode almost over me and passed on When they were gone I arose and descending the hill found a river before me In crossing this stream I was compelled to swim at least two hundred yards and found the cold so oppressive after coming out of the water that I was forced to stop at the first thick woods that I could find and make a fire to city myself I did not move again until the next night and on the fourth night after this came to a great river which I suppose was the Roanoke I was obliged to swim this stream and was carried a great way down by the rapidity of the current It must have been more than an hour from the time that I entered the water until I reached the opposite shore and as the rivers were yet very cold I suffered greatly at this place Judging by the aspect of the country I believed myself to be at this time in Virginia and was now reduced to the utmost extremity for want of provisions The corn that I had parched at the barn and brought with me was nearly exhausted and no more was to be obtained in the fields at this season of the year For three or four days I allowed myself only my two hands full of parched corn per day after this I travelled three days without tasting food of any kind but being nearly exhausted with hunger I one night entered an old stack-yard hoping that I might fall in with pigs or poultry of some kind I found instead of these a stack of oats which had not been threshed From this stack I took as much oats in the sheaf as I could carry and going on a few miles stopped in a pine forest made a large fire and parched at least half a gallon of oats after rubbing the grain from the straw After the grain was parched I again rubbed it in my hands to separate it from the husks and spent the night in feasting on parched oats The weather was now becoming quite warm though the water was cold in the rivers and I perceived the farmers had everywhere ploughed their fields preparatory to planting corn Every night I saw people burning brush in the new grounds that they were clearing of the wood and brush and when the day came in the morning after I obtained the oats I perceived people planting corn in a field about half a mile from my fire According to my computation of time it was on the night of the last day of March that I obtained the oats and the appearance of the country satisfied me that I had not lost many days in my reckoning I lay in this pine-wood two days for the purpose of recruiting my strength after my long fast and when I again resumed my journey determined to seek some large road leading towards the north and follow it in future the one that I had been pursuing of late not appearing to be a principal high-way of the country For this purpose striking off across the fields in an easterly direction I travelled a few hours and was fortunate enough to come to a great road which was manifestly much travelled leading towards the northeast My bag was now replenished with more than a gallon of parched oats and I had yet one pair of moccasins made of raw hide but my shirt was totally gone and my last pair of trousers was now in actual service A tolerable waistcoat still remained to me and my great coat though full of honourable scars was yet capable of much service Having resolved to pursue the road I was now in it was necessary again to resort to the utmost degree of caution to prevent surprise Travelling only after it was dark and taking care to stop before the appearance of day my progress was not rapid but my safety was preserved The acquisition of food had now become difficult and when my oats began to fail I resorted to the dangerous expedient of attacking the corn-crib of a planter that was near the road The house was built of round logs and was covered with boards One of these boards I succeeded in removing on the side of the crib opposite from the dwelling and by thrusting my arm downwards was able to reach the corn--of which I took as much as filled my bag the pockets of my great coat and a large handkerchief that I had preserved through all the vicissitudes of my journey This opportune supply of corn furnished me with food more than a week and before it was consumed I reached the Appomattox river which I crossed in a canoe that I tied at the shore a few miles above the town of Petersburg Having approached Petersburg in the night I was afraid to attempt to pass through it lest the patrol should fall in with me and turning to left through the country reached the river and crossed in safety The great road leading to Richmond is so distinguishingly marked above the other ways in this part of Virginia that there was no difficulty in following it and on the third night after passing Petersburg I obtained a sight of the capitol of Virginia It was only a little after midnight when the city presented itself to my sight but here as well as at Petersburg I was afraid to attempt to go through the town under cover of the darkness because of the patrol Turning therefore back into a forest about two miles from the small town on the south-side of the river I lay there until after twelve o'clock in the day when loosening the package from my back and taking it in my hand in the form of a bundle I advanced into the village as if I had only come from plantation in the neighbourhood This was on Sunday I believe though according to my computation it was Monday but it must have been Sunday for the village was quiet and in passing it I only saw two or three persons whom I passed as if I had not seen them No one spoke to me and I gained the bridge in safety and crossed it without attracting the least attention Entering the city of Richmond I kept along the principal street walking at a slow pace and turning my head from side to side as if much attracted by the objects around me Few persons were in the street and I was careful to appear more attentive to the houses than to the people At the upper end of the city I saw a great crowd of ladies and gentlemen who were I believe returning from church Whilst these people were passing me I stood in the street on the outside of the foot pavement with my face turned to the opposite side of the street They all went by without taking any notice of me and when they were gone I again resumed my leisure walk along the pavement and reached the utmost limit of the town without being accosted by any one As soon as I was clear of the city I quickened my pace assumed the air of a man in great haste sometimes actually ran and in less than an hour was safely lodged in the thickest part of the woods that lay on the north of Richmond and full four miles from the river This was the boldest exploit that I had performed since leaving my mistress except the visit I paid to the gentleman in Georgia My corn was now failing but as I had once entered a crib secretly I felt but little apprehension on account of future supplies After this time I never wanted corn and did not again suffer by hunger until I reached the place of my nativity After leaving Richmond I again kept along the great road by which I had travelled on my way south taking great care not to expose my person unnecessarily For several nights I saw no white people on the way but was often met by black ones whom I avoided by turning out of the road but one moonlight night five or six days after I left Richmond a man stepped out of the woods almost at my side and accosting me in a familiar manner asked me which way I was travelling how long I had been on the road and made many inquiries concerning the course of my late journey This man was a mulatto and carried a heavy cane or rather club in his hand I did not like his appearance and the idea of a familiar conversation with any one seemed to terrify me I determined to watch my companion closely and he appeared equally intent on observing me but at the same time that he talked with me he was constantly drawing closer to and following behind me This conduct increased my suspicion and I began to wish to get rid of him but could not at the moment imagine how I should effect my purpose To avoid him I crossed the road several times but still he followed me closely The moon which shone brightly upon our backs cast his shadow far before me and enabled me to perceive his motions with the utmost accuracy without turning my head towards him He carried his club under his left arm and at length raised his right hand gently took the stick by the end and drawing it slowly over his head was in the very act of striking a blow at me when springing backward and raising my own staff at the same moment I brought him to the ground by a stroke on his forehead and when I had him down beat him over the back and sides with my weapon until he roared for mercy and begged me not to kill him I left him in no condition to pursue me and hastened on my way resolved to get as far from him before day as my legs would carry me This man was undoubtedly one of those wretches who are employed by white men to kidnap and betray such unfortunate people of colour as may chance to fall into their hands but for once the deceiver was deceived and he who intended to make prey of me had well nigh fallen a sacrifice himself The same night I crossed the Pammunky river near the village of Hanover by swimming and secreted myself before day in a dense cedar thicket The next night after I had travelled several miles in ascending a hill I saw the head of a man rise on the opposite side without having heard any noise I instantly ran into the woods and concealed myself behind a large tree The traveller was on horseback and the road being sandy and his horse moving only at a walk I had not heard his approach until I saw him He also saw me for when he came opposite the place where I stood he stopped his horse in the road and desired me to tell him how far it was to some place the name of which I have forgotten As I made no answer he again repeated the inquiry and then I need not be afraid to speak as he did not wish to hurt me but no answer being given him he at last I might as well speak and rode on Before day I reached the Matapony river and crossed it by wading but knowing that I was not far from Maryland I fell into a great indiscretion and forgot the wariness and caution that had enabled me to overcome obstacles apparently insurmountable Anxious to get forward I neglected to conceal myself before day but travelled until daybreak before I sought a place of concealment and unfortunately when I looked for a hiding place none was at hand This compelled me to keep on the road until gray twilight for the purpose of reaching a wood that was in view before me but to gain this wood I was obliged to pass a house that stood at the road side and when only about fifty yards beyond the house a white man opened the door and seeing me in the road called to me to stop As his order was not obeyed he set his dog upon me The dog was quickly vanquished by my stick and setting off to run at full speed I at the same moment heard the report of a gun and received its contents in my legs chiefly about and in my hams I fell on the road and was soon surrounded by several persons who it appeared were a party of patrollers who had gathered together in this house They ordered me to cross my hands which order not being immediately obeyed they beat me with sticks and stones until I was almost senseless and entirely unable to make resistance They then bound me with cords and dragged me by the feet back to the house and threw me into the kitchen like a dead dog One of my eyes was almost beaten out and the blood was running from my mouth nose and ears but in this condition they refused to wash the blood from my face or even to give me a drink of water In a short time a justice of the peace arrived and when he looked at me ordered me to be unbound and to have water to wash myself and also some bread to eat This man's heart appeared not to be altogether void of sensibility for he reprimanded in harsh terms those who had beaten me told them that their conduct was brutal and that it would have been more humane to kill me outright than to bruise and mangle me in the manner they had done He then interrogated me as to my name place of abode and place of destination and afterwards demanded the name of my master To all these inquiries I made no reply except that I was going to Maryland where I lived The justice told me it was his duty under the law to send me to jail and I was immediately put into a cart and carried to a small village called Bowling Green which I reached before ten o'clock There I was locked up in the jail and a doctor came to examine my legs and extract the shot from my wounds In the course of the operation he took out thirty-four duck shot and after dressing my legs left me to my own reflections No fever followed in the train of my disasters which I attributed to the state of my blood by long fasting and the fatigues I had undergone In the afternoon the jailer came to see me and brought my daily allowance of provisions and a jug of water The provisions consisted of more than a pound of corn-bread and some boiled bacon As my appetite was good I immediately devoured more than two-thirds of this food but reserved the rest for supper For several days I was not able to stand and in this period found great difficulty in performing the ordinary offices of life for myself no one coming to give me any aid but I did not suffer for want of food the daily allowance of the jailer being quite sufficient to appease the cravings of hunger After I grew better and was able to walk in the jail the jailer frequently called to see me and endeavoured to prevail on me to tell where I had come from but in this undertaking he was no more successful than the justice had been in the same business I remained in the jail more than a month and in this time became quite fat and strong but saw no way by which I could escape The jail was of brick the floors were of solid oak boards and the door of the same material was secured by iron bolts let into its posts and connected together by a strong band of iron reaching from the one to the other Every thing appeared sound and strong and to add to my security my feet were chained together from the time my wounds were healed This chain I acquired the knowledge of removing from my feet by working out of its socket a small iron pin that secured the bolt that held the chain round one of my legs The jailer came to see me with great regularity every morning and evening but remained only a few minutes when he came leaving me entirely alone at all other times XXIV When I had been in prison thirty-nine days and had quite recovered from the wounds that I had received the jailer was late in coming to me with my breakfast and going to the door I began to beat against it with my fist for the purpose of making a noise After beating some time against the door I happened by mere accident to strike my fist against one of the posts which to my surprise I discovered by its sound to be a mere hollow shell encrusted with a thin coat of sound timber and as I struck it the rotten wood crumbled to pieces within On a more careful examination of this post I became satisfied that I could easily split it to pieces by the aid of the iron bolt that confined my feet The jailer came with my breakfast and reprimanded me for making a noise This day appeared as long to me as a week had done heretofore but night came at length and as soon as the room in which I was confined had become quite dark I disentangled myself from the irons with which I was bound and with the aid of the long bolt easily wrenched from its place the large staple that held one end of the bar that lay across the door The hasps that held the lock in its place were drawn away almost without force and the door swung open of its own weight I now walked out into the jail-yard and found that all was quiet and that only a few lights were burning in the village windows At first I walked slowly along the road but soon quickened my pace and ran along the high-way until I was more than a mile from the jail then taking to the woods I travelled all night in a northern direction At the approach of day I concealed myself in a cedar thicket where I lay until the next evening without any thing to eat On the second night after my escape I crossed the Potomac at Hoe's ferry in a small boat that I found tied at the side of the ferry flat and on the night following crossed the Patuxent in a canoe which I found chained at the shore About one o'clock in the morning I came to the door of my wife's cabin and stood there I believe more than five minutes before I could summon sufficient fortitude to knock I at length rapped lightly on the door and was immediately asked in the well-known voice of my wife Who is there--I replied Charles She then came to the door and opening it slowly Who is this that speaks so much like my husband I then rushed into the cabin and made myself known to her but it was some time before I could convince her that I was really her husband returned from Georgia The children were then called up but they had forgotten me When I attempted to take them in my arms they fled from me and took refuge under the bed of their mother My eldest boy who was four years old when I was carried away still retained some recollections of once having had a father but could not believe that I was that father My wife who at first was overcome by astonishment at seeing me again in her cabin and was incapable of giving credit to the fidelity of her own vision after I had been in the house a few minutes seemed to awake from a dream and gathering all three of her children in her arms thrust them into my lap as I sat in the corner clapped her hands laughed and cried by turns and in her ecstasy forgot to give me any supper until I at length told her that I was hungry Before I entered the house I felt as if I could eat any thing in the shape of food but now that I attempted to eat my appetite had fled and I sat up all night with my wife and children When on my journey I thought of nothing but getting home and never reflected that when at home I might still be in danger but now that my toils were ended I began to consider with myself how I could appear in safety in Calvert county where everybody must know that I was a runaway slave With my heart thrilling with joy when I looked upon my wife and children who had not hoped ever to behold me again yet fearful of the coming of daylight which must expose me to be arrested as a fugitive slave I passed the night between the happiness of the present and the dread of the future In all the toils dangers and suffering of my long journey my courage had never forsaken me The hope of again seeing my wife and little ones had borne me triumphantly through perils that even now I reflect upon as upon some extravagant dream but when I found myself at rest under the roof of my wife the object of my labour attained and no motive to arouse my energies or give them the least impulse that firmness of resolution which had so long sustained me suddenly vanished from my bosom and I passed the night with my children around me oppressed by a melancholy foreboding of my future destiny The idea that I was utterly unable to afford protection and safeguard to my own family and was myself even more helpless than they tormented my bosom with alternate throbs of affection and fear until the dawn broke in the cast and summoned me to decide upon my future conduct When morning came I went to the great house and showed myself to my wife's master and mistress who treated me with great kindness and gave me a good breakfast Mr Symmes at first advised me to conceal myself but soon afterwards told me to go to work in the neighbourhood for wages I continued to hire myself about among the farmers until after the war broke out and until Commodore Barney came into the Patuxent with his flotilla when I enlisted on board one of his barges and was employed sometimes in the capacity of a seaman and sometimes as cook of the barge I had been on board only a few days when the British fleet entered the Patuxent and forced our flotilla high up the river I was present when the flotilla was blown up and assisted in the performance of that operation upon the barge that I was in The guns and the principal part of the armament of the flotilla were sunk in the river and lost I marched with the troops of Barney from Benedict to Bladensburg and travelled nearly the whole of the distance through heavy forests of timber or numerous and dense cedar thickets It is my opinion that if General Winder had marched the half of the troops that he had at Bladensburg down to the lower part of Prince George county and attacked the British in these woods and cedar thickets not a man of them would ever have reached Bladensburg I feel confident that in the country through which I marched one hundred Americans would have destroyed a thousand of the enemy by felling trees across the road and attacking them in ambush When we reached Bladensburg and the flotilla men were drawn up in line to work at their cannon armed with their cutlasses I volunteered to assist in working the cannon that occupied the first place on the left of the Commodore We had a full and perfect view of the British army as it advanced along the road leading to the bridge over the East Branch and I could not but admire the handsome manner in which the British officers led on their fatigued and worn-out soldiers I thought then and think yet that General Ross was one of the finest looking men that I ever saw on horseback I stood at my gun until the Commodore was shot down when he ordered us to retreat as I was told by the officer who commanded our gun If the militia regiments that lay upon our right and left could have been brought to charge the British in close fight as they crossed the bridge we should have killed or taken the whole of them in a short time but the militia ran like sheep chased by dogs My readers will not perhaps condemn me if I here make a short digression from my main narrative to give some account of the part that I took in the war on the shores of the Chesapeake and the Patuxent I did not enlist with Commodore Barney until the month of December but as I resided in Calvert county in the summer of I had an opportunity of witnessing many of the evils that followed in the train of war before I assumed the profession of arms myself In the spring of the year the British fleet came into the bay and from this time the origin of the troubles and distresses of the people of the Western Shore may be dated I had been employed at a fishery near the mouth of the Patuxent from early March until the latter part of May when a British vessel of war came off the mouth of the river and sent her boats up to drive us away from our fishing ground There was but little property at the fishery that could be destroyed but the enemy cut the seines to pieces and burned the sheds belonging to the place They then marched up two miles into the country burned the house of a planter and brought away with them several cattle that were found in his fields They also carried off more than twenty slaves which were never again restored to their owner although on the following day he went on board the ship with a flag of truce and offered a large ransom for these slaves These were the first black people whom I had known to desert to the British although the practice was afterwards so common In the course of this summer and the summer of several thousand black people deserted from their masters and mistresses and escaped to the British fleet None of these people were ever regained by their owners as the British naval officers treated them as free people and placed them on the footing of military deserters In the fall of this year a lady by the name of Wilson who owned more than a hundred slaves lost them all in one night except one man who had a wife and several children on an adjoining estate and as he could not take his family with him on account of the rigid guard that was kept over them he refused to go himself The slaves of Mrs Wilson effected their escape in the following manner Two or three of the men having agreed amongst themselves that they would run away and go to the fleet they stole a canoe one night and went off to the ship that lay nearest the shore When on board they informed the officer of the ship that their mistress owned more than a hundred other slaves whom they had left behind them They were then advised to return home and remain there until the next night and then bring with them to the beach all the slaves on the plantation--the officer promising that he would send a detachment of boats to the shore to bring them off This advice was followed and the fugitives returned before day to their cabins on the plantation of their mistress On the next night having communicated their plans to some of their fellow-slaves they rose about midnight and partly by persuasion partly by compulsion carried off all the slaves on the plantation with the exception of the man already named When they reached the beach they kindled a fire as had been concerted with the British officers and the boats of the fleet came off and removed this whole party on board In the morning when the overseer of Mrs Wilson arose and went to call his hands to the field he found only empty cabins in the quarter with a single man remaining to tell what had become of his fellows This was the greatest disaster that had befallen any individual in our neighbourhood in the course of the war and as the sufferer was a lady much sympathy was excited in her favour A large number of gentlemen met together for the purpose of endeavouring to devise some means of recovering the fugitive slaves Their consultations ended in sending a deputation of gentlemen on board the fleet with a flag of truce to solicit the restoration of the deserters either as a matter of favour or for such ransom as might be agreed upon Strong hopes were entertained that the runaways might be induced voluntarily to return to the service of their mistress as she had never treated them with great severity To accomplish if possible this latter end I was spoken to to go along with the flag of truce in the assumed character of the servant of one of the gentlemen who bore it but in the real character of the advocate of the mistress for the purpose of inducing her slaves to return to her service We went on board the ship in the afternoon and I observed that the gentlemen who went with me were received by the British officers with very little ceremony The captain did not show himself on deck nor were the gentlemen invited into his cabin They were shown into a large square room under the first deck of the ship which was a and here a great number of officers came to talk to them and ask them questions concerning the war and the state of the country The whole of the runaways were on board this ship lounging about on the main deck or leaning against the sides of the ship's bulwarks I went amongst them and talked to them a long time on the subject of returning home but found that their heads were full of notions of liberty and happiness in some of the West India islands In the afternoon all the gentlemen except one returned home in the boat that they had come off in The gentleman who remained on board was a young man of pleasing manners and lively conversation who appeared even before the other gentlemen who had come with the flag had left the ship to have become quite a favourite with the younger British officers Permission was obtained of the British captain for this young gentleman to remain on board a few days for the purpose as he alleged of seeing the curiosities of the ship He had permission to retain me with him as his servant and I was instructed to exert myself to the utmost to prevail on the runaway slaves to return to their mistress The ship lay at anchor off the shore of Calvert county until the second night after I came on board when from some cause which I was not able to understand this ship and all the rest of the fleet got under weigh and stood down the Bay to the neighbourhood of Tangier Islands where she again cast anchor soon after sunrise the next morning in ten fathoms water I was now at least seventy or eighty miles from home in a ship of the public enemies of the country and liable to be carried off to sea and to be conveyed to the most distant part of the world To increase my alarm about noon of this day a sloop of war cast anchor under the stern of our ship and all the black people that were with us were immediately removed on board the sloop I was invited and even urged to go with the others who I was told were bound to the island of Trinidad in the West Indies where they would have lands given to them and where they were to be free I returned many thanks for their kind offers but respectfully declined them telling those who made them that I was already a freeman and though I owned no land myself yet I could have plenty of land of other people to cultivate In the evening the sloop weighed anchor and stood down the Bay with more than two hundred and fifty black people on board I watched her as she sailed away from us until the darkness of the night shut her out from my sight In the morning she was not to be seen What became of the miserable mass of black fugitives that this vessel took to sea I never learned My mission was now at an end and I spoke this day to the young gentleman under whose care I was to endeavour to procure some means of conveying both him and me back again to Calvert My protector seemed no less embarrassed than I was and informed me that the officers of the ship they would not land us on the Western Shore within less than two weeks I was obliged to content myself the best way I could in my confinement on shipboard and I amused myself by talking to the sailors and giving them an account of the way in which I had passed my life on the tobacco and cotton plantations in return for which the seamen gave many long stories of their adventures at sea and of the battles they had been engaged in I lived well whilst on board this ship as they allowed me to share in a mess In compensation for their civility I gave them many useful instructions in the art of taking fish in the Bay This great ship lay at anchor like a vast castle moored by the cable but there were many small vessels used as tenders to the fleet that were continually sailing up and down the Bay by night as well as by day in pursuit of any thing that they might fall in with that they could take from the Americans Whilst I was on board I saw more than thirty vessels chiefly Bay craft brought to our anchorage and there burned after being stripped of every thing valuable that could be taken from them The people who manned and navigated these vessels were made prisoners and dispersed amongst the several ships of the fleet until they could be removed to Halifax or the West Indies One day a small schooner was seen standing out of the mouth of Nanticoke river and beating up the Bay Chase was immediately given by several of the light vessels belonging to the fleet and continued until nightfall when I could no longer see the sails but the next day the British vessels returned bringing in their company the little schooner which was manned by her owner who acted as captain and two boys On board the schooner besides her crew were several passengers seven in number I believe The people were taken out of this little vessel which was laden with Indian corn and after her cargo had been removed she was burned in view of her owner who seemed much affected at the sight and that it was all the property he owned in the world and that his wife and children were now beggars The passengers and crew of this little vessel were all retained as prisoners of war on board the in which I was and were shut up every night in a room on the lower gun deck In this room there were several port-holes which were suffered to remain open for the benefit of the air After these people had been on board three or four days a boat's crew that had been out somewhere in the evening when they returned to the ship tied the boat with a long rope to one of the halyards of the ship and left the boat floating near the ship's bows Some time after night the tide turned moved the boat along the side of the ship and floated it directly under the port-holes of the prisoners' room The night was dark and warm and I had taken a station on the upper deck and was leaning over the bulwarks when my attention was drawn towards the water by hearing something drop into the boat that lay along side Dark as it was I could see the forms of men passing out of the port-holes into the boat In less than two minutes nine persons had entered the boat and I then heard a low whisper which I could not understand but immediately afterwards saw the boat drifting with the tide which convinced me that she was loose and that the prisoners were in her I nothing and in a short time the boat was out of sight She had however not been long gone when the watch on deck passed near me and looking over the side of the ship called to the officer on deck that the yawl was gone The officer on deck instantly called to some one below to examine the room of the prisoners and received for answer that the prisoners had fled A gun was immediately fired under me on one of the lower decks the ship's bells were tolled numerous blue lights were made ready and cast high into the air which performing a curve in the atmosphere illuminated the face of the water all the way from the ship to the place where they fell The other ships in the fleet all answered by firing guns casting out lights and ringing their large bells Three boats put off from our ship in search of the fugitives with as little delay as possible and after being absent more than an hour returned without finding those who had escaped This affair presented one of the finest night scenes that can well be imagined The deep thunder of the heavy artillery as it broke upon the stillness of the night and re-echoed from the distant shores the solemn and mournful tones of the numerous bells as they answered each other from ship to ship as the sounds rose in the air and died away in the distance on the wide expanse of waters with the shouts of the seamen and the pale and ghastly appearance of the blue lights as they rose into the atmosphere and then descended and died away in the water--all combined together to affect both the eye and the ear in a manner the most impressive One of the prisoners remained in the ship not having courage to undertake with his companions the daring and dangerous exploit of escaping from the ship in her own boat When the morning came this man explained to the officers of the ship the whole plan that had been devised and pursued by his companions When they found that the boat had floated under the port-holes of their room some one of the number proposed to the rest to attempt to escape as the oars of the boat had been left in her but a difficulty suggested itself at the outset which was this the oars could not be worked on the boat without making a great noise sufficient to alarm the watch on deck To avoid this one of the prisoners he would undertake to pull off his coat and muffle one of the oars with it and scull the boat until they should be clear of the fleet when they could lay both oars on the boat and row to shore We lay much nearer to the Western Shore than we were to the Eastern but this man the design of the prisoners was to pull to the Eastern Shore All the boats that went from our ship pulled for the Western Shore and by this means the prisoners escaped without being seen The captain of the ship was much enraged at the escape of these prisoners and swore he would be avenged of the Yankees in a short time In this he was as good as his word for the very next day he fitted out an expedition consisting of eleven long boats and more than two hundred men who landed on the Western Shore and burned three house with all their furniture and killed a great number of cattle The officer who headed this expedition brought back with him a large silk handkerchief full of silver spoons and other articles of silver plate I saw him exhibit these trophies of his valour amongst his brother officers on the deck of the ship After I had been on board nearly a week a furious northeast storm came on and blew for three days accompanied with frequent gusts of rain In the evening of the second day we saw two schooners standing down the bay and sailing close on the wind so as to pass between the fleet and the Eastern Shore As it was dangerous for large ships to approach much nearer the Eastern Shore than where we lay several of the tenders of the fleet amounting in all to more than a dozen were ordered by signal to to intercept the strange sails and bring them to the fleet The tenders got under weigh and stood before the wind for the purpose of encountering the schooners as they came down the Bay These schooners proved to be two heavy armed American privateers and when the tenders approached them a furious battle commenced with cannon which lasted more than an hour and until the privateers had passed quite below the anchorage of the fleet Several of the tenders were much damaged in their hulls and rigging and it was that they lost more than twenty men I could not perceive that the privateers sustained the least injury as they never shortened sail nor altered their course until they had passed to the windward of all the ships of the fleet when they changed their bearing and stood for the Capes of Virginia There were nearly forty vessels in the fleet great and small and yet these two privateers braved the whole of them in open daylight and went to sea in spite of them On the ninth day after we came on board the fleet again moved up the Bay and when we were off the mouth of the Potomac the captain sent the young gentleman in whose service I was together with myself on shore in his own gig The lieutenant who had command of the gig after he set us on shore went up to the house of a farmer whose estate lay upon to the Bay and after pilfering the premises of every thing that he could carry away set fire to the house and returned to his boat In the course of the summer and fall of the year I witnessed many other atrocities of equal enormity I continued with the army after the sack of Washington and assisted in the defence of Baltimore but in the fall of I procured my discharge from the army and went to work in Baltimore as a free black man From this time until the year I worked in various places in Maryland as a free man sometimes in Baltimore sometimes in Annapolis and frequently in Washington My wife died in the year and from that time I was not often in Calvert county I was fortunate in the enjoyment of good health and by constant economy I found myself in possession in the year of three hundred and fifty dollars in money the proceeds of my labour I now removed to the neighbourhood of Baltimore and purchased a lot of twelve acres of ground upon which I erected a small house and became a farmer on my own account and upon my own property I purchased a yoke of oxen and two cows and became a regular attendant of the Baltimore market where I sold the products of my own farm and dairy In the course of two or three years I had brought my little farm into very good culture and had increased my stock of cattle to four cows and several younger animals I now lived very happily and had an abundance of all the necessaries of life around me I had married a second wife who bore me four children and I now looked forward to an old age of comfort if not of ease but I was soon to be awakened from this dream XXV In the month of June as I was ploughing in my lot three gentlemen rode up to my fence and alighting from their horses all came over the fence and approached me when one of them told me he was the sheriff and had a writ in his pocket which commanded him to take me to Baltimore I was not conscious of having done any thing injurious to any one but yet felt a distrust of these men who were all strangers to me I told them I would go with them if they would permit me to turn my oxen loose from the plough but it was my intention to seek an opportunity of escaping to the house of a gentleman who lived about a mile from me This purpose I was not able to effect for whilst I was taking the yoke from the oxen one of the gentlemen came behind me and knocked me down with a heavy whip that he carried in his hand When I recovered from the stunning effects of this blow I found myself bound with my hands behind me and strong cords closely wrapped about my arms In this condition I was forced to set out immediately for Baltimore without speaking to my wife or even entering my door I expected that on arriving at Baltimore I should be taken before a judge for the purpose of being tried but in this I was deceived They led me to the city jail and there shut me up with several other black people both men and women who told me that they had lately been purchased by a trader from Georgia I now saw the extent of my misfortune but could not learn who the persons were who had seized me In the evening however one of the gentlemen who had brought me from home came into the jail with the jailer and asked me if I knew him On being answered in the negative he told me that he knew me very well and asked me if I did not recollect the time when he and his brother had whipped me before my master's door in Georgia I now recognised the features of the younger of the two brothers of my mistress but this man was so changed in his appearance from the time when I had last seen him that if he had not declared himself I should never have known him When I left Georgia he was not more than twenty-one or two years of age and had black bushy hair His hair was now thin and gray and all his features were changed After lying in jail a little more than two weeks strongly ironed my fellow prisoners and I were one day chained together handcuffed in pairs and in this way driven about ten miles out of Baltimore where we remained all night On the evening of the second day we halted at Bladensburg and were shut up in a small house within full view of the very ground where sixteen years before I had fought in the ranks of the army of the United States in defence of the liberty and independence of that which I then regarded as my country It seemed as if it had been but yesterday that I had seen the British columns advancing across the bridge now before me directing their fire against me and my companions in arms The thought now struck me that if I had deserted that day and gone over to the enemies of the United States how different would my situation at this moment have been And this thought I is the reward of the part I bore in the dangers and fatigues of that disastrous battle On the next morning we marched through Washington and as we passed in front of the President's house I saw an old gentleman walking in the grounds near the gate This man I was told was the President of the United States Within four weeks after we left Washington I was in Milledgeville in Georgia near which the man who had kidnapped me resided He took me home with him and set me to work on his plantation but I had now enjoyed liberty too long to submit quietly to the endurance of slavery I had no sooner come here than I began to devise ways of escaping again from the hands of my tyrants and of making my way to the northern states The month of August was now approaching which is a favourable season of the year to travel on account of the abundance of food that is to be found in the corn fields and orchards but I remembered the dreadful sufferings that I had endured in my former journey from the south and determined if possible to devise some scheme of getting away that would not subject me to such hardships After several weeks of consideration I resolved to run away go to some of the seaports and endeavour to get a passage on board a vessel bound to a northern city With this view I assumed the appearance of resignation and composure under the new aspect of my fortune and even went so far as to tell my new master that I lived more comfortably with him in his cotton fields than I had formerly done on my own small farm in Maryland though I believe my master did me the justice to give no credit to my assertions on this subject From the moment I discovered in Maryland that I had fallen into the hands of the brother of my former mistress I gave up all hope of contesting his right to arrest me with success at law as I supposed he had come with authority to reclaim me as the property of his sister but after I had returned to Georgia and had been at work some weeks on the plantation of my new master I learned that he now claimed me as his own slave and that he had reported he had purchased me in Baltimore It was now clear to me that this man having by some means learned the place of my residence in Maryland had kidnapped and now held me as his slave without the colour of legal right but complaint on my part was useless and resistance vain I was again reduced to the condition of a common field slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia and compelled to subsist on the very scanty and coarse food allowed to the southern slaves I had been absent from Georgia almost twenty years and in that period great changes had doubtlessly taken place in the face of the country as well as in the condition of human society I had never been in Milledgeville until I was brought there by the man who had kidnapped me in Maryland and I was now a slave among entire strangers and had no friend to give me the consolation of kind words such as I had formerly received from my master in Morgan county The plantation on which I was now a slave had formerly belonged to the father of my mistress and some of my fellow-slaves had been well acquainted with her in her youth From these people I learned that after the death of my master and my flight from Georgia my mistress had become the wife of a second husband who had removed with her to the state of Louisiana more than fifteen years ago After ascertaining these facts which proved beyond all doubt that my present master had no right whatsoever to me in either law or justice I determined that before encountering the dangers and sufferings that must necessarily attend my second flight from Georgia I would attempt to claim the protection of the laws of the country and try to get myself discharged from the unjust slavery in which I was now held For this purpose I went to Milledgeville one Sunday and inquired for a lawyer of a black man whom I met in the street This person told me that his master was a lawyer and went with me to his house The lawyer after talking to me some time told me that my master was his client and that he therefore could not undertake my cause but referred me to a young gentleman who he would do my business for me Accordingly to this young man I went and after relating my whole story to him he told me that he believed he could not do any thing for me as I had no witnesses to prove my freedom I rejoined that it seemed hard that I must be compelled to prove myself a freeman and that it would appear more consonant to reason that my master should prove me to be a slave He however assured me that this was not the law of Georgia where every man of colour was presumed to be a slave until he could prove that he was free He then told me that if I expected him to talk to me I must give him a fee whereupon I gave him all the money I had been able to procure since my arrival in the country which was two dollars and seventy-five cents When I offered him this money the lawyer tossed his head and such a trifle was not worth accepting but nevertheless he took it and then asked me if I could get some more money before the next Sunday That if I could get another dollar he would issue a writ and have me brought before the court but if he succeeded in getting me set free I must engage to serve him a year To these conditions I agreed and signed a paper which the lawyer wrote and which was signed by two persons as witnesses The brother of my pretended master was yet living in this neighbourhood and the lawyer advised me to have him brought forward as a witness to prove that I was not the slave of my present pretended owner On the Wednesday following my visit to Milledgeville the sheriff came to my master's plantation and took me from the field to the house telling me as I walked beside him that he had a writ which commanded him to take me to Milledgeville Instead however of obeying the command of his writ when we arrived at the house he took a bond of my master that he would produce me at the court-house on the next day Friday and then rode away leaving me at the mercy of my kidnapper Since I had been on this plantation I had never been whipped although all the other slaves of whom there were more than fifty were frequently flogged without any apparent cause I had all along attributed my exemption from the lash to the fears of my master He knew I had formerly run away from his sister on account of her cruelty and his own savage conduct to me and I believed that he was still apprehensive that a repetition of his former barbarity might produce the same effect that it had done twenty years before His evil passions were like fire covered with ashes concealed not extinguished He now found that I was determined to try to regain my liberty at all events and the sheriff was no sooner gone than the overseer was sent for to come from the field and I was tied up and whipped with the long lashed negro whip until I fainted and was carried in a state of insensibility to my lodgings in the quarter It was night when I recovered my understanding sufficiently to be aware of my true situation I now found that my wounds had been oiled and that I was wrapped in a piece of clean linen cloth but for several days I was unable to leave my bed When Friday came I was not taken to Milledgeville and afterwards learned that my master reported to the court that I had been taken ill and was not able to leave the house The judge asked no questions as to the cause of my illness At the end of two weeks I was taken to Milledgeville and carried before a judge who first asked a few questions of my master as to the length of time that he had owned me and the place where he had purchased me He stated in my presence that he had purchased me with several others at public auction in the city of Baltimore and had paid five hundred and ten dollars for me I was not permitted to speak to the court much less to contradict this falsehood in the manner it deserved The brother of my master was then called as a witness by my lawyer but the witness refused to be sworn or examined on account of his interest in me as his slave In support of his refusal he produced a bill of sale from my master to himself for an equal undivided half part of the slave Charles This bill of sale was dated several weeks previous to the time of trial and gave rise to an argument between the opposing lawyers that continued until the court adjourned in the evening On the next morning I was again brought into court and the judge now delivered his opinion which was that the witness could not be compelled to give evidence in a cause to which he was really though not nominally a party The court then proceeded to give judgment in the cause now before it and declared that the law was well settled in Georgia that every negro was presumed to be a slave until he proved his freedom by the clearest evidence That where a negro was found in the custody or keeping of a white man the law declared that white man to be his master without any evidence on the subject But the case before the court was exceedingly plain and free from all doubt or difficulty Here the master has brought this slave into the state of Georgia as his property has held him as a slave ever since and still holds him as a slave The title of the master in this case is the best title that a man can have to any property and the order of the court is that the slave Charles be returned to the custody of his master I was immediately ordered to return home and from this time until I left the plantation my life was a continual torment to me The overseer often came up to me in the field and gave me several lashes with his long whip over my naked back through mere wantonness and I was often compelled after I had done my day's work in the field to cut wood or perform some other labour at the house until long after dark My sufferings were too great to be borne long by any human creature and to a man who had once tasted the sweets of liberty they were doubly tormenting There was nothing in the form of danger that could intimidate me if the road on which I had to encounter it led me to freedom That season of the year most favourable to my escape from bondage had at length arrived The corn in the fields was so far grown as to be fit for roasting the peaches were beginning to ripen and the sweet potatoes were large enough to be eaten but notwithstanding all this the difficulties that surrounded me were greater than can easily be imagined by any one who has never been a slave in the lower country of Georgia In the first place I was almost naked having no other clothes than a ragged shirt of tow cloth and a pair of old trousers of the same material with an old woollen jacket that I had brought with me from home In addition to this I was closely watched every evening until I had finished the labour assigned me and then I was locked up in a small cabin by myself for the night This cabin was really a prison and had been built for the purpose of confining such of the slaves of this estate as were tried in the evening and sentenced to be whipped in the morning It was built of strong oak logs hewn square and dovetailed together at the corners It had no window in it but as the logs did not fit very close together there was never any want of air in this jail in which I had been locked up every night since my trial before the court On Sundays I was permitted to go to work in the fields with the other people who worked on that day if I chose so to do but at this time I was put under the charge of an old African negro who was instructed to give immediate information if I attempted to leave the field To escape on Sunday was impossible and there seemed to be no hope of getting out of my sleeping room the floor of which was made of strong pine plank Fortune at length did for me that which I had not been able to accomplish by the greatest efforts for myself The lock that was on the door of my nightly prison was a large stock lock and had been clumsily fitted on the door so that the end of the lock pressed against the door-case and made it difficult to shut the door even in dry weather When the weather was damp and the wood was swollen with moisture it was not easy to close the door at all Late in the month of September the weather became cloudy and much rain fell The clouds continued to obscure the heavens for four or five days One evening when I was ordered to my house as it was called the overseer followed me without a light although it was very dark When I was in the house he pushed the door after me with all his strength The violence of the effort caused the door to pass within the case at the top for one or two feet and this held it so fast that he could not again pull it open Supposing in the extreme darkness that the door was shut he turned the key and the bolt of the lock passing on the outside of the staple intended to receive it completely deceived him He then withdrew the key and went away Soon after he was gone I went to the door and feeling with my hands ascertained that it was not shut An opportunity now presented itself for me to escape from my prisonhouse with a prospect of being able to be so far from my master's residence before morning that none could soon overtake me even should the course of my flight be ascertained Waiting quietly until every one about the quarter had ceased to be heard I applied one of my feet to the door and giving it a strong push forced it open The world was now all before me but the darkness was so profound as to obscure from my vision the largest objects even a house at the distance of a few yards But dark as it was necessity compelled me to leave the plantation without delay and knowing only the great road that led to Milledgeville amongst the various roads of this country I set off at a brisk walk on this public highway assured that no one could apprehend me in so dark a night It was only about seven miles to Milledgeville and when I reached that town several lights were burning in the windows of the houses but keeping on directly through the village I neither saw nor heard any person in it and after gaining the open country my first care was to find some secure place where shelter could be found for the next day but no appearance of thick woods was to be seen for several miles and two or three hours must have elapsed before a forest of sufficient magnitude was found to answer my purposes It was perhaps three o'clock in the morning when I took refuge in a thick and dismal swamp that lay on the right hand of the road intending to remain here until daylight and then look out for a secret place to conceal myself in during the day Hitherto although the night was so extremely dark it had not rained any but soon after my halt in the swamp the rain began to fall in floods rather than in showers which made me as wet as if I had swum a river Daylight at length appeared but brought with it very little mitigation of my suffering for the swamp in which my hiding-place was lay in the midst of a well-peopled country and was surrounded on all sides by cotton and corn fields so close to me that the open spaces of the cleared land could be seen from my position It was dangerous to move lest some one should see me and painful to remain without food when hunger was consuming me My resting place in the swamp was within view of the road and soon after sunrise although it continued to rain fast numerous horsemen were seen passing along the road by the way that had led me to the swamp There was little doubt on my mind that these people were in search of me and the sequel proved that my surmises were well founded It rained throughout this day and the fear of being apprehended by those who came in pursuit of me confined me to the swamp until after dark the following evening when I ventured to leave the thicket and return to the high road the bearing of which it was impossible for me to ascertain on account of the dense clouds that obscured the heavens All that could be done in my situation was to take care not to follow that end of the road which had led me to the swamp Turning my back once more upon Milledgeville and walking at a quick pace every effort was made to remove myself as far as possible this night from the scene of suffering for which that swamp will be always memorable in my mind The rain had ceased to fall at the going down of the sun and the darkness of this second night was not so great as that of the first had been This circumstance was regarded by me as a happy presage of the final success that awaited my undertaking Events proved that I was no prophet for the dim light of this night was the cause of the dreadful misfortune that awaited me In a former part of this volume the reader is made acquainted with the deep interest that is taken by all the planters far and wide around the plantation from which a slave has escaped by running away Twenty years had wrought no change in favour of the fugitive nor had the feuds and dissensions that agitate and distract the communities of white men produced any relaxation in the friendship that they profess to feel and really do feel for each other on a question of so much importance to them all More than twenty miles of road had been left behind me this night and it must have been two or three o'clock in the morning when as I was passing a part of the road that led through a dense pine grove where the trees on either side grew close to the wheel tracks five or six men suddenly rushed upon me from both sides of the road and with loud cries of Kill him kill him accompanied with oaths and opprobrious language seized me dragged me to the ground and bound me fast with a long cord which was wrapped round my arms and body so as to confine my hands below my hips In this condition I was driven or rather dragged about two miles to a kind of tavern or public house that stood by the side of the road where my captors were joined soon after daylight by at least twenty of their companions who had been out all night waiting and watching for me on the other roads of this part of the country Those who had taken me were loudly applauded by their fellows and the whole party passed the morning in drinking singing songs and playing cards at this house At breakfast time they gave me a large cake of corn bread and some sour milk for breakfast About ten o'clock in the morning my master arrived at the tavern in company with two or three other gentlemen all strangers to me My master when he came into my presence looked at me and Well Charles you had bad luck in running away this time and immediately asked aloud what any person would give for me One man who was slightly intoxicated he would give four hundred dollars for me Other bids followed until my price was soon up to five hundred and eighty dollars for which I was stricken off by my master himself to a gentleman who immediately gave his note for me and took charge of me as his property XXVI The name of my new master was Jones a planter who was only a visiter in this part of the country his residence being about fifty miles down the country The next day my new master set off with me to the place of his residence permitting me to walk behind him as he rode on horseback and leaving me entirely unshackled I was resolved that as my owner treated me with so much liberality the trust he reposed in me should not be broken until after we had reached his home though the determination of again running away and attempting to escape from Georgia never abandoned me for a moment The country through which we passed on our journey was not rich The soil was sandy light and in many places much exhausted by excessive tillage The timber in the woods where the ground was high was almost exclusively pine but many swamps and extensive tracts of low ground intervened in which maple gum and all the other trees common to such land in the south abounded No improvement in the condition of the slaves on the plantations was here perceptible but it appeared to me that there was now even a greater want of good clothes amongst the slaves on the various plantations that we passed than had existed twenty years before Everywhere the overseers still kept up the same custom of walking in the field with the long whip that has been elsewhere described and everywhere the slaves proved by the husky appearance of their skins and the dry sunburnt aspect of their hair that they were strangers to animal food On the second day of our journey in the evening we arrived at the residence of my master about eighty miles from Savannah The plantation which had now become the place of my residence was not large containing only about three hundred acres of cleared land and having on it about thirty working slaves of all classes It was now the very midst of the season of picking cotton and at the end of twenty years from the time of my first flight I again had a daily task assigned me with the promise of half a cent a pound for all the cotton I should pick beyond my day's work Picking cotton like every other occupation requiring active manipulation depends more upon sleight than strength and I was not now able to pick so much in a day as I was once able to do My master seemed to be a man ardently bent on the acquisition of wealth and came into the field where we were at work almost every day frequently remonstrating in strong language with the overseer because he did not get more work done Our rations on this place were a half peck of corn per week in addition to which we had rather more than a peck of sweet potatoes allowed to each person Our provisions were distributed to us on every Sunday morning by the overseer but my master was generally present either to see that justice was done to us or that injustice was not done to himself When I had been here about a week my master came into the field one day and in passing near me stopped and told me that I had now fallen into good hands as it was his practice not to whip his people much That he in truth never whipped them nor suffered his overseer to whip them except in flagrant cases That he had discovered a mode of punishment much more mild and at the same time much more effectual than flogging and that he governed his negroes exclusively under this mode of discipline He then told me that when I came home in the evening I must come to the house and that he would then make me acquainted with the principles upon which he chastised his slaves Going to the house in the evening according to orders my master showed me a pump set in a well in which the water rose within ten feet of the surface of the ground The spout of this pump was elevated at least thirteen feet above the earth and when the water was to be drawn from it the person who worked the handle ascended by a ladder to the proper station The water in this well although so near the surface was very cold and the pump discharged it in a large stream One of the women employed in the house had committed some offence for which she was to be punished and the opportunity was embraced of exhibiting to me the effect of this novel mode of torture upon the human frame The woman was stripped quite naked and tied to a post that stood just under the stream of water as it fell from the spout of the pump A lad was then ordered to ascend the ladder and pump water upon the head and shoulders of the victim who had not been under the waterfall more than a minute before she began to cry and scream in a most lamentable manner In a short time she exerted her strength in the most convulsive throes in trying to escape from the post but as the cords were strong this was impossible After another minute or a little more her cries became weaker and soon afterwards her head fell forward upon her breast and then the boy was ordered to cease pumping the water The woman was removed in a state of insensibility but recovered her faculties in about an hour The next morning she complained of lightness of head but was able to go to work This punishment of the pump as it is called was never inflicted on me and I am only able to describe it as it has been described to me by those who have endured it When the water first strikes the head and arm it is not at all painful but in a very short time it produces the sensation that is felt when heavy blows are inflicted with large rods of the size of a man's finger This perception becomes more and more painful until the skull bone and shoulder blades appear to be broken in pieces Finally all the faculties become oppressed breathing becomes more and more difficult until the eye-sight becomes dim and animation ceases This punishment is in fact a temporary murder as all the pains are endured that can be felt by a person who is deprived of life by being beaten with bludgeons--but after the punishment of the pump the sufferer is restored to existence by being laid in a bed and covered with warm clothes A giddiness of the head and oppression of the breast follows this operation for a day or two and sometimes longer The object of calling me to be a witness of this new mode of torture doubtlessly was was to intimidate me from running away but like medicines administered by empirics the spectacle had precisely the opposite effect from that which it was expected to produce After my arrival on this estate my intention had been to defer my elopement until the next year before I had seen the torture inflicted on this unfortunate woman but from that moment my resolution was unalterably fixed to escape as quickly as possible Such was my desperation of feeling at this time that I deliberated seriously upon the project of endeavouring to make my way southward for the purpose of joining the Indians in Florida Fortune reserved a more agreeable fate for me On the Saturday night after the woman was punished at the pump I stole a yard of cotton bagging from the cotton-gin house and converted it into a bag by means of a coarse needle and thread that I borrowed of one of the black women On the next morning when our weekly rations were distributed to us my portion was carefully placed in my bag under pretence of fears that it would be stolen from me if it was left open in the loft of the kitchen that I lodged in This day being Sunday I did not go to the field to work as usual on that day but under pretence of being unwell remained in the kitchen all day to be the better prepared for the toils of the following night After daylight had totally disappeared taking my bag under my arm under pretence of going to the mill to grind my corn I stole softly across the cotton fields to the nearest woods and taking an observation of the stars directed my course to the eastward resolved that in no event should any thing induce me to travel a single yard on the high road until at least one hundred miles from this plantation Keeping on steadily through the whole of this night and meeting with no swamps or briery thickets in my way I have no doubt that before daylight the plantation was more than thirty miles behind me Twenty years before this I had been in Savannah and noted at that time that great numbers of ships were in that port taking in loading of cotton My plan now was to reach Savannah in the best way I could by some means to be devised after my arrival in the city to procure a passage to some of the northern cities When day appeared before me I was in a large cotton field and before the woods could be reached it was gray dawn but the forest bordering on the field was large and afforded me good shelter through the day under the cover of a large thicket of swamp laurel that lay at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the field It now became necessary to kindle a fire for all my stock of provisions consisting of corn and potatoes was raw and undressed Less fortunate now than in my former flight no fire apparatus was in my possession and driven at last to the extremity I determined to endeavour to produce fire by rubbing two sticks together and spent at least two hours of incessant toil in this vain operation without the least prospect of success Abandoning this project at length I turned my thoughts to searching for a stone of some kind with which to endeavour to extract fire from an old jack knife that had been my companion in Maryland for more than three years My labours were fruitless No stone could be found in this swamp and the day was passed in anxiety and hunger a few raw potatoes being my only food Night at length came and with it a renewal of my travelling labours Avoiding with the utmost care every appearance of a road and pursuing my way until daylight I must have travelled at least thirty miles this night Awhile before day in crossing a field I fortunately came upon a bed of large pebbles on the side of a hill Several of these were deposited in my bag which enabled me when day arrived to procure fire with which I parched corn and roasted potatoes sufficient to subsist me for two or three days On the fourth night of my journey fortune directed me to a broad open highway that appeared to be much travelled Near the side of this road I established my quarters for the day in a thick pine wood for the purpose of making observations upon the people who travelled it and of judging thence of the part of the country to which it led Soon after daylight a wagon passed along drawn by oxen and loaded with bales of cotton then followed by some white men on horseback and soon after sunrise a whole train of wagons and carts all loaded with bales of cotton passed by following the wagon first seen by me In the course of the day at least one hundred wagons and carts passed along this road towards the south-east all laden with cotton bales and at least an equal number came towards the west either laden with casks of various dimensions or entirely empty Numerous horsemen many carriages and great numbers of persons on foot also passed to and fro on this road in the course of the day All these indications satisfied me that I must be near some large town the seat of an extensive cotton market The next consideration with me was to know how far it was to this town for which purpose I determined to travel on the road the succeeding night Lying in the woods until about eleven o'clock I rose came to the road and travelled it until within an hour of daylight at which time the country around me appeared almost wholly clear of timber and houses became much more numerous than they had been in the former part of my journey Things continued to wear this aspect until daylight when I stopped and sat down by the side of a high fence that stood beside the road After remaining here a short time a wagon laden with cotton passed along drawn by oxen whose driver a black man asked me if I was going towards town Being answered in the affirmative he then asked me if I did not wish to ride in his wagon I told him I had been out of town all night and should be very thankful to him for a ride at the same time ascending his wagon and placing myself in a secure and easy position on the bags of cotton In this manner we travelled on for about two hours when we entered the town of Savannah In my situation there was no danger of any one suspecting me to be a runaway slave for no runaway had ever been known to flee from the country and seek refuge in Savannah The man who drove the wagon passed through several of the principal streets of the city and stopped his team before a large warehouse standing on a wharf looking into the river Here I assisted my new friend to unload his cotton and when we were done he invited me to share his breakfast with him consisting of corn bread roasted potatoes and some cold boiled rice Whilst we were at our breakfast a black man came along the street and asked us if we knew where he could hire a hand to help him to work a day or two I at once replied that my master had sent me to town to hire myself out for a few weeks and that I was ready to go with him immediately The joy I felt at finding employment so overcame me that all thought of my wages was forgotten Bidding farewell to the man who had given me my breakfast and thanking him in my heart for his kindness I followed my new employer who informed me that he had engaged to remove a thousand bales of cotton from a large warehouse to the end of a wharf at which a ship lay that was taking in the cotton as a load This man was a slave but hired his time of his master at two hundred and fifty dollars a year which he he paid in monthly instalments He did what he called job work which consisted of undertaking jobs and hiring men to work under him if the job was too great to be performed by himself In the present instance he had seven or eight black men beside me all hired to help him to remove the cotton in wheel-barrows and lay it near the end of the wharf when it was taken up by sailors and carried on board the ship that was receiving it We continued working hard all day and amongst the crew of the ship was a black man with whom I resolved to become acquainted by some means Accordingly at night after we had quit our work I went to the end of the wharf against which the ship lay moored and stood there a long time waiting for the black sailor to make his appearance on deck At length my desires were gratified He came upon the deck and sat down near the main-mast with a pipe in his mouth which he was smoking with great apparent pleasure After a few minutes I spoke to him for he had not yet seen me as it appeared and when he heard my voice he rose up and came to the side of the ship near where I stood We entered into conversation together in the course of which he informed me that his home was in New-York that he had a wife and several children there but that he followed the sea for a livelihood and knew no other mode of life He also asked me where my master lived and if Georgia had always been the place of my residence I deemed this a favourable opportunity of effecting the object I had in view in seeking the acquaintance of this man and told him at once that by law and justice I was a free man but had been kidnapped near Baltimore forcibly brought to Georgia and sold there as a slave That I was now a fugitive from my master and in search of some means of getting back to my wife and children The man seemed moved by the account of my sufferings and at the close of my narrative told me he could not receive me on board the ship as the captain had given positive orders to him not to let any of the negroes of Savannah come on board lest they should steal something belonging to the ship He further told me that he was on watch and should continue on deck two hours That he was forced to take a turn of watching the ship every night for two hours but that his turn would not come the next night until after midnight I now begged him to enable me to secrete myself on board the ship previous to the time of her sailing so that I might be conveyed to Philadelphia whither the ship was bound with her load of cotton He at first received my application with great coldness and he would not do any thing contrary to the orders of the captain but before we parted he he should be glad to assist me if he could but that the execution of the plan proposed by me would be attended with great dangers if not ruin In my situation there was nothing too hazardous for me to undertake and I informed him that if he would let me hide myself in the hold of the ship amongst the bags of cotton no one should ever know that he had any knowledge of the fact and that all the danger and all the disasters that might attend the affair should fall exclusively on me He finally told me to go away and that he would think of the matter until the next day It was obvious that his heart was softened in my favour that his feelings of compassion almost impelled him to do an act in my behalf that was forbidden by his judgment and his sense of duty to his employers As the houses of the city were now closed and I was a stranger in the place I went to a wagon that stood in front of the warehouse and had been unladen of the cotton that had been brought in it and creeping into it made my bed with the driver who permitted me to share his lodgings amongst some corn tops that he had brought to feed his oxen When the morning came I went again to the ship and when the people came on deck asked them for the captain whom I should not have known by his dress which was very nearly similar to that of the sailors On being asked if he did not wish to hire a hand to help to load his ship he told me I might go to work amongst the men if I chose and he would pay me what I was worth My object was to procure employment on board the ship and not to get wages and in the course of this day I found means to enter the hold of the ship several times and examine it minutely The black sailor promised that he would not betray me and that if I could find the means of escaping on board the ship he would not disclose it At the end of three days the ship had taken in her loading and the captain in my presence that he intended to sail the day after No time was now to be lost and asking the captain what he thought I had earned he gave me three dollars which was certainly very liberal pay considering that during the whole time that I had worked for him my fare had been the same as that of the sailors who had as much as they could consume of excellent food The sailors were now busy in trimming the ship and making ready for sea and observing that this work required them to spend much time in the hold of the ship I went to the captain and told him that as he had paid me good wages and treated me well I would work with his people the residue of this day for my victuals and half a gallon of molasses which he he would give me My first object now was to get into the hold of the ship with those who were adjusting the cargo The first time the men below called for aid I went to them and being there took care to remain with them Being placed at one side of the hold for the purpose of packing the bags close to the ship's timbers I so managed as to leave a space between two of the bags large enough for a man to creep in and conceal himself This cavity was near the opening in the centre of the hold that was left to let men get down to stow away the last of the bags that were put in In this small hollow retreat amongst the bags of cotton I determined to take my passage to Philadelphia if by any means I could succeed in stealing on board the ship at night When the evening came I went to a store near the wharf and bought two jugs one that held half a gallon and the other a large stone jug holding more than three gallons When it was dark I filled my large jug with water purchased twenty pounds of pilot bread at a bakery which I tied in a large handkerchief and taking my jugs in my hand went on board the ship to receive my molasses of the captain for the labour of the day The captain was not on board and a boy gave me the molasses but under pretence of waiting to see the captain I sat down between two rows of cotton bales that were stowed on deck The night was very dark and watching a favourable opportunity when the man on deck had gone forward succeeded in placing both my jugs upon the bags of cotton that rose in the hold almost to the deck In another moment I glided down amongst the cargo and lost no time in placing my jugs in the place provided for them amongst the bales of cotton beside the lair provided for myself Soon after I had taken my station for the voyage the captain came on board and the boy reported to him that he had paid me off and dismissed me In a short time all was quiet on board the ship except the occasional tread of the man on watch I slept none at all this night the anxiety that oppressed me preventing me from taking any repose Before day the captain was on deck and gave orders to the seamen to clear the ship for sailing and to be ready to descend the river with the ebb tide which was expected to flow at sunrise I felt the motion of the ship when she got under weigh and thought the time long before I heard the breakers of the ocean surging against her sides In the place where I lay when the hatches were closed total darkness prevailed and I had no idea of the lapse of time or of the progress we made until having at one period crept out into the open space between the rows of cotton bags which I have before described I heard a man who appeared from the sound of his voice to be standing on the hatch call out and say That is Cape Hatteras I had already come out of my covert several times into the open space but the hatches were closed so tightly as to exclude all light It appeared to me that we had already been at sea a long time but as darkness was unbroken with me I could not make any computation of periods Soon after this the hatch was opened and the light was let into the hold A man descended for the purpose of examining the state of the cargo who returned in a short time The hatch was again closed and nothing of moment occurred from this time until I heard and felt the ship strike against some solid body In a short time I heard much noise and a multitude of sounds of various kinds All this satisfied me that the ship was in some port for I no longer heard the sound of the waves nor perceived the least motion in the ship At length the hatch was again opened and the light was let in upon me My anxiety now was to escape fromthe ship without being discovered by any one to accomplish which I determined to issue from the hold as soon as night came on if possible Waiting until sometime after daylight had disappeared I ventured to creep to the hatchway and raise my head above deck Seeing no one on board I crawled out of the hold and stepped on board a ship that lay alongside of that in which I had come a passenger Here a man seized me and called me a thief saying I had come to rob his ship and it was with much difficulty that I prevailed upon him to let me go He at length permitted me to go on the wharf and I once more felt myself a freeman I did not know what city I was in but as the sailors had all told me at Savannah that their ship was bound to Philadelphia I had no doubt of being in that city In going along the street a black man met me and I asked him if I was in Philadelphia This question caused the stranger to laugh loudly and he passed on without giving me any answer Soon afterwards I met an old gentleman with drab clothes on as I could see by the light of the lamps To him I propounded the same question that had been addressed a few moment before to the black man This time however I received a civil answer being told that I was in Philadelphia This gentleman seemed concerned for me either because of my wretched and ragged appearance or because I was a stranger and did not know where I was Whether for the one cause or the other I know not but he told me to follow him and led me to the house of a black man not far off whom he directed to take care of me until the morning In this house I was kindly entertained all night and when the morning came the old gentleman in drab clothes returned and brought with him an entire suit of clothes not more than half worn of which he made me a present and gave me money to buy a hat and some muslin for a couple of shirts He then turned to go away and I perceive that thee is a slave and has run away from thy master Thee can now go to work for thy living but take care that they do not catch thee again I then told him that I had been a slave and had twice run away and escaped from the state of Georgia The gentleman seemed a little incredulous of that which I told him but when I explained to him the cause of the condition in which he found me he seemed to become more than ever interested in my fate This gentleman whose name I shall not publish has always been a kind friend to me After remaining in Philadelphia a few weeks I resolved to return to my little farm in Maryland for the purpose of selling my property for as much as it would produce and of bringing my wife and children to Pennsylvania On arriving in Baltimore I went to a tavern keeper whom I had formerly supplied with vegetables from my garden This man appeared greatly surprised to see me and asked me how I had managed to escape from my master in Georgia I told him that the man who had taken me to Georgia was not my master but had kidnapped me and carried me away by violence The tavern keeper then told me that I had better leave Baltimore as soon as possible and showed me a handbill that was stuck up against the wall of his bar-room in which a hundred and fifty dollars reward was offered for my apprehension I immediately left this house and fled from Baltimore that very night When I reached my former residence I found a white man living in it whom I did not know This man on being questioned by me as to the time he had owned this place and the manner in which he had obtained possession informed me that a black man had formerly lived here but he was a runaway slave and his master had come the summer before and carried him off That the wife of the former owner of the house was also a slave and that her master had come about six weeks before the present time and taken her and her children and sold them in Baltimore to a slave-dealer from the south This man also informed me that he was not in this neighbourhood at the time the woman and her children were carried away but that he had received his information from a black woman who lived half a mile off This black woman I was well acquainted with she had been my neighbour and I knew her to be my friend She had been set free some years before by a gentleman of this neighbourhood and resided under his protection on a part of his land I immediately went to the house of this woman who could scarcely believe the evidence of her own eyes when she saw me enter her door The first words she spoke to me were Lucy and her children have all been stolen away At my request she gave me the following account of the manner in which my wife and children all of whom had been free from their birth were seized and driven into southern slavery A few weeks she after they took you away and before Lucy had so far recovered from the terror produced by that event as to remain in her house all night with her children without some other company I went one evening to stay all night with her a kindness that I always rendered her if no other person came to remain with her It was late when we went to bed perhaps eleven o'clock and after we had been asleep some time we were awakened by a loud rap at the door At first we nothing but upon the rap being several times repeated Lucy asked who was there She was then told in a voice that seemed by its sound to be that of a woman to get up and open the door adding that the person without had something to tell her that she wished to hear Lucy supposing the voice to be that of a black woman the slave of a lady living near rose and opened the door but to our astonishment instead of a woman coming in four or five men rushed into the house and immediately closed the door at which one of the men stood with his back against it until the others made a light in the fire place and proceeded deliberately to tie Lucy with a rope Search was then made in the bed for the children and I was found and dragged out This seemed to produce some consternation amongst the captors whose faces were all black but whose hair and visages were those of white men A consultation was held amongst them the object of which was to determine whether I should also be taken along with Lucy and the children or be left behind on account of the interest which my master was supposed to feel for me It was finally agreed that as it would be very dangerous to carry me off lest my old master should cause pursuit to be made after them they would leave me behind and take only Lucy and the children One of the number then it would not do to leave me behind and at liberty as I would immediately go and give intelligence of what I had seen and if the affair should be discovered by the members of the abolition society before they had time to get out of Maryland they would certainly be detected and punished for the crimes they were committing It was finally resolved to tie me with cords to one of the logs of the housegag me by tying a rope in my mouth and confining it closely at the back of my neck They immediately confined me and then took the children from the bed The oldest boy they tied to his mother and compelled them to go out of the house together The three youngest children were then taken out of bed and carried off in the hands of the men who had tied me to the log I never saw nor heard any more of Lucy or her children For myself I remained in the house the door of which was carefully closed and fastened after it was shut until the second night after my confinement without any thing to eat or drink On the second night some unknown persons came and cut the cords that bound me when I returned to my own cabin This intelligence almost deprived me of life it was the most dreadful of all the misfortunes that I had ever suffered It was now clear that some slave-dealer had come in my absence and seized my wife and children as slaves and sold them to such men as I had served in the south They had now passed into hopeless bondage and were gone forever beyond my reach I myself was advertised as a fugitive slave and was liable to be arrested at each moment and dragged back to Georgia I rushed out of my own house in despair and returned to Pennsylvania with a broken heart For the last few years I have resided about fifty miles from Philadelphia where I expect to pass the evening of my life in working hard for my subsistence without the least hope of ever again seeing my wife and children-- fearful at this day to let my place of residence be known lest even yet it may be supposed that as an article of property I am of sufficient value to be worth pursuing in my old age THE END
Frederick,NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS AN AMERICAN SLAVE WRITTEN BY HIMSELF BOSTON PUBLISHED AT THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE No CORNHILL verso Entered according to Act of Congress in the year BY FREDERERICK DOUGLASS In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of Massachusetts iii PREFACE IN the month of August I attended an antislavery convention in Nantucket at which it was my happiness to become acquainted with FREDERICK DOUGLASS the writer of the following Narrative He was a stranger to nearly every member of that body but having recently made his escape from the southern prison-house of bondage and feeling his curiosity excited to ascertain the principles and measures of the abolitionists--of whom he had heard a somewhat vague description while he was a slave--he was induced to give his attendance on the occasion alluded to though at that time a resident in New Bedford Fortunate most fortunate occurrence--fortunate for the millions of his manacled brethren yet panting for deliverance from their awful thraldom--fortunate for the cause of negro emancipation and of universal liberty--fortunate for the land of his birth which he has already done so much to save and bless--fortunate for a large circle of friends and acquaintances whose sympathy and affection he has strongly secured by the many sufferings he has endured by his virtuous traits of character by his ever-abiding remembrance of those who are in bonds as being bound with them --fortunate for the multitudes in various parts of our republic whose minds he has enlightened on the subject of slavery and who have been melted to tears by his pathos or roused to virtuous indignation by his stirring eloquence against the enslavers of men--fortunate for himself as it at once brought him into the iv field of public usefulness gave the world assurance of a MAN quickened the slumbering energies of his soul and consecrated him to the great work of breaking the rod of the oppressor and letting the oppressed go free I shall never forget his first speech at the convention--the extraordinary emotion it excited in my own mind--the powerful impression it created upon a crowded auditory completely taken by surprise--the applause which followed from the beginning to the end of his felicitous remarks I think I never hated slavery so intensely as at that moment certainly my perception of the enormous outrage which is inflicted by it on the godlike nature of its victims was rendered far more clear than ever There stood one in physical proportion and stature commanding and exact--in intellect richly endowed--in natural eloquence a prodigy--in soul manifestly created but a little lower than the angels--yet a slave ay a fugitive slave--trembling for his safety hardly daring to believe that on the American soil a single white person could be found who would befriend him at all hazards for the love of God and humanity Capable of high attainments as an intellectual and moral being--needing nothing but a comparatively small amount of cultivation to make him an ornament to society and a blessing to his race--by the law of the land by the voice of the people by the terms of the slave code he was only a piece of property a beast of burden a chattel personal nevertheless A beloved friend from New Bedford prevailed on Mr DOUGLASS to address the convention He came forward to the platform with a hesitancy and embarrassment necessarily the attendants of a sensitive mind in such a novel position After apologizing for his ignorance and reminding the audience that slavery was a poor school for the human intellect and heart v he proceeded to narrate some of the facts in his own history as a slave and in the course of his speech gave utterance to many noble thoughts and thrilling reflections As soon as he had taken his seat filled with hope and admiration I rose and declared that PATRICK HENRY of revolutionary fame never made a speech more eloquent in the cause of liberty than the one we had just listened to from the lips of that hunted fugitive So I believed at that time--such is my belief now I reminded the audience of the peril which surrounded this self-emancipated young man at the North --even in Massachusetts on the soil of the Pilgrim Fathers among the descendants of revolutionary sires and I appealed to them whether they would ever allow him to be carried back into slavery--law or no law constitution or no constitution The response was unanimous and in thunder-tones--NO Will you succor and protect him as a brother-man--a resident of the old Bay State YES shouted the whole mass with an energy so startling that the ruthless tyrants south of Mason and Dixon's line might almost have heard the mighty burst of feeling and recognized it as the pledge of an invincible determination on the part of those who gave it never to betray him that wanders but to hide the outcast and firmly to abide the consequences It was at once deeply impressed upon my mind that if Mr DOUGLASS could be persuaded to consecrate his time and talents to the promotion of the anti-slavery enterprise a powerful impetus would be given to it and a stunning blow at the same time inflicted on northern prejudice against a colored complexion I therefore endeavored to instil hope and courage into his mind in order that he might dare to engage in a vocation so anomalous and responsible for a person in his situation and I was seconded in this effort by warm-hearted friends especially by the late General vi Agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society Mr JOHN A COLLINS whose judgment in this instance entirely coincided with my own At first he could give no encouragement with unfeigned diffidence he expressed his conviction that he was not adequate to the performance of so great a task the path marked out was wholly an untrodden one he was sincerely apprehensive that he should do more harm than good After much deliberation however he consented to make a trial and ever since that period he has acted as a lecturing agent under the auspices either of the American or the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society In labors he has been most abundant and his success in combating prejudice in gaining proselytes in agitating the public mind has far surpassed the most sanguine expectations that were raised at the commencement of his brilliant career He has borne himself with gentleness and meekness yet with true manliness of character As a public speaker he excels in pathos wit comparison imitation strength of reasoning and fluency of language There is in him that union of head and heart which is indispensable to an enlightenment of the heads and a winning of the hearts of others May his strength continue to be equal to his day May he continue to grow in grace and in the knowledge of God that he may be increasingly serviceable in the cause of bleeding humanity whether at home or abroad It is certainly a very remarkable fact that one of the most efficient advocates of the slave population now before the public is a fugitive slave in the person of FREDERICK DOUGLASS and that the free colored population of the United States are as ably represented by one of their own number in the person of CHARLES LENOX REMOND whose eloquent appeals have extorted the highest applause of multitudes on both sides of the Atlantic Let the calumniators of the colored vii race despise themselves for their baseness and illiberality of spirit and henceforth cease to talk of the natural inferiority of those who require nothing but time and opportunity to attain to the highest point of human excellence It may perhaps be fairly questioned whether any other portion of the population of the earth could have endured the privations sufferings and horrors of slavery without having become more degraded in the scale of humanity than the slaves of African descent Nothing has been left undone to cripple their intellects darken their minds debase their moral nature obliterate all traces of their relationship to mankind and yet how wonderfully they have sustained the mighty load of a most frightful bondage under which they have been groaning for centuries To illustrate the effect of slavery on the white man--to show that he has no powers of endurance in such a condition superior to those of his black brother -- DANIEL O'CONNELL the distinguished advocate of universal emancipation and the mightiest champion of prostrate but not conquered Ireland relates the following anecdote in a speech delivered by him in the Conciliation Hall Dublin before the Loyal National Repeal Association March No matter said Mr O'CONNELL under what specious term it may disguise itself slavery is still hideous It has a natural an inevitable tendency to brutalize every noble faculty of man An American sailor who was cast away on the shore of Africa where he was kept in slavery for three years was at the expiration of that period found to be imbruted and stultified--he had lost all reasoning power and having forgotten his native language could only utter some savage gibberish between Arabic and English which nobody could understand and which even he himself found difficulty in pronouncing So much for the humanizing influence of THE DOMESTIC INSTITUTION viii Admitting this to have been an extraordinary case of mental deterioration it proves at least that the white slave can sink as low in the scale of humanity as the black one Mr DOUGLASS has very properly chosen to write his own Narrative in his own style and according to the best of his ability rather than to employ some one else It is therefore entirely his own production and considering how long and dark was the career he had to run as a slave--how few have been his opportunities to improve his mind since he broke his iron fetters--it is in my judgment highly creditable to his head and heart He who can peruse it without a tearful eye a heaving breast an afflicted spirit--without being filled with an unutterable abhorrence of slavery and all its abettors and animated with a determination to seek the immediate overthrow of that execrable system--without trembling for the fate of this country in the hands of a righteous God who is ever on the side of the oppressed and whose arm is not shortened that it cannot save--must have a flinty heart and be qualified to act the part of a trafficker in slaves and the souls of men I am confident that it is essentially true in all its statements that nothing has been set down in malice nothing exaggerated nothing drawn from the imagination that it comes short of the reality rather than overstates a single fact in regard to SLAVERY AS IT IS The experience of FREDERICK DOUGLASS as a slave was not a peculiar one his lot was not especially a hard one his case may be regarded as a very fair specimen of the treatment of slaves in Maryland in which State it is conceded that they are better fed and less cruelly treated than in Georgia Alabama or Louisiana Many have suffered incomparably more while very few on the plantations have suffered less than himself Yet how deplorable was his situation what terrible chastisements were ix inflicted upon his person what still more shocking outrages were perpetrated upon his mind with all his noble powers and sublime aspirations how like a brute was he treated even by those professing to have the same mind in them that was in Christ Jesus to what dreadful liabilities was he continually subjected how destitute of friendly counsel and aid even in his greatest extremities how heavy was the midnight of woe which shrouded in blackness the last ray of hope and filled the future with terror and gloom what longings after freedom took possession of his breast and how his misery augmented in proportion as he grew reflective and intelligent--thus demonstrating that a happy slave is an extinct man how he thought reasoned felt under the lash of the driver with the chains upon his limbs what perils he encountered in his endeavors to escape from his horrible doom and how signal have been his deliverance and preservation in the midst of a nation of pitiless enemies This Narrative contains many affecting incidents many passages of great eloquence and power but I think the most thrilling one of them all is the description DOUGLASS gives of his feelings as he stood soliloquizing respecting his fate and the chances of his one day being a freeman on the banks of the Chesapeake Bay--viewing the receding vessels as they flew with their white wings before the breeze and apostrophizing them as animated by the living spirit of freedom Who can read that passage and be insensible to its pathos and sublimity Compressed into it is a whole Alexandrian library of thought feeling and sentiment--all that can all that need be urged in the form of expostulation entreaty rebuke against that crime of crimes--making man the property of his fellow-man O how accursed is that system which entombs the godlike mind of man defaces the divine image reduces those who by creation were crowned x with glory and honor to a level with four-footed beasts and exalts the dealer in human flesh above all that is called God Why should its existence be prolonged one hour Is it not evil only evil and that continually What does its presence imply but the absence of all fear of God all regard for man on the part of the people of the United States Heaven speed its eternal overthrow So profoundly ignorant of the nature of slavery are many persons that they are stubbornly incredulous whenever they read or listen to any recital of the cruelties which are daily inflicted on its victims They do not deny that the slaves are held as property but that terrible fact seems to convey to their minds no idea of injustice exposure to outrage or savage barbarity Tell them of cruel scourgings of mutilations and brandings of scenes of pollution and blood of the banishment of all light and knowledge and they affect to be greatly indignant at such enormous exaggerations such wholesale misstatements such abominable libels on the character of the southern planters As if all these direful outrages were not the natural results of slavery As if it were less cruel to reduce a human being to the condition of a thing than to give him a severe flagellation or to deprive him of necessary food and clothing As if whips chains thumb-screws paddles bloodhounds overseers drivers patrols were not all indispensable to keep the slaves down and to give protection to their ruthless oppressors As if when the marriage institution is abolished concubinage adultery and incest must not necessarily abound when all the rights of humanity are annihilated any barrier remains to protect the victim from the fury of the spoiler when absolute power is assumed over life and liberty it will not be wielded with destructive sway Skeptics of this character abound in society In some few instances their incredulity arises from a want of xi reflection but generally it indicates a hatred of the light a desire to shield slavery from the assaults of its foes a contempt of the colored race whether bond or free Such will try to discredit the shocking tales of slaveholding cruelty which are recorded in this truthful Narrative but they will labor in vain Mr DOUGLASS has frankly disclosed the place of his birth the names of those who claimed ownership in his body and soul and the names also of those who committed the crimes which he has alleged against them His statements therefore may easily be disproved if they are untrue In the course of his Narrative he relates two instances of murderous cruelty--in one of which a planter deliberately shot a slave belonging to a neighboring plantation who had unintentionally gotten within his lordly domain in quest of fish and in the other an overseer blew out the brains of a slave who had fled to a stream of water to escape a bloody scourging Mr DOUGLASS states that in neither of these instances was any thing done by way of legal arrest or judicial investigation The Baltimore American of March relates a similar case of atrocity perpetrated with similar impunity--as follows--Shooting a Slave--We learn upon the authority of a letter from Charles county Maryland received by a gentleman of this city that a young man named Matthews a nephew of General Matthews and whose father it is believed holds an office at Washington killed one of the slaves upon his father's farm by shooting him The letter states that young Matthews had been left in charge of the farm that he gave an order to the servant which was disobeyed when he proceeded to the house obtained a gun and returning shot the servant He immediately the letter continues fled to his father's residence where he still remains unmolested--Let it never be forgotten that no slaveholder or xii overseer can be convicted of any outrage perpetrated on the person of a slave however diabolical it may be on the testimony of colored witnesses whether bond or free By the slave code they are adjudged to be as incompetent to testify against a white man as though they were indeed a part of the brute creation Hence there is no legal protection in fact whatever there may be in form for the slave population and any amount of cruelty may be inflicted on them with impunity Is it possible for the human mind to conceive of a more horrible state of society The effect of a religious profession on the conduct of southern masters is vividly described in the following Narrative and shown to be any thing but salutary In the nature of the case it must be in the highest degree pernicious The testimony of Mr DOUGLASS on this point is sustained by a cloud of witnesses whose veracity is unimpeachable A slaveholder's profession of Christianity is a palpable imposture He is a felon of the highest grade He is a man-stealer It is of no importance what you put in the other scale Reader are you with the man-stealers in sympathy and purpose or on the side of their down-trodden victims If with the former then are you the foe of God and man If with the latter what are you prepared to do and dare in their behalf Be faithful be vigilant be untiring in your efforts to break every yoke and let the oppressed go free Come what may--cost what it may--inscribe on the banner which you unfurl to the breeze as your religious and political motto--NO COMPROMISE WITH SLAVERY NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS WM LLOYD GARRISON BOSTON May xiii LETTER FROM WENDELL PHILLIPS ESQ BOSTON April My Dear Friend You remember the old fable of The Man and the Lion where the lion complained that he should not be so misrepresented when the lions write history I am glad the time has come when the lions write history We have been left long enough to gather character of slavery from the involuntary evidence of the masters One might indeed rest sufficiently satisfied with what it is evident must be in general the results of such a relation without seeking farther to find whether they have followed in every instance Indeed those who stare at the half-peck of corn a week and love to count the lashes on the slave's back are seldom the stuff out of which reformers and abolitionists are to be made I remember that in many were waiting for the results of the West India experiment before they could come into our ranks Those results have come long ago but alas few of that number have come with them as converts A man must be disposed to judge of emancipation by other tests than whether it has increased the produce of sugar--and to hate slavery for other reasons because it starves men and whips women--before he is ready to lay the first stone of his anti-slavery life xiv I was glad to learn in your story how early the most neglected of God's children waken to a sense of their rights and of the injustice done them Experience is a keen teacher and long before you had mastered your A B C or knew where the white sails of the Chesapeake were bound you began I see to gauge the wretchedness of the slave not by his hunger and want not by his lashes and toil but by the cruel and blighting death which gathers over his soul In connection with this there is one circumstance which makes your recollections peculiarly valuable and renders your early insight the more remarkable You come from that part of the country where we are told slavery appears with its fairest features Let us hear then what it is at its best estate--gaze on its bright side if it has one and then imagination may task her powers to add dark lines to the picture as she travels southward to that for the colored man Valley of the Shadow of Death where the Mississippi sweeps along Again we have known you long and can put the most entire confidence in your truth candor and sincerity Every one who has heard you speak has felt and I am confident every one who reads your book will feel persuaded that you give them a fair specimen of the whole truth No one-sided portrait--no wholesale complaints-- but strict justice done whenever individual kindliness has neutralized for a moment the deadly system with which it was strangely allied You have been with us too some years and can fairly compare the twilight of rights which your race enjoy at the North with that noon of night under which they labor south of Mason and Dixon's line Tell us whether after all the half-free colored man of Massachusetts is worse off than the pampered slave of the rice swamps In reading your life no one can say that we have xv unfairly picked out some rare specimens of cruelty We know that the bitter drops which even you have drained from the cup are no incidental aggravations no individual ills but such as must mingle always and necessarily in the lot of every slave They are the essential ingredients not the occasional results of the system After all I shall read your book with trembling for you Some years ago when you were beginning to tell me your real name and birthplace you may remember I stopped you and preferred to remain ignorant of all With the exception of a vague description so I continued till the other day when you read me your memoirs I hardly knew at the time whether to thank you or not for the sight of them when I reflected that it was still dangerous in Massachusetts for honest men to tell their names They say the fathers in signed the Declaration of Independence with the halter about their necks You too publish your declaration of freedom with danger compassing you around In all the broad lands which the Constitution of the United States overshadows there is no single spot--however narrow or desolate--where a fugitive slave can plant himself and say I am safe The whole armory of Northern Law has no shield for you I am free to say that in your place I should throw the MS into the fire You perhaps may tell your story in safety endeared as you are to so many warm hearts by rare gifts and a still rarer devotion of them to the service of others But it will be owing only to your labors and the fearless efforts of those who trampling the laws and Constitution of the country under their feet are determined that they will hide the outcast and that their hearths shall be spite of the law an asylum for the oppressed if some time or other the humblest may stand in our xvi streets and bear witness in safety against the cruelties of which he has been the victim Yet it is sad to think that these very throbbing hearts which welcome your story and form your best safeguard in telling it are all beating contrary to the statute in such case made and provided Go on my dear friend till you and those who like you have been saved so as by fire from the dark prison-house shall stereotype these free illegal pulses into statutes and New England cutting loose from a blood-stained Union shall glory in being the house of refuge for the oppressed--till we no longer merely hide the outcast or make a merit of standing idly by while he is hunted in our midst but consecrating anew the soil of the Pilgrims as an asylum for the oppressed proclaim our welcome to the slave so loudly that the tones shall reach every hut in the Carolinas and make the broken-hearted bondman leap up at the thought of old Massachusetts God speed the day Till then and ever Yours truly WENDELL PHILLIPS FREDERICK DOUGLASS I I WAS born in Tuckahoe near Hillsborough and about twelve miles from Easton in Talbot county Maryland I have no accurate knowledge of my age never having seen any authentic record containing it By far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday They seldom come nearer to it than planting-time harvest-time cherry-time spring-time or fall-time A want of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood The white children could tell their ages I could not tell why I ought to be deprived of the same privilege I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper and impertinent and evidence of a restless spirit The nearest estimate I can give makes me now between twenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age I come to this from hearing my master say some time during I was about seventeen years old My mother was named Harriet Bailey She was the daughter of Isaac and Betsey Bailey both colored and quite dark My mother was of a darker complexion than either my grandmother or grandfather My father was a white man He was admitted to be such by all I ever heard speak of my parentage The opinion was also whispered that my master was my father but of the correctness of this opinion I know nothing the means of knowing was withheld from me My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant--before I knew her as my mother It is a common custom in the part of Maryland from which I ran away to part children from their mothers at a very early age Frequently before the child has reached its twelfth month its mother is taken from it and hired out on some farm a considerable distance off and the child is placed under the care of an old woman too old for field labor For what this separation is done I do not know unless it be to hinder the development of the child's affection toward its mother and to blunt and destroy the natural affection of the mother for the child This is the inevitable result I never saw my mother to know her as such more than four or five times in my life and each of these times was very short in duration and at night She was hired by a Mr Stewart who lived about twelve miles from my home She made her journeys to see me in the night travelling the whole distance on foot after the performance of her day's work She was a field hand and a whipping is the penalty of not being in the field at sunrise unless a slave has special permission from his or her master to the contrary--a permission which they seldom get and one that gives to him that gives it the proud name of being a kind master I do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light of day She was with me in the night She would lie down with me and get me to sleep but long before I waked she was gone Very little communication ever took place between us Death soon ended what little we could have while she lived and with it her hardships and suffering She died when I was about seven years old on one of my master's farms near Lee's Mill I was not allowed to be present during her illness at her death or burial She was gone long before I knew any thing about it Never having enjoyed to any considerable extent her soothing presence her tender and watchful care I received the tidings of her death with much the same emotions I should have probably felt at the death of a stranger Called thus suddenly away she left me without the slightest intimation of who my father was The whisper that my master was my father may or may not be true and true or false it is of but little consequence to my purpose whilst the fact remains in all its glaring odiousness that slaveholders have ordained and by law established that the children of slave women shall in all cases follow the condition of their mothers and this is done too obviously to administer to their own lusts and make a gratification of their wicked desires profitable as well as pleasurable for by this cunning arrangement the slaveholder in cases not a few sustains to his slaves the double relation of master and father I know of such cases and it is worthy of remark that such slaves invariably suffer greater hardships and have more to contend with than others They are in the first place a constant offence to their mistress She is ever disposed to find fault with them they can seldom do any thing to please her she is never better pleased than when she sees them under the lash especially when she suspects her husband of showing to his mulatto children favors which he withholds from his black slaves The master is frequently compelled to sell this class of his slaves out of deference to the feelings of his white wife and cruel as the deed may strike any one to be for a man to sell his own children to human flesh-mongers it is often the dictate of humanity for him to do so for unless he does this he must not only whip them himself but must stand by and see one white son tie up his brother of but few shades darker complexion than himself and ply the gory lash to his naked back and if he lisp one word of disapproval it is set down to his parental partiality and only makes a bad matter worse both for himself and the slave whom he would protect and defend Every year brings with it multitudes of this class of slaves It was doubtless in consequence of a knowledge of this fact that one great statesman of the south predicted the downfall of slavery by the inevitable laws of population Whether this prophecy is ever fulfilled or not it is nevertheless plain that a very different-looking class of people are springing up at the south and are now held in slavery from those originally brought to this country from Africa and if their increase will do no other good it will do away the force of the argument that God cursed Ham and therefore American slavery is right If the lineal descendants of Ham are alone to be scripturally enslaved it is certain that slavery at the south must soon become unscriptural for thousands are ushered into the world annually who like myself owe their existence to white fathers and those fathers most frequently their own masters I have had two masters My first master's name was Anthony I do not remember his first name He was generally called Captain Anthony--a title which I presume he acquired by sailing a craft on the Chesapeake Bay He was not considered a rich slaveholder He owned two or three farms and about thirty slaves His farms and slaves were under the care of an overseer The overseer's name was Plummer Mr Plummer was a miserable drunkard a profane swearer and a savage monster He always went armed with a cowskin and a heavy cudgel I have known him to cut and slash the women's heads so horribly that even master would be enraged at his cruelty and would threaten to whip him if he did not mind himself Master however was not a humane slaveholder It required extraordinary barbarity on the part of an overseer to affect him He was a cruel man hardened by a long life of slaveholding He would at times seem to take great pleasure in whipping a slave I have often been awakened at the dawn of day by the most heart-rending shrieks of an own aunt of mine whom he used to tie up to a joist and whip upon her naked back till she was literally covered with blood No words no tears no prayers from his gory victim seemed to move his iron heart from its bloody purpose The louder she screamed the harder he whipped and where the blood ran fastest there he whipped longest He would whip her to make her scream and whip her to make her hush and not until overcome by fatigue would he cease to swing the blood-clotted cowskin I remember the first time I ever witnessed this horrible exhibition I was quite a child but I well remember it I never shall forget it whilst I remember any thing It was the first of a long series of such outrages of which I was doomed to be a witness and a participant It struck me with awful force It was the blood-stained gate the entrance to the hell of slavery through which I was about to pass It was a most terrible spectacle I wish I could commit to paper the feelings with which I beheld it This occurrence took place very soon after I went to live with my old master and under the following circumstances Aunt Hester went out one night--where or for what I do not know--and happened to be absent when my master desired her presence He had ordered her not to go out evenings and warned her that she must never let him catch her in company with a young man who was paying attention to her belonging to Colonel Lloyd The young man's name was Ned Roberts generally called Lloyd's Ned Why master was so careful of her may be safely left to conjecture She was a woman of noble form and of graceful proportions having very few equals and fewer superiors in personal appearance among the colored or white women of our neighborhood Aunt Hester had not only disobeyed his orders in going out but had been found in company with Lloyd's Ned which circumstance I found from what he said while whipping her was the chief offence Had he been a man of pure morals himself he might have been thought interested in protecting the innocence of my aunt but those who knew him will not suspect him of any such virtue Before he commenced whipping Aunt Hester he took her into the kitchen and stripped her from neck to waist leaving her neck shoulders and back entirely naked He then told her to cross her hands calling her at the same time a d--d b--h After crossing her hands he tied them with a strong rope and led her to a stool under a large hook in the joist put in for the purpose He made her get upon the stool and tied her hands to the hook She now stood fair for his infernal purpose Her arms were stretched up at their full length so that she stood upon the ends of her toes He then said to her Now you d--d b--h I'll learn you how to disobey my orders and after rolling up his sleeves be commenced to lay on the heavy cowskin and soon the warm red blood amid heart-rending shrieks from her and horrid oaths from him came dripping to the floor I was so terrified and horror-stricken at the sight that I hid myself in a closet and dared not venture out till long after the bloody transaction was over I expected it would be my turn next It was all new to me I had never seen any thing like it before I had always lived with my grandmother on the outskirts of the plantation where she was put to raise the children of the younger women I had therefore been until now out of the way of the bloody scenes that often occurred on the plantation II My master's family consisted of two sons Andrew and Richard one daughter Lucretia and her husband Captain Thomas Auld They lived in one house upon the home plantation of Colonel Edward Lloyd My master was Colonel Lloyd's clerk and superintendent He was what might be called the overseer of the overseers I spent two years of childhood on this plantation in my old master's family It was here that I witnessed the bloody transaction recorded in the first and as I received my first impressions of slavery on this plantation I will give some description of it and of slavery as it there existed The plantation is about twelve miles north of Easton in Talbot county and is situated on the border of Miles River The principal products raised upon it were tobacco corn and wheat These were raised in great abundance so that with the products of this and the other farms belonging to him he was able to keep in almost constant employment a large sloop in carrying them to market at Baltimore This sloop was named Sally Lloyd in honor of one of the colonel's daughters My master's son-in-law Captain Auld was master of the vessel she was otherwise manned by the colonel's own slaves Their names were Peter Isaac Rich and Jake These were esteemed very highly by the other slaves and looked upon as the privileged ones of the plantation for it was no small affair in the eyes of the slaves to be allowed to see Baltimore Colonel Lloyd kept from three to four hundred slaves on his home plantation and owned a large number more on the neighboring farms belonging to him The names of the farms nearest to the home plantation were Wye Town and New Design Wye Town was under the overseership of a man named Noah Willis New Design was under the overseership of a Mr Townsend The overseers of these and all the rest of the farms numbering over twenty received advice and direction from the managers of the home plantation This was the great business place It was the seat of government for the whole twenty farms All disputes among the overseers were settled here If a slave was convicted of any high misdemeanor became unmanageable or evinced a determination to run away he was brought immediately here severely whipped put on board the sloop carried to Baltimore and sold to Austin Woolfolk or some other slave-trader as a warning to the slaves remaining Here too the slaves of all the other farms received their monthly allowance of food and their yearly clothing The men and women slaves received as their monthly allowance of food eight pounds of pork or its equivalent in fish and one bushel of corn meal Their yearly clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts one pair of linen trousers like the shirts one jacket one pair of trousers for winter made of coarse negro cloth one pair of stockings and one pair of shoes the whole of which could not have cost more than seven dollars The allowance of the slave children was given to their mothers or the old women having the care of them The children unable to work in the field had neither shoes stockings jackets nor trousers given to them their clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts per year When these failed them they went naked until the next allowance-day Children from seven to ten years old of both sexes almost naked might be seen at all seasons of the year There were no beds given the slaves unless one coarse blanket be considered such and none but the men and women had these This however is not considered a very great privation They find less difficulty from the want of beds than from the want of time to sleep for when their day's work in the field is done the most of them having their washing mending and cooking to do and having few or none of the ordinary facilities for doing either of these very many of their sleeping hours are consumed in preparing for the field the coming day and when this is done old and young male and female married and single drop down side by side on one common bed--the cold damp floor--each covering himself or herself with their miserable blankets and here they sleep till they are summoned to the field by the driver's horn At the sound of this all must rise and be off to the field There must be no halting every one must be at his or her post and woe betides them who hear not this morning summons to the field for if they are not awakened by the sense of hearing they are by the sense of feeling no age nor sex finds any favor Mr Severe the overseer used to stand by the door of the quarter armed with a large hickory stick and heavy cowskin ready to whip any one who was so unfortunate as not to hear or from any other cause was prevented from being ready to start for the field at the sound of the horn Mr Severe was rightly named he was a cruel man I have seen him whip a woman causing the blood to run half an hour at the time and this too in the midst of her crying children pleading for their mother's release He seemed to take pleasure in manifesting his fiendish barbarity Added to his cruelty he was a profane swearer It was enough to chill the blood and stiffen the hair of an ordinary man to hear him talk Scarce a sentence escaped him but that was commenced or concluded by some horrid oath The field was the place to witness his cruelty and profanity His presence made it both the field of blood and of blasphemy From the rising till the going down of the sun he was cursing raving cutting and slashing among the slaves of the field in the most frightful manner His career was short He died very soon after I went to Colonel Lloyd's and he died as he lived uttering with his dying groans bitter curses and horrid oaths His death was regarded by the slaves as the result of a merciful providence Mr Severe's place was filled by a Mr Hopkins He was a very different man He was less cruel less profane and made less noise than Mr Severe His course was characterized by no extraordinary demonstrations of cruelty He whipped but seemed to take no pleasure in it He was called by the slaves a good overseer The home plantation of Colonel Lloyd wore the appearance of a country village All the mechanical operations for all the farms were performed here The shoemaking and mending the blacksmithing cartwrighting coopering weaving and grain-grinding were all performed by the slaves on the home plantation The whole place wore a business-like aspect very unlike the neighboring farms The number of houses too conspired to give it advantage over the neighboring farms It was called by the slaves the Great House Farm Few privileges were esteemed higher by the slaves of the out-farms than that of being selected to do errands at the Great House Farm It was associated in their minds with greatness A representative could not be prouder of his election to a seat in the American Congress than a slave on one of the out-farms would be of his election to do errands at the Great House Farm They regarded it as evidence of great confidence reposed in them by their overseers and it was on this account as well as a constant desire to be out of the field from under the driver's lash that they esteemed it a high privilege one worth careful living for He was called the smartest and most trusty fellow who had this honor conferred upon him the most frequently The competitors for this office sought as diligently to please their overseers as the office-seekers in the political parties seek to please and deceive the people The same traits of character might be seen in Colonel Lloyd's slaves as are seen in the slaves of the political parties The slaves selected to go to the Great House Farm for the monthly allowance for themselves and their fellow-slaves were peculiarly enthusiastic While on their way they would make the dense old woods for miles around reverberate with their wild songs revealing at once the highest joy and the deepest sadness They would compose and sing as they went along consulting neither time nor tune The thought that came up came out--if not in the word in the sound --and as frequently in the one as in the other They would sometimes sing the most pathetic sentiment in the most rapturous tone and the most rapturous sentiment in the most pathetic tone Into all of their songs they would manage to weave something of the Great House Farm Especially would they do this when leaving home They would then sing most exultingly the following words-- I am going away to the Great House Farm O yea O yea O This they would sing as a chorus to words which to many would seem unmeaning jargon but which nevertheless were full of meaning to themselves I have sometimes thought that the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress some minds with the horrible character of slavery than the reading of whole volumes of philosophy on the subject could do I did not when a slave understand the deep meaning of those rude and apparently incoherent songs I was myself within the circle so that I neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear They told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension they were tones loud long and deep they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish Every tone was a testimony against slavery and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirit and filled me with ineffable sadness I have frequently found myself in tears while hearing them The mere recurrence to those songs even now afflicts me and while I am writing these lines an expression of feeling has already found its way down my cheek To those songs I trace my first glimmering conception of the dehumanizing character of slavery I can never get rid of that conception Those songs still follow me to deepen my hatred of slavery and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds If any one wishes to be impressed with the soul-killing effects of slavery let him go to Colonel Lloyd's plantation and on allowance-day place himself in the deep pine woods and there let him in silence analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his soul--and if he is not thus impressed it will only be because there is no flesh in his obdurate heart I have often been utterly astonished since I came to the north to find persons who could speak of the singing among slaves as evidence of their contentment and happiness It is impossible to conceive of a greater mistake Slaves sing most when they are most unhappy The songs of the slave represent the sorrows of his heart and he is relieved by them only as an aching heart is relieved by its tears At least such is my experience I have often sung to drown my sorrow but seldom to express my happiness Crying for joy and singing for joy were alike uncommon to me while in the jaws of slavery The singing of a man cast away upon a desolate island might be as appropriately considered as evidence of contentment and happiness as the singing of a slave the songs of the one and of the other are prompted by the same emotion III COLONEL LLOYD kept a large and finely cultivated garden which afforded almost constant employment for four men besides the chief gardener Mr M'Durmond This garden was probably the greatest attraction of the place During the summer months people came from far and near--from Baltimore Easton and Annapolis--to see it It abounded in fruits of almost every description from the hardy apple of the north to the delicate orange of the south This garden was not the least source of trouble on the plantation Its excellent fruit was quite a temptation to the hungry swarms of boys as well as the older slaves belonging to the colonel few of whom had the virtue or the vice to resist it Scarcely a day passed during the summer but that some slave had to take the lash for stealing fruit The colonel had to resort to all kinds of stratagems to keep his slaves out of the garden The last most successful one was that of tarring his fence all around after which if a slave was caught with any tar upon his person it was deemed sufficient proof that he had either been into the garden or had tried to get in In either case he was severely whipped by the chief gardener This plan worked well the slaves became as fearful of tar as of the lash They seemed to realize the impossibility of touching tar without being defiled The colonel also kept a splendid riding equi His stable and carriage-house presented the appearance of some of our large city livery establishments His horses were of the finest form and noblest blood His carriage-house contained three splendid coaches three or four gigs besides dearborns and barouches of the most fashionable style This establishment was under the care of two slaves-- old Barney and young Barney--father and son To attend to this establishment was their sole work But it was by no means an easy employment for in nothing was Colonel Lloyd more particular than in the management of his horses The slightest inattention to these was unpardonable and was visited upon those under whose care they were placed with the severest punishment no excuse could shield them if the colonel only suspected any want of attention to his horses--a supposition which he frequently indulged and one which of course made the office of old and young Barney a very trying one They never knew when they were safe from punishment They were frequently whipped when least deserving and escaped whipping when most deserving it Every thing depended upon the looks of the horses and the state of Colonel Lloyd's own mind when his horses were brought to him for use If a horse did not move fast enough or hold his head high enough it was owing to some fault of his keepers It was painful to stand near the stable-door and hear the various complaints against the keepers when a horse was taken out for use This horse has not had proper attention He has not been sufficiently rubbed and curried or he has not been properly fed his food was too wet or too dry he got it too soon or too late he was too hot or too cold he had too much hay and not enough of grain or he had too much grain and not enough of hay instead of old Barney's attending to the horse he had very improperly left it to his son To all these complaints no matter how unjust the slave must answer never a word Colonel Lloyd could not brook any contradiction from a slave When he spoke a slave must stand listen and tremble and such was literally the case I have seen Colonel Lloyd make old Barney a man between fifty and sixty years of age uncover his bald head kneel down upon the cold damp ground and receive upon his naked and toil-worn shoulders more than thirty lashes at the time Colonel Lloyd had three sons--Edward Murray and Daniel--and three sons-in-law Mr Winder Mr Nicholson and Mr Lowndes All of these lived at the Great House Farm and enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they pleased from old Barney down to William Wilkes the coach-driver I have seen Winder make one of the house-servants stand off from him a suitable distance to be touched with the end of his whip and at every stroke raise great ridges upon his back To describe the wealth of Colonel Lloyd would be almost equal to describing the riches of Job He kept from ten to fifteen house-servants He was said to own a thousand slaves and I think this estimate quite within the truth Colonel Lloyd owned so many that he did not know them when he saw them nor did all the slaves of the out-farms know him It is reported of him that while riding along the road one day he met a colored man and addressed him in the usual manner of speaking to colored people on the public highways of the south Well boy whom do you belong to To Colonel Lloyd replied the slave Well does the colonel treat you well No sir was the ready reply What does he work you too hard Yea sir Well don't he give you enough to eat Yes sir he gives me enough such as it is The colonel after ascertaining where the slave belonged rode on the man also went on about his business not dreaming that be had been conversing with his master He thought said and heard nothing more of the matter until two or three weeks afterwards The poor man was then informed by his overseer that for having found fault with his master he was now to be sold to a Georgia trader He was immediately chained and handcuffed and thus without a moment's warning he was snatched away and forever sundered from his family and friends by a hand more unrelenting than death This is the penalty of telling the truth of telling the simple truth in answer to a series of plain questions It is partly in consequence of such facts that slaves when inquired of as to their condition and the character of their masters almost universally say they are contented and that their masters are kind The slaveholders have been known to send in spies among their slaves to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition The frequency of this has had the effect to establish among the slaves the maxim that a still tongue makes a wise head They suppress the truth rather than take the consequences of telling it and in so doing prove themselves a part of the human family If they have any thing to say of their masters it is generally in their masters' favor especially when speaking to an untried man I have been frequently asked when a slave if I had a kind master and do not remember ever to have given a negative answer nor did I in pursuing this course consider myself as uttering what was absolutely false for I always measured the kindness of my master by the standard of kindness set up among slaveholders around us Moreover slaves are like other people and imbibe prejudices quite common to others They think their own better than that of others Many under the influence of this prejudice think their own masters are better than the masters of other slaves and this too in some cases when the very reverse is true Indeed it is not uncommon for slaves even to fall out and quarrel among themselves about the relative goodness of their masters each contending for the superior goodness of his own over that of the others At the very same time they mutually execrate their masters when viewed separately It was so on our plantation When Colonel Lloyd's slaves met the slaves of Jacob Jepson they seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters Colonel Lloyd's slaves contending that he was the richest and Mr Jepson's slaves that he was the smartest and most of a man Colonel Lloyd's slaves would boast his ability to buy and sell Jacob Jepson Mr Jepson's slaves would boast his ability to whip Colonel Lloyd These quarrels would almost always end in a fight between the parties and those that whipped were supposed to have gained the point at issue They seemed to think that the greatness of their masters was transferable to themselves It was considered as being bad enough to be a slave but to be a poor man's slave was deemed a disgrace indeed IV MR HOPKINS remained but a short time in the office of overseer Why his career was so short I do not know but suppose he lacked the necessary severity to suit Colonel Lloyd Mr Hopkins was succeeded by Mr Austin Gore a man possessing in an eminent degree all those traits of character indispensable to what is called a first-rate overseer Mr Gore had served Colonel Lloyd in the capacity of overseer upon one of the out-farms and had shown himself worthy of the high station of overseer upon the home or Great House Farm Mr Gore was proud ambitious and persevering He was artful cruel and obdurate He was just the man for such a place and it was just the place for such a man It afforded scope for the full exercise of all his powers and he seemed to be perfectly at home in it He was one of those who could torture the slightest look word or gesture on the part of the slave into impudence and would treat it accordingly There must be no answering back to him no explanation was allowed a slave showing himself to have been wrongfully accused Mr Gore acted fully up to the maxim laid down by slaveholders--It is better that a dozen slaves suffer under the lash than that the overseer should be convicted in the presence of the slaves of having been at fault No matter how innocent a slave might be--it availed him nothing when accused by Mr Gore of any misdemeanor To be accused was to be convicted and to be convicted was to be punished the one always following the other with immutable certainty To escape punishment was to escape accusation and few slaves had the fortune to do either under the overseership of Mr Gore He was just proud enough to demand the most debasing homage of the slave and quite servile enough to crouch himself at the feet of the master He was ambitious enough to be contented with nothing short of the highest rank of overseers and persevering enough to reach the height of his ambition He was cruel enough to inflict the severest punishment artful enough to descend to the lowest trickery and obdurate enough to be insensible to the voice of a reproving conscience He was of all the overseers the most dreaded by the slaves His presence was painful his eye flashed confusion and seldom was his sharp shrill voice heard without producing horror and trembling in their ranks Mr Gore was a grave man and though a young man he indulged in no jokes said no funny words seldom smiled His words were in perfect keeping with his looks and his looks were in perfect keeping with his words Overseers will sometimes indulge in a witty word even with the slaves not so with Mr Gore He spoke but to command and commanded but to be obeyed he dealt sparingly with his words and bountifully with his whip never using the former where the latter would answer as well When he whipped he seemed to do so from a sense of duty and feared no consequences He did nothing reluctantly no matter how disagreeable always at his post never inconsistent He never promised but to fulfil He was in a word a man of the most inflexible firmness and stone-like coolness His savage barbarity was equalled only by the consummate coolness with which he committed the grossest and most savage deeds upon the slaves under his charge Mr Gore once undertook to whip one of Colonel Lloyd's slaves by the name of Demby He had given Demby but few stripes when to get rid of the scourging he ran and plunged himself into a creek and stood there at the depth of his shoulders refusing to come out Mr Gore told him that he would give him three calls and that if he did not come out at the third call he would shoot him The first call was given Demby made no response but stood his ground The second and third calls were given with the same result Mr Gore then without consultation or deliberation with any one not even giving Demby an additional call raised his musket to his face taking deadly aim at his standing victim and in an instant poor Demby was no more His mangled body sank out of sight and blood and brains marked the water where he had stood A thrill of horror flashed through every soul upon the plantation excepting Mr Gore He alone seemed cool and collected He was asked by Colonel Lloyd and my old master why he resorted to this extraordinary expedient His reply was as well as I can remember that Demby had become unmanageable He was setting a dangerous example to the other slaves--one which if suffered to pass without some such demonstration on his part would finally lead to the total subversion of all rule and order upon the plantation He argued that if one slave refused to be corrected and escaped with his life the other slaves would soon copy the example the result of which would be the freedom of the slaves and the enslavement of the whites Mr Gore's defence was satisfactory He was continued in his station as overseer upon the home plantation His fame as an overseer went abroad His horrid crime was not even submitted to judicial investigation It was committed in the presence of slaves and they of course could neither institute a suit nor testify against him and thus the guilty perpetrator of one of the bloodiest and most foul murders goes unwhipped of justice and uncensured by the community in which he lives Mr Gore lived in St Michael's Talbot county Maryland when I left there and if he is still alive he very probably lives there now and if so he is now as he was then as highly esteemed and as much respected as though his guilty soul had not been stained with his brother's blood I speak advisedly when I say this--that killing a slave or any colored person in Talbot county Maryland is not treated as a crime either by the courts or the community Mr Thomas Lanman of St Michael's killed two slaves one of whom he killed with a hatchet by knocking his brains out He used to boast of the commission of the awful and bloody deed I have heard him do so laughingly saying among other things that he was the only benefactor of his country in the company and that when others would do as much as he had done we should be relieved of the d--d niggers The wife of Mr Giles Hick living but a short distance from where I used to live murdered my wife's cousin a young girl between fifteen and sixteen years of age mangling her person in the most horrible manner breaking her nose and breastbone with a stick so that the poor girl expired in a few hours afterward She was immediately buried but had not been in her untimely grave but a few hours before she was taken up and examined by the coroner who decided that she had come to her death by severe beating The offence for which this girl was thus murdered was this-- She had been set that night to mind Mrs Hick's baby and during the night she fell asleep and the baby cried She having lost her rest for several nights previous did not hear the crying They were both in the room with Mrs Hicks Mrs Hicks finding the girl slow to move jumped from her bed seized an oak stick of wood by the fireplace and with it broke the girl's nose and breastbone and thus ended her life I will not say that this most horrid murder produced no sensation in the community It did produce sensation but not enough to bring the murderess to punishment There was a warrant issued for her arrest but it was never served Thus she escaped not only punishment but even the pain of being arraigned before a court for her horrid crime Whilst I am detailing bloody deeds which took place during my stay on Colonel Lloyd's plantation I will briefly narrate another which occurred about the same time as the murder of Demby by Mr Gore Colonel Lloyd's slaves were in the habit of spending a part of their nights and Sundays in fishing for oysters and in this way made up the deficiency of their scanty allowance An old man belonging to Colonel Lloyd while thus engaged happened to get beyond the limits of Colonel Lloyd's and on the premises of Mr Beal Bondly At this trespass Mr Bondly took offence and with his musket came down to the shore and blew its deadly contents into the poor old man Mr Bondly came over to see Colonel Lloyd the next day whether to pay him for his property or to justify himself in what he had done I know not At any rate this whole fiendish transaction was soon hushed up There was very little said about it at all and nothing done It was a common saying even among little white boys that it was worth a half-cent to kill a nigger and a half-cent to bury one V As to my own treatment while I lived on Colonel Lloyd's plantation it was very similar to that of the other slave children I was not old enough to work in the field and there being little else than field work to do I had a great deal of leisure time The most I had to do was to drive up the cows at evening keep the fowls out of the garden keep the front yard clean and run of errands for my old master's daughter Mrs Lucretia Auld The most of my leisure time I spent in helping Master Daniel Lloyd in finding his birds after he had shot them My connection with Master Daniel was of some advantage to me He became quite attached to me and was a sort of protector of me He would not allow the older boys to impose upon me and would divide his cakes with me I was seldom whipped by my old master and suffered little from any thing else than hunger and cold I suffered much from hunger but much more from cold In hottest summer and coldest winter I was kept almost naked--no shoes no stockings no jacket no trousers nothing on but a coarse tow linen shirt reaching only to my knees I had no bed I must have perished with cold but that the coldest nights I used to steal a bag which was used for carrying corn to the mill I would crawl into this bag and there sleep on the cold damp clay floor with my head in and feet out My feet have been so cracked with the frost that the pen with which I am writing might be laid in the gashes We were not regularly allowanced Our food was coarse corn meal boiled This was called mush It was put into a large wooden tray or trough and set down upon the ground The children were then called like so many pigs and like so many pigs they would come and devour the mush some with oyster-shells others with pieces of shingle some with naked hands and none with spoons He that ate fastest got most he that was strongest secured the best place and few left the trough satisfied I was probably between seven and eight years old when I left Colonel Lloyd's plantation I left it with joy I shall never forget the ecstasy with which I received the intelligence that my old master Anthony had determined to let me go to Baltimore to live with Mr Hugh Auld brother to my old master's son-in-law Captain Thomas Auld I received this information about three days before my departure They were three of the happiest days I ever enjoyed I spent the most part of all these three days in the creek washing off the plantation scurf and preparing myself for my departure The pride of appearance which this would indicate was not my own I spent the time in washing not so much because I wished to but because Mrs Lucretia had told me I must get all the dead skin off my feet and knees before I could go to Baltimore for the people in Baltimore were very cleanly and would laugh at me if I looked dirty Besides she was going to give me a pair or trousers which I should not put on unless I got all the dirt off me The thought of owning a pair of trousers was great indeed It was almost a sufficient motive not only to make me take off what would be called by pig-drovers the mange but the skin itself I went at it in good earnest working for the first time with the hope of reward The ties that ordinarily bind children to their homes were all suspended in my case I found no severe trial in my departure My home was charmless it was not home to me on parting from it I could not feel that I was leaving any thing which I could have enjoyed by staying My mother was dead my grandmother lived far off so that I seldom saw her I had two sisters and one brother that lived in the same house with me but the early separation of us from our mother had well nigh blotted the fact of our relationship from our memories I looked for home elsewhere and was confident of finding none which I should relish less than the one which I was leaving If however I found in my new home hardship hunger whipping and nakedness I had the consolation that I should not have escaped any one of them by staying Having already had more than a taste of them in the house of my old master and having endured them there I very naturally inferred my ability to endure them elsewhere and especially at Baltimore for I had something of the feeling about Baltimore that is expressed in the proverb that being hanged in England is preferable to dying a natural death in Ireland I had the strongest desire to see Baltimore Cousin Tom though not fluent in speech had inspired me with that desire by his eloquent description of the place I could never point out any thing at the Great House no matter how beautiful or powerful but that he had seen something at Baltimore far exceeding both in beauty and strength the object which I pointed out to him Even the Great House itself with all its pictures was far inferior to many buildings in Baltimore So strong was my desire that I thought a gratification of it would fully compensate for whatever loss of comforts I should sustain by the exchange I left without a regret and with the highest hopes of future happiness We sailed out of Miles River for Baltimore on a Saturday morning I remember only the day of the week for at that time I had no knowledge of the days of the month nor the months of the year On setting sail I walked aft and gave to Colonel Lloyd's plantation what I hoped would be the last look I then placed myself in the bows of the sloop and there spent the remainder of the day in looking ahead interesting myself in what was in the distance rather than in things nearby or behind In the afternoon of that day we reached Annapolis the capital of the State We stopped but a few moments so that I had no time to go on shore It was the first large town that I had ever seen and though it would look small compared with some of our New England factory villages I thought it a wonderful place for its size--more imposing even than the Great House Farm We arrived at Baltimore early on Sunday morning landing at Smith's Wharf not far from Bowley's Wharf We had on board the sloop a large flock of sheep and after aiding in driving them to the slaughterhouse of Mr Curtis on Louden Slater's Hill I was conducted by Rich one of the hands belonging on board of the sloop to my new home in Alliciana Street near Mr Gardner's ship-yard on Fells Point Mr and Mrs Auld were both at home and met me at the door with their little son Thomas to take care of whom I had been given And here I saw what I had never seen before it was a white face beaming with the most kindly emotions it was the face of my new mistress Sophia Auld I wish I could describe the rapture that flashed through my soul as I beheld it It was a new and strange sight to me brightening up my pathway with the light of happiness Little Thomas was told there was his Freddy--and I was told to take care of little Thomas and thus I entered upon the duties of my new home with the most cheering prospect ahead I look upon my departure from Colonel Lloyd's plantation as one of the most interesting events of my life It is possible and even quite probable that but for the mere circumstance of being removed from that plantation to Baltimore I should have to-day instead of being here seated by my own table in the enjoyment of freedom and the happiness of home writing this Narrative been confined in the galling chains of slavery Going to live at Baltimore laid the foundation and opened the gateway to all my subsequent prosperity I have ever regarded it as the first plain manifestation of that kind providence which has ever since attended me and marked my life with so many favors I regarded the selection of myself as being somewhat remarkable There were a number of slave children that might have been sent from the plantation to Baltimore There were those younger those older and those of the same age I was chosen from among them all and was the first last and only choice I may be deemed superstitions and even egotistical in regarding this event as a special interposition of divine Providence in my favor But I should be false to the earliest sentiments of my soul if I suppressed the opinion I prefer to be true to myself even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others rather than to be false and incur my own abhorrence From my earliest recollection I date the entertainment of a deep conviction that slavery would not always be able to hold me within its foul embrace and in the darkest hours of my career in slavery this living word of faith and spirit of hope departed not from me but remained like ministering angels to cheer me through the gloom This good spirit was from God and to him I offer thanksgiving and praise VI My new mistress proved to be all she appeared when I first met her at the door--a woman of the kindest heart and finest feelings She had never had a slave under her control previously to myself and prior to her marriage she had been dependent upon her own industry for a living She was by trade a weaver and by constant application to her business she had been in a good degree preserved from the blighting and dehumanizing effects of slavery I was utterly astonished at her goodness I scarcely knew how to behave towards her She was entirely unlike any other white woman I had ever seen I could not approach her as I was accustomed to approach other white ladies My early instruction was all out of place The crouching servility usually so acceptable a quality in a slave did not answer when manifested toward her Her favor was not gained by it she seemed to be disturbed by it She did not deem it impudent or unmannerly for a slave to look her in the face The meanest slave was put fully at ease in her presence and none left without feeling better for having seen her Her face was made of heavenly smiles and her voice of tranquil music But alas this kind heart had but a short time to remain such The fatal poison of irresponsible power was already in her hands and soon commenced its infernal work That cheerful eye under the influence of slavery soon became red with rage that voice made all of sweet accord changed to one of harsh and horrid discord and that angelic face gave place to that of a demon Very soon after I went to live with Mr and Mrs Auld she very kindly commenced to teach me the A B C After I had learned this she assisted me in learning to spell words of three or four letters Just at this point of my progress Mr Auld found out what was going on and at once forbade Mrs Auld to instruct me further telling her among other things that it was unlawful as well as unsafe to teach a slave to read To use his own words further he said If you give a nigger an inch he will take an ell A nigger should know nothing but to obey his master--to do as he is told to do Learning would spoil the best nigger in the world Now said he if you teach that nigger speaking of myself how to read there would be no keeping him It would forever unfit him to be a slave He would at once become unmanageable and of no value to his master As to himself it could do him no good but a great deal of harm It would make him discontented and unhappy These words sank deep into my heart stirred up sentiments within that lay slumbering and called into existence an entirely new train of thought It was a new and special revelation explaining dark and mysterious things with which my youthful understanding had struggled but struggled in vain I now understood what had been to me a most perplexing difficulty--to wit the white man's power to enslave the black man It was a grand achievement and I prized it highly From that moment I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom It was just what I wanted and I got it at a time when I the least expected it Whilst I was saddened by the thought of losing the aid of my kind mistress I was gladdened by the invaluable instruction which by the merest accident I had gained from my master Though conscious of the difficulty of learning without a teacher I set out with high hope and a fixed purpose at whatever cost of trouble to learn how to read The very decided manner with which he spoke and strove to impress his wife with the evil consequences of giving me instruction served to convince me that he was deeply sensible of the truths he was uttering It gave me the best assurance that I might rely with the utmost confidence on the results which he said would flow from teaching me to read What he most dreaded that I most desired What he most loved that I most hated That which to him was a great evil to be carefully shunned was to me a great good to be diligently sought and the argument which he so warmly urged against my learning to read only served to inspire me with a desire and determination to learn In learning to read I owe almost as much to the bitter opposition of my master as to the kindly aid of my mistress I acknowledge the benefit of both I had resided but a short time in Baltimore before I observed a marked difference in the treatment of slaves from that which I had witnessed in the country A city slave is almost a freeman compared with a slave on the plantation He is much better fed and clothed and enjoys privileges altogether unknown to the slave on the plantation There is a vestige of decency a sense of shame that does much to curb and check those outbreaks of atrocious cruelty so commonly enacted upon the plantation He is a desperate slaveholder who will shock the humanity of his non-slaveholding neighbors with the cries of his lacerated slave Few are willing to incur the odium attaching to the reputation of being a cruel master and above all things they would not be known as not giving a slave enough to eat Every city slaveholder is anxious to have it known of him that he feeds his slaves well and it is due to them to say that most of them do give their slaves enough to eat There are however some painful exceptions to this rule Directly opposite to us on Philpot Street lived Mr Thomas Hamilton He owned two slaves Their names were Henrietta and Mary Henrietta was about twenty-two years of age Mary was about fourteen and of all the mangled and emaciated creatures I ever looked upon these two were the most so His heart must be harder than stone that could look upon these unmoved The head neck and shoulders of Mary were literally cut to pieces I have frequently felt her head and found it nearly covered with festering sores caused by the lash of her cruel mistress I do not know that her master ever whipped her but I have been an eye-witness to the cruelty of Mrs Hamilton I used to be in Mr Hamilton's house nearly every day Mrs Hamilton used to sit in a large chair in the middle of the room with a heavy cowskin always by her side and scarce an hour passed during the day but was marked by the blood of one of these slaves The girls seldom passed her without her saying Move faster you black gip at the same time giving them a blow with the cowskin over the head or shoulders often drawing the blood She would then say Take that you black gip-- continuing If you don't move faster I'll move you Added to the cruel lashings to which these slaves were subjected they were kept nearly half-starved They seldom knew what it was to eat a full meal I have seen Mary contending with the pigs for the offal thrown into the street So much was Mary kicked and cut to pieces that she was oftener called pecked than by her name VII I LIVED in Master Hugh's family about seven years During this time I succeeded in learning to read and write In accomplishing this I was compelled to resort to various stratagems I had no regular teacher My mistress who had kindly commenced to instruct me had in compliance with the advice and direction of her husband not only ceased to instruct but had set her face against my being instructed by any one else It is due however to my mistress to say of her that she did not adopt this course of treatment immediately She at first lacked the depravity indispensable to shutting me up in mental darkness It was at least necessary for her to have some training in the exercise of irresponsible power to make her equal to the task of treating me as though I were a brute My mistress was as I have said a kind and tender-hearted woman and in the simplicity of her soul she commenced when I first went to live with her to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another In entering upon the duties of a slaveholder she did not seem to perceive that I sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel and that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong but dangerously so Slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me When I went there she was a pious warm and tender-hearted woman There was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear She had bread for the hungry clothes for the naked and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach Slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities Under its influence the tender heart became stone and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of tiger-like fierceness The first step in her downward course was in her ceasing to instruct me She now commenced to practise her husband's precepts She finally became even more violent in her opposition than her husband himself She was not satisfied with simply doing as well as he had commanded she seemed anxious to do better Nothing seemed to make her more angry than to see me with a newspaper She seemed to think that here lay the danger I have had her rush at me with a face made all up of fury and snatch from me a newspaper in a manner that fully revealed her apprehension She was an apt woman and a little experience soon demonstrated to her satisfaction that education and slavery were incompatible with each other From this time I was most narrowly watched If I was in a separate room any considerable length of time I was sure to be suspected of having a book and was at once called to give an account of myself All this however was too late The first step had been taken Mistress in teaching me the alphabet had given me the inch and no precaution could prevent me from taking the ell The plan which I adopted and the one by which I was most successful was that of making friends of all the little white boys whom I met in the street As many of these as I could I converted into teachers With their kindly aid obtained at different times and in different places I finally succeeded in learning to read When I was sent of errands I always took my book with me and by going one part of my errand quickly I found time to get a lesson before my return I used also to carry bread with me enough of which was always in the house and to which I was always welcome for I was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood This bread I used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins who in return would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them but prudence forbids--not that it would injure me but it might embarrass them for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this Christian country It is enough to say of the dear little fellows that they lived on Philpot Street very near Durgin and Bailey's ship-yard I used to talk this matter of slavery over with them I would sometimes say to them I wished I could be as free as they would be when they got to be men You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one but I am a slave for life Have not I as good a right to be free as you have These words used to trouble them they would express for me the liveliest sympathy and console me with the hope that something would occur by which I might be free I was now about twelve years old and the thought of being a slave for life began to bear heavily upon my heart Just about this time I got hold of a book entitled The Columbian Orator Every opportunity I got I used to read this book Among much of other interesting matter I found in it a dialogue between a master and his slave The slave was represented as having run away from his master three times The dialogue represented the conversation which took place between them when the slave was retaken the third time In this dialogue the whole argument in behalf of slavery was brought forward by the master all of which was disposed of by the slave The slave was made to say some very smart as well as impressive things in reply to his master--things which had the desired though unexpected effect for the conversation resulted in the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part of the master In the same book I met with one of Sheridan's mighty speeches on and in behalf of Catholic emancipation These were choice documents to me I read them over and over again with unabated interest They gave tongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul which had frequently flashed through my mind and died away for want of utterance The moral which I gained from the dialogue was the power of truth over the conscience of even a slaveholder What I got from Sheridan was a bold denunciation of slavery and a powerful vindication of human rights The reading of these documents enabled me to utter my thoughts and to meet the arguments brought forward to sustain slavery but while they relieved me of one difficulty they brought on another even more painful than the one of which I was relieved The more I read the more I was led to abhor and detest my enslavers I could regard them in no other light than a band of successful robbers who had left their homes and gone to Africa and stolen us from our homes and in a strange land reduced us to slavery I loathed them as being the meanest as well as the most wicked of men As I read and contemplated the subject behold that very discontentment which Master Hugh had predicted would follow my learning to read had already come to torment and sting my soul to unutterable anguish As I writhed under it I would at times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than a blessing It had given me a view of my wretched condition without the remedy It opened my eyes to the horrible pit but to no ladder upon which to get out In moments of agony I envied my fellow-slaves for their stupidity I have often wished myself a beast I preferred the condition of the meanest reptile to my own Any thing no matter what to get rid of thinking It was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me There was no getting rid of it It was pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing animate or inanimate The silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal wakefulness Freedom now appeared to disappear no more forever It was heard in every sound and seen in every thing It was ever present to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition I saw nothing without seeing it I heard nothing without hearing it and felt nothing without feeling it It looked from every star it smiled in every calm breathed in every wind and moved in every storm I often found myself regretting my own existence and wishing myself dead and but for the hope of being free I have no doubt but that I should have killed myself or done something for which I should have been killed While in this state of mind I was eager to hear any one speak of slavery I was a ready listener Every little while I could hear something about the abolitionists It was some time before I found what the word meant It was always used in such connections as to make it an interesting word to me If a slave ran away and succeeded in getting clear or if a slave killed his master set fire to a barn or did any thing very wrong in the mind of a slaveholder it was spoken of as the fruit of abolition Hearing the word in this connection very often I set about learning what it meant The dictionary afforded me little or no help I found it was the act of abolishing but then I did not know what was to be abolished Here I was perplexed I did not dare to ask any one about its meaning for I was satisfied that it was something they wanted me to know very little about After a patient waiting I got one of our city papers containing an account of the number of petitions from the north praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia and of the slave trade between the States From this time I understood the words abolition and abolitionist and always drew near when that word was spoken expecting to bear something of importance to myself and fellow-slaves The light broke in upon me by degrees I went one day down on the wharf of Mr Waters and seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow of stone I went unasked and helped them When we had finished one of them came to me and asked me if I were a slave I told him I was He asked Are ye a slave for life I told him that I was The good Irishman seemed to be deeply affected by the statement He said to the other that it was a pity so fine a little fellow as myself should be a slave for life He said it was a shame to hold me They both advised me to run away to the north that I should find friends there and that I should be free I pretended not to be interested in what they said and treated them as if I did not understand them for I feared they might be treacherous White men have been known to encourage slaves to escape and then to get the reward catch them and return them to their masters I was afraid that these seemingly good men might use me so but I nevertheless remembered their advice and from that time I resolved to run away I looked forward to a time at which it would be safe for me to escape I was too young to think of doing so immediately besides I wished to learn how to write as I might have occasion to write my own pass I consoled myself with the hope that I should one day find a good chance Meanwhile I would learn to write The idea as to how I might learn to write was suggested to me by being in Durgin and Bailey's ship-yard and frequently seeing the ship carpenters after hewing and getting a piece of timber ready for use write on the timber the name of that part of the ship for which it was intended When a piece of timber was intended for the larboard side it would be marked thus--L When a piece was for the starboard side it would be marked thus-- S A piece for the larboard side forward would be marked thus--L F When a piece was for starboard side forward it would be marked thus--S F For larboard aft it would be marked thus--L A For starboard aft it would be marked thus--S A I soon learned the names of these letters and for what they were intended when placed upon a piece of timber in the ship-yard I immediately commenced copying them and in a short time was able to make the four letters named After that when I met with any boy who I knew could write I would tell him I could write as well as he The next word would be I don't believe you Let me see you try it I would then make the letters which I had been so fortunate as to learn and ask him to beat that In this way I got a good many lessons in writing which it is quite possible I should never have gotten in any other way During this time my copy-book was the board fence brick wall and pavement my pen and ink was a lump of chalk With these I learned mainly how to write I then commenced and continued copying the Italics in Webster's Spelling Book until I could make them all without looking on the book By this time my little Master Thomas had gone to school and learned how to write and had written over a number of copy-books These had been brought home and shown to some of our near neighbors and then laid aside My mistress used to go to class meeting at the Wilk Street meeting house every Monday afternoon and leave me to take care of the house When left thus I used to spend the time in writing in the spaces left in Master Thomas's copy-book copying what he had written I continued to do this until I could write a hand very similar to that of Master Thomas Thus after a long tedious effort for years I finally succeeded in learning how to write VIII IN a very short time after I went to live at Baltimore my old master's youngest son Richard died and in about three years and six months after his death my old master Captain Anthony died leaving only his son Andrew and daughter Lucretia to share his estate He died while on a visit to see his daughter at Hillsborough Cut off thus unexpectedly he left no will as to the disposal of his property It was therefore necessary to have a valuation of the property that it might be equally divided between Mrs Lucretia and Master Andrew I was immediately sent for to be valued with the other property Here again my feelings rose up in detestation of slavery I had now a new conception of my degraded condition Prior to this I had become if not insensible to my lot at least partly so I left Baltimore with a young heart overborne with sadness and a soul full of apprehension I took passage with Captain Rowe in the schooner Wild Cat and after a sail of about twenty-four hours I found myself near the place of my birth I had now been absent from it almost if not quite five years I however remembered the place very well I was only about five years old when I left it to go and live with my old master on Colonel Lloyd's plantation so that I was now between ten and eleven years old We were all ranked together at the valuation Men and women old and young married and single were ranked with horses sheep and swine There were horses and men cattle and women pigs and children all holding the same rank in the scale of being and were all subjected to the same narrow examination Silvery-headed age and sprightly youth maids and matrons had to undergo the same indelicate inspection At this moment I saw more clearly than ever the brutalizing effects of slavery upon both slave and slaveholder After the valuation then came the division I have no language to express the high excitement and deep anxiety which were felt among us poor slaves during this time Our fate for life was now to be decided We had no more voice in that decision than the brutes among whom we were ranked A single word from the white men was enough--against all our wishes prayers and entreaties--to sunder forever the dearest friends dearest kindred and strongest ties known to human beings In addition to the pain of separation there was the horrid dread of falling into the hands of Master Andrew He was known to us all as being a most cruel wretch--a common drunkard who had by his reckless mismanagement and profligate dissipation already wasted a large portion of his father's property We all felt that we might as well be sold at once to the Georgia traders as to pass into his hands for we knew that that would be our inevitable condition--a condition held by us all in the utmost horror and dread I suffered more anxiety than most of my fellow-slaves I had known what it was to be kindly treated they had known nothing of the kind They had seen little or nothing of the world They were in very deed men and women of sorrow and acquainted with grief Their backs had been made familiar with the bloody lash so that they had become callous mine was yet tender for while at Baltimore I got few whippings and few slaves could boast of a kinder master and mistress than myself and the thought of passing out of their hands into those of Master Andrew--a man who but a few days before to give me a sample of his bloody disposition took my little brother by the throat threw him on the ground and with the heel of his boot stamped upon his head till the blood gushed from his nose and ears--was well calculated to make me anxious as to my fate After he had committed this savage outrage upon my brother he turned to me and said that was the way he meant to serve me one of these days--meaning I suppose when I came into his possession Thanks to a kind Providence I fell to the portion of Mrs Lucretia and was sent immediately back to Baltimore to live again in the family of Master Hugh Their joy at my return equalled their sorrow at my departure It was a glad day to me I had escaped a worse than lion's jaws I was absent from Baltimore for the purpose of valuation and division just about one month and it seemed to have been six Very soon after my return to Baltimore my mistress Lucretia died leaving her husband and one child Amanda and in a very short time after her death Master Andrew died Now all the property of my old master slaves included was in the hands of strangers --strangers who had had nothing to do with accumulating it Not a slave was left free All remained slaves from the youngest to the oldest If any one thing in my experience more than another served to deepen my conviction of the infernal character of slavery and to fill me with unutterable loathing of slaveholders it was their base ingratitude to my poor old grandmother She had served my old master faithfully from youth to old age She had been the source of all his wealth she had peopled his plantation with slaves she had become a great grandmother in his service She had rocked him in infancy attended him in childhood served him through life and at his death wiped from his icy brow the cold death-sweat and closed his eyes forever She was nevertheless left a slave--a slave for life--a slave in the hands of strangers and in their hands she saw her children her grandchildren and her great-grand children divided like so many sheep without being gratified with the small privilege of a single word as to their or her own destiny And to cap the climax of their base ingratitude and fiendish barbarity my grandmother who was now very old having outlived my old master and all his children having seen the beginning and end of all of them and her present owners finding she was of but little value her frame already racked with the pains of old age and complete helplessness fast stealing over her once active limbs they took her to the woods built her a little hut put up a little mud-chimney and then made her welcome to the privilege of supporting herself there in perfect loneliness thus virtually turning her out to die If my poor old grandmother now lives she lives to suffer in utter loneliness she lives to remember and mourn over the loss of children the loss of grandchildren and the loss of great-grandchildren They are in the language of the slave's poet Whittier-- Gone gone sold and gone To the rice swamp dank and lone Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings Where the noisome insect stings Where the fever-demon strews Poison with the failing dews Where the sickly sunbeams glare Through the hot and misty air-- Gone gone sold and gone To the rice swamp dank and lone From Virginia hills and waters-- Woe is me my stolen daughters The hearth is desolate The children the unconscious children who once sang and danced in her presence are gone She gropes her way in the darkness of age for a drink of water Instead of the voices of her children she hears by day the moans of the dove and by night the screams of the hideous owl All is gloom The grave is at the door And now when weighed down by the pains and aches of old age when the head inclines to the feet when the beginning and ending of human existence meet and helpless infancy and painful old age combine together--at this time this most needful time the time for the exercise of that tenderness and affection which children only can exercise towards a declining parent-- my poor old grandmother the devoted mother of twelve children is left all alone in yonder little hut before a few dim embers She stands--she sits--she staggers-- she falls--she groans--she dies--and there are none of her children or grandchildren present to wipe from her wrinkled brow the cold sweat of death or to place beneath the sod her fallen remains Will not a righteous God visit for these things In about two years after the death of Mrs Lucretia Master Thomas married his second wife Her name was Rowena Hamilton She was the eldest daughter of Mr William Hamilton Master now lived in St Michael's Not long after his marriage a misunderstanding took place between himself and Master Hugh and as a means of punishing his brother he took me from him to live with himself at St Michael's Here I underwent another most painful separation It however was not so severe as the one I dreaded at the division of property for during this interval a great change had taken place in Master Hugh and his once kind and affectionate wife The influence of brandy upon him and of slavery upon her had effected a disastrous change in the characters of both so that as far as they were concerned I thought I had little to lose by the change But it was not to them that I was attached It was to those little Baltimore boys that I felt the strongest attachment I had received many good lessons from them and was still receiving them and the thought of leaving them was painful indeed I was leaving too without the hope of ever being allowed to return Master Thomas had said he would never let me return again The barrier betwixt himself and brother he considered impassable I then had to regret that I did not at least make the attempt to carry out my resolution to run away for the chances of success are tenfold greater from the city than from the country I sailed from Baltimore for St Michael's in the sloop Amanda Captain Edward Dodson On my passage I paid particular attention to the direction which the steamboats took to go to Philadelphia I found instead of going down on reaching North Point they went up the bay in a north-easterly direction I deemed this knowledge of the utmost importance My determination to run away was again revived I resolved to wait only so long as the offering of a favorable opportunity When that came I was determined to be off IX I HAVE now reached a period of my life when I can give dates I left Baltimore and went to live with Master Thomas Auld at St Michael's in March It was now more than seven years since I lived with him in the family of my old master on Colonel Lloyd's plantation We of course were now almost entire strangers to each other He was to me a new master and I to him a new slave I was ignorant of his temper and disposition he was equally so of mine A very short time however brought us into full acquaintance with each other I was made acquainted with his wife not less than with himself They were well matched being equally mean and cruel I was now for the first time during a space of more than seven years made to feel the painful gnawings of hunger-- a something which I had not experienced before since I left Colonel Lloyd's plantation It went hard enough with me then when I could look back to no period at which I had enjoyed a sufficiency It was tenfold harder after living in Master Hugh's family where I had always had enough to eat and of that which was good I have said Master Thomas was a mean man He was so Not to give a slave enough to eat is regarded as the most aggravated development of meanness even among slaveholders The rule is no matter how coarse the food only let there be enough of it This is the theory and in the part of Maryland from which I came it is the general practice--though there are many exceptions Master Thomas gave us enough of neither coarse nor fine food There were four slaves of us in the kitchen--my sister Eliza my aunt Priscilla Henny and myself and we were allowed less than a half of a bushel of corn-meal per week and very little else either in the shape of meat or vegetables It was not enough for us to subsist upon We were therefore reduced to the wretched necessity of living at the expense of our neighbors This we did by begging and stealing whichever came handy in the time of need the one being considered as legitimate as the other A great many times have we poor creatures been nearly perishing with hunger when food in abundance lay mouldering in the safe and smoke-house and our pious mistress was aware of the fact and yet that mistress and her husband would kneel every morning and pray that God would bless them in basket and store Bad as all slaveholders are we seldom meet one destitute of every element of character commanding respect My master was one of this rare sort I do not know of one single noble act ever performed by him The leading trait in his character was meanness and if there were any other element in his nature it was made subject to this He was mean and like most other mean men he lacked the ability to conceal his meanness Captain Auld was not born a slaveholder He had been a poor man master only of a Bay craft He came into possession of all his slaves by marriage and of all men adopted slaveholders are the worst He was cruel but cowardly He commanded without firmness In the enforcement of his rules he was at times rigid and at times lax At times he spoke to his slaves with the firmness of Napoleon and the fury of a demon at other times he might well be mistaken for an inquirer who had lost his way He did nothing of himself He might have passed for a lion but for his ears In all things noble which he attempted his own meanness shone most conspicuous His airs words and actions were the airs words and actions of born slaveholders and being assumed were awkward enough He was not even a good imitator He possessed all the disposition to deceive but wanted the power Having no resources within himself he was compelled to be the copyist of many and being such he was forever the victim of inconsistency and of consequence he was an object of contempt and was held as such even by his slaves The luxury of having slaves of his own to wait upon him was something new and unprepared for He was a slaveholder without the ability to hold slaves He found himself incapable of managing his slaves either by force fear or fraud We seldom called him master we generally called him Captain Auld and were hardly disposed to title him at all I doubt not that our conduct had much to do with making him appear awkward and of consequence fretful Our want of reverence for him must have perplexed him greatly He wished to have us call him master but lacked the firmness necessary to command us to do so His wife used to insist upon our calling him so but to no purpose In August my master attended a Methodist camp-meeting held in the Bay-side Talbot county and there experienced religion I indulged a faint hope that his conversion would lead him to emancipate his slaves and that if he did not do this it would at any rate make him more kind and humane I was disappointed in both these respects It neither made him to be humane to his slaves nor to emancipate them If it had any effect on his character it made him more cruel and hateful in all his ways for I believe him to have been a much worse man after his conversion than before Prior to his conversion he relied upon his own depravity to shield and sustain him in his savage barbarity but after his conversion he found religious sanction and support for his slaveholding cruelty He made the greatest pretensions to piety His house was the house of prayer He prayed morning noon and night He very soon distinguished himself among his brethren and was soon made a class-leader and exhorter His activity in revivals was great and he proved himself an instrument in the hands of the church in converting many souls His house was the preachers' home They used to take great pleasure in coming there to put up for while he starved us he stuffed them We have had three or four preachers there at a time The names of those who used to come most frequently while I lived there were Mr Storks Mr Ewery Mr Humphry and Mr Hickey I have also seen Mr George Cookman at our house We slaves loved Mr Cookman We believed him to be a good man We thought him instrumental in getting Mr Samuel Harrison a very rich slaveholder to emancipate his slaves and by some means got the impression that he was laboring to effect the emancipation of all the slaves When he was at our house we were sure to be called in to prayers When the others were there we were sometimes called in and sometimes not Mr Cookman took more notice of us than either of the other ministers He could not come among us without betraying his sympathy for us and stupid as we were we had the sagacity to see it While I lived with my master in St Michael's there was a white young man a Mr Wilson who proposed to keep a Sabbath school for the instruction of such slaves as might be disposed to learn to read the New Testament We met but three times when Mr West and Mr Fairbanks both class-leaders with many others came upon us with sticks and other missiles drove us off and forbade us to meet again Thus ended our little Sabbath school in the pious town of St Michael's I have said my master found religious sanction for his cruelty As an example I will state one of many facts going to prove the charge I have seen him tie up a lame young woman and whip her with a heavy cowskin upon her naked shoulders causing the warm red blood to drip and in justification of the bloody deed he would quote this passage of Scripture--He that knoweth his master's will and doeth it not shall be beaten with many stripes Master would keep this lacerated young woman tied up in this horrid situation four or five hours at a time I have known him to tie her up early in the morning and whip her before breakfast leave her go to his store return at dinner and whip her again cutting her in the places already made raw with his cruel lash The secret of master's cruelty toward Henny is found in the fact of her being almost helpless When quite a child she fell into the fire and burned herself horribly Her hands were so burnt that she never got the use of them She could do very little but bear heavy burdens She was to master a bill of expense and as he was a mean man she was a constant offence to him He seemed desirous of getting the poor girl out of existence He gave her away once to his sister but being a poor gift she was not disposed to keep her Finally my benevolent master to use his own words set her adrift to take care of herself Here was a recently-converted man holding on upon the mother and at the same time turning out her helpless child to starve and die Master Thomas was one of the many pious slaveholders who hold slaves for the very charitable purpose of taking care of them My master and myself had quite a number of differences He found me unsuitable to his purpose My city life he said had had a very pernicious effect upon me It had almost ruined me for every good purpose and fitted me for every thing which was bad One of my greatest faults was that of letting his horse run away and go down to his father-in-law's farm which was about five miles from St Michael's I would then have to go after it My reason for this kind of carelessness or carefulness was that I could always get something to eat when I went there Master William Hamilton my master's father-in-law always gave his slaves enough to eat I never left there hungry no matter how great the need of my speedy return Master Thomas at length said he would stand it no longer I had lived with him nine months during which time he had given me a number of severe whippings all to no good purpose He resolved to put me out as he said to be broken and for this purpose he let me for one year to a man named Edward Covey Mr Covey was a poor man a farm-renter He rented the place upon which he lived as also the hands with which he tilled it Mr Covey had acquired a very high reputation for breaking young slaves and this reputation was of immense value to him It enabled him to get his farm tilled with much less expense to himself than he could have had it done without such a reputation Some slaveholders thought it not much loss to allow Mr Covey to have their slaves one year for the sake of the training to which they were subjected without any other compensation He could hire young help with great ease in consequence of this reputation Added to the natural good qualities of Mr Covey he was a professor of religion--a pious soul--a member and a class-leader in the Methodist church All of this added weight to his reputation as a nigger-breaker I was aware of all the facts having been made acquainted with them by a young man who had lived there I nevertheless made the change gladly for I was sure of getting enough to eat which is not the smallest consideration to a hungry man X I LEFT Master Thomas's house and went to live with Mr Covey on the st of January I was now for the first time in my life a field hand In my new employment I found myself even more awkward than a country boy appeared to be in a large city I had been at my new home but one week before Mr Covey gave me a very severe whipping cutting my back causing the blood to run and raising ridges on my flesh as large as my little finger The details of this affair are as follows Mr Covey sent me very early in the morning of one of our coldest days in the month of January to the woods to get a load of wood He gave me a team of unbroken oxen He told me which was the in-hand ox and which the off-hand one He then tied the end of a large rope around the horns of the in-hand ox and gave me the other end of it and told me if the oxen started to run that I must hold on upon the rope I had never driven oxen before and of course I was very awkward I however succeeded in getting to the edge of the woods with little difficulty but I had got a very few rods into the woods when the oxen took fright and started full tilt carrying the cart against trees and over stumps in the most frightful manner I expected every moment that my brains would be dashed out against the trees After running thus for a considerable distance they finally upset the cart dashing it with great force against a tree and threw themselves into it dense thicket How I escaped death I do not know There I was entirely alone in a thick wood in a place new to me My cart was upset and shattered my oxen were entangled among the young trees and there was none to help me After a long spell of effort I succeeded in getting my cart righted my oxen disentangled and again yoked to the cart I now proceeded with my team to the place where I had the day before been chopping wood and loaded my cart pretty heavily thinking in this way to tame my oxen I then proceeded on my way home I had now consumed one half of the day I got out of the woods safely and now felt out of danger I stopped my oxen to open the woods gate and just as I did so before I could get hold of my ox-rope the oxen again started rushed through the gate catching it between the wheel and the body of the cart tearing it to pieces and coming within a few inches of crushing me against the gate-post Thus twice in one short day I escaped death by the merest chance On my return I told Mr Covey what had happened and how it happened He ordered me to return to the woods again immediately I did so and he followed on after me Just as I got into the woods he came up and told me to stop my cart and that he would teach me how to trifle away my time and break gates He then went to a large gum-tree and with his axe cut three large switches and after trimming them up neatly with his pocket-knife he ordered me to take off my clothes I made him no answer but stood with my clothes on He repeated his order I still made him no answer nor did I move to strip myself Upon this he rushed at me with the fierceness of a tiger tore off my clothes and lashed me till he had worn out his switches cutting me so savagely as to leave the marks visible for a long time after This whipping was the first of a number just like it and for similar offences I lived with Mr Covey one year During the first six months of that year scarce a week passed without his whipping me I was seldom free from a sore back My awkwardness was almost always his excuse for whipping me We were worked fully up to the point of endurance Long before day we were up our horses fed and by the first approach of day we were off to the field with our hoes and ploughing teams Mr Covey gave us enough to eat but scarce time to eat it We were often less than five minutes taking our meals We were often in the field from the first approach of day till its last lingering ray had left us and at saving-fodder time midnight often caught us in the field binding blades Covey would be out with us The way he used to stand it was this He would spend the most of his afternoons in bed He would then come out fresh in the evening ready to urge us on with his words example and frequently with the whip Mr Covey was one of the few slaveholders who could and did work with his hands He was a hard-working man He knew by himself just what a man or a boy could do There was no deceiving him His work went on in his absence almost as well as in his presence and he had the faculty of making us feel that he was ever present with us This he did by surprising us He seldom approached the spot where we were at work openly if he could do it secretly He always aimed at taking us by surprise Such was his cunning that we used to call him among ourselves the snake When we were at work in the cornfield he would sometimes crawl on his hands and knees to avoid detection and all at once he would rise nearly in our midst and scream out Ha ha Come come Dash on dash on This being his mode of attack it was never safe to stop a single minute His comings were like a thief in the night He appeared to us as being ever at hand He was under every tree behind every stump in every bush and at every window on the plantation He would sometimes mount his horse as if bound to St Michael's a distance of seven miles and in half an hour afterwards you would see him coiled up in the corner of the wood-fence watching every motion of the slaves He would for this purpose leave his horse tied up in the woods Again he would sometimes walk up to us and give us orders as though he was upon the point of starting on a long journey turn his back upon us and make as though he was going to the house to get ready and before he would get half way thither he would turn short and crawl into a fence-corner or behind some tree and there watch us till the going down of the sun Mr Covey's forte consisted in his power to deceive His life was devoted to planning and perpetrating the grossest deceptions Every thing he possessed in the shape of learning or religion he made conform to his disposition to deceive He seemed to think himself equal to deceiving the Almighty He would make a short prayer in the morning and a long prayer at night and strange as it may seem few men would at times appear more devotional than he The exercises of his family devotions were always commenced with singing and as he was a very poor singer himself the duty of raising the hymn generally came upon me He would read his hymn and nod at me to commence I would at times do so at others I would not My non-compliance would almost always produce much confusion To show himself independent of me he would start and stagger through with his hymn in the most discordant manner In this state of mind he prayed with more than ordinary spirit Poor man Such was his disposition and success at deceiving I do verily believe that he sometimes deceived himself into the solemn belief that he was a sincere worshipper of the most high God and this too at a time when he may be said to have been guilty of compelling his woman slave to commit the sin of adultery The facts in the case are these Mr Covey was a poor man he was just commencing in life he was only able to buy one slave and shocking as is the fact he bought her as he said for a breeder This woman was named Caroline Mr Covey bought her from Mr Thomas Lowe about six miles from St Michael's She was a large able-bodied woman about twenty years old She had already given birth to one child which proved her to be just what he wanted After buying her he hired a married man of Mr Samuel Harrison to live with him one year and him he used to fasten up with her every night The result was that at the end of the year the miserable woman gave birth to twins At this result Mr Covey seemed to be highly pleased both with the man and the wretched woman Such was his joy and that of his wife that nothing they could do for Caroline during her confinement was too good or too hard to be done The children were regarded as being quite an addition to his wealth If at any one time of my life more than another I was made to drink the bitterest dregs of slavery that time was during the first six months of my stay with Mr Covey We were worked in all weathers It was never too hot or too cold it could never rain blow hail or snow too hard for us to work in the field Work work work was scarcely more the order of the day than of the night The longest days were too short for him and the shortest nights too long for him I was somewhat unmanageable when I first went there but a few months of this discipline tamed me Mr Covey succeeded in breaking me I was broken in body soul and spirit My natural elasticity was crushed my intellect languished the disposition to read departed the cheerful spark that lingered about my eye died the dark night of slavery closed in upon me and behold a man transformed into a brute Sunday was my only leisure time I spent this in a sort of beast-like stupor between sleep and wake under some large tree At times I would rise up a flash of energetic freedom would dart through my soul accompanied with a faint beam of hope that flickered for a moment and then vanished I sank down again mourning over my wretched condition I was sometimes prompted to take my life and that of Covey but was prevented by a combination of hope and fear My sufferings on this plantation seem now like a dream rather than a stern reality Our house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake Bay whose broad bosom was ever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable globe Those beautiful vessels robed in purest white so delightful to the eye of freemen were to me so many shrouded ghosts to terrify and torment me with thoughts of my wretched condition I have often in the deep stillness of a summer's Sabbath stood all alone upon the lofty banks of that noble bay and traced with saddened heart and tearful eye the countless number of sails moving off to the mighty ocean The sight of these always affected me powerfully My thoughts would compel utterance and there with no audience but the Almighty I would pour out my soul's complaint in my rude way with an apostrophe to the moving multitude of ships-- You are loosed from your moorings and are free I am fast in my chains and am a slave You move merrily before the gentle gale and I sadly before the bloody whip You are freedom's swift-winged angels that fly round the world I am confined in bands of iron O that I were free O that I were on one of your gallant decks and under your protecting wing Alas betwixt me and you the turbid waters roll Go on go on O that I could also go Could I but swim If I could fly O why was I born a man of whom to make a brute The glad ship is gone she hides in the dim distance I am left in the hottest hell of unending slavery O God save me God deliver me Let me be free Is there any God Why am I a slave I will run away I will not stand it Get caught or get clear I'll try it I had as well die with ague as the fever I have only one life to lose I had as well be killed running as die standing Only think of it one hundred miles straight north and I am free Try it Yes God helping me I will It cannot be that I shall live and die a slave I will take to the water This very bay shall yet bear me into freedom The steamboats steered in a north-east course from North Point I will do the same and when I get to the head of the bay I will turn my canoe adrift and walk straight through Delaware into Pennsylvania When I get there I shall not be required to have a pass I can travel without being disturbed Let but the first opportunity offer and come what will I am off Meanwhile I will try to bear up under the yoke I am not the only slave in the world Why should I fret I can bear as much as any of them Besides I am but a boy and all boys are bound to some one It may be that my misery in slavery will only increase my happiness when I get free There is a better day coming Thus I used to think and thus I used to speak to myself goaded almost to madness at one moment and at the next reconciling myself to my wretched lot I have already intimated that my condition was much worse during the first six months of my stay at Mr Covey's than in the last six The circumstances leading to the change in Mr Covey's course toward me form an epoch in my humble history You have seen how a man was made a slave you shall see how a slave was made a man On one of the hottest days of the month of August Bill Smith William Hughes a slave named Eli and myself were engaged in fanning wheat Hughes was clearing the fanned wheat from before the fan Eli was turning Smith was feeding and I was carrying wheat to the fan The work was simple requiring strength rather than intellect yet to one entirely unused to such work it came very hard About three o'clock of that day I broke down my strength failed me I was seized with a violent aching of the head attended with extreme dizziness I trembled in every limb Finding what was coming I nerved myself up feeling it would never do to stop work I stood as long as I could stagger to the hopper with grain When I could stand no longer I fell and felt as held down by an immense weight The fan of course stopped every one had his own work to do and no one could do the work of the other and have his own go on at the same time Mr Covey was at the house about one hundred yards from the treading-yard where we were fanning On hearing the fan stop he left immediately and came to the spot where we were He hastily inquired what the matter was Bill answered that I was sick and there was no one to bring wheat to the fan I had by this time crawled away under the side of the post and rail-fence by which the yard was enclosed hoping to find relief by getting out of the sun He then asked where I was He was told by one of the hands He came to the spot and after looking at me awhile asked me what was the matter I told him as well as I could for I scarce had strength to speak He then gave me a savage kick in the side and told me to get up I tried to do so but fell back in the attempt He gave me another kick and again told me to rise I again tried and succeeded in gaining my feet but stooping to get the tub with which I was feeding the fan I again staggered and fell While down in this situation Mr Covey took up the hickory slat with which Hughes had been striking off the half-bushel measure and with it gave me a heavy blow upon the head making a large wound and the blood ran freely and with this again told me to get up I made no effort to comply having now made up my mind to let him do his worst In a short time after receiving this blow my head grew better Mr Covey had now left me to my fate At this moment I resolved for the first time to go to my master enter a complaint and ask his protection In order to this I must that afternoon walk seven miles and this under the circumstances was truly a severe undertaking I was exceedingly feeble made so as much by the kicks and blows which I received as by the severe fit of sickness to which I had been subjected I however watched my chance while Covey was looking in an opposite direction and started for St Michael's I succeeded in getting a considerable distance on my way to the woods when Covey discovered me and called after me to come back threatening what he would do if I did not come I disregarded both his calls and his threats and made my way to the woods as fast as my feeble state would allow and thinking I might be overhauled by him if I kept the road I walked through the woods keeping far enough from the road to avoid detection and near enough to prevent losing my way I had not gone far before my little strength again failed me I could go no farther I fell down and lay for a considerable time The blood was yet oozing from the wound on my head For a time I thought I should bleed to death and think now that I should have done so but that the blood so matted my hair as to stop the wound After lying there about three quarters of an hour I nerved myself up again and started on my way through bogs and briers barefooted and bareheaded tearing my feet sometimes at nearly every step and after a journey of about seven miles occupying some five hours to perform it I arrived at master's store I then presented an appearance enough to affect any but a heart of iron From the crown of my head to my feet I was covered with blood My hair was all clotted with dust and blood my shirt was stiff with blood My legs and feet were torn in sundry places with briers and thorns and were also covered with blood I suppose I looked like a man who had escaped a den of wild beasts and barely escaped them In this state I appeared before my master humbly entreating him to interpose his authority for my protection I told him all the circumstances as well as I could and it seemed as I spoke at times to affect him He would then walk the floor and seek to justify Covey by saying he expected I deserved it He asked me what I wanted I told him to let me get a new home that as sure as I lived with Mr Covey again I should live with but to die with him that Covey would surely kill me he was in a fair way for it Master Thomas ridiculed the idea that there was any danger of Mr Covey's killing me and said that he knew Mr Covey that he was a good man and that he could not think of taking me from him that should he do so he would lose the whole year's wages that I belonged to Mr Covey for one year and that I must go back to him come what might and that I must not trouble him with any more stories or that he would himself get hold of me After threatening me thus he gave me a very large dose of salts telling me that I might remain in St Michael's that night it being quite late but that I must be off back to Mr Covey's early in the morning and that if I did not he would get hold of me which meant that he would whip me I remained all night and according to his orders I started off to Covey's in the morning Saturday morning wearied in body and broken in spirit I got no supper that night or breakfast that morning I reached Covey's about nine o'clock and just as I was getting over the fence that divided Mrs Kemp's fields from ours out ran Covey with his cowskin to give me another whipping Before he could reach me I succeeded in getting to the cornfield and as the corn was very high it afforded me the means of hiding He seemed very angry and searched for me a long time My behavior was altogether unaccountable He finally gave up the chase thinking I suppose that I must come home for something to eat he would give himself no further trouble in looking for me I spent that day mostly in the woods having the alternative before me--to go home and be whipped to death or stay in the woods and be starved to death That night I fell in with Sandy Jenkins a slave with whom I was somewhat acquainted Sandy had a free wife who lived about four miles from Mr Covey's and it being Saturday he was on his way to see her I told him my circumstances and he very kindly invited me to go home with him I went home with him and talked this whole matter over and got his advice as to what course it was best for me to pursue I found Sandy an old adviser He told me with great solemnity I must go back to Covey but that before I went I must go with him into another part of the woods where there was a certain root which if I would take some of it with me carrying it always on my right side would render it impossible for Mr Covey or any other white man to whip me He said he had carried it for years and since he had done so he had never received a blow and never expected to while he carried it I at first rejected the idea that the simple carrying of a root in my pocket would have any such effect as he had said and was not disposed to take it but Sandy impressed the necessity with much earnestness telling me it could do no harm if it did no good To please him I at length took the root and according to his direction carried it upon my right side This was Sunday morning I immediately started for home and upon entering the yard gate out came Mr Covey on his way to meeting He spoke to me very kindly bade me drive the pigs from a lot near by and passed on towards the church Now this singular conduct of Mr Covey really made me begin to think that there was something in the root which Sandy had given me and had it been on any other day than Sunday I could have attributed the conduct to no other cause than the influence of that root and as it was I was half inclined to think the root to be something more than I at first had taken it to be All went well till Monday morning On this morning the virtue of the root was fully tested Long before daylight I was called to go and rub curry and feed the horses I obeyed and was glad to obey But whilst thus engaged whilst in the act of throwing down some blades from the loft Mr Covey entered the stable with a long rope and just as I was half out of the loft he caught hold of my legs and was about tying me As soon as I found what he was up to I gave a sudden spring and as I did so he holding to my legs I was brought sprawling on the stable floor Mr Covey seemed now to think he had me and could do what he pleased but at this moment--from whence came the spirit I don't know--I resolved to fight and suiting my action to the resolution I seized Covey hard by the throat and as I did so I rose He held onto me and I to him My resistance was so entirely unexpected that Covey seemed taken all aback He trembled like a leaf This gave me assurance and I held him uneasy causing the blood to run where I touched him with the ends of my fingers Mr Covey soon called out to Hughes for help Hughes came and while Covey held me attempted to tie my right hand While he was in the act of doing so I watched my chance and gave him a heavy kick close under the ribs This kick fairly sickened Hughes so that he left me in the hands of Mr Covey This kick had the effect of not only weakening Hughes but Covey also When he saw Hughes bending over with pain his courage quailed He asked me if I meant to persist in my resistance I told him I did come what might that he had used me like a brute for six months and that I was determined to be used so no longer With that he strove to drag me to a stick that was lying just out of the stable door He meant to knock me down But just as he was leaning over to get the stick I seized him with both hands by his collar and brought him by a sudden snatch to the ground By this time Bill came Covey called upon him for assistance Bill wanted to know what he could do Covey said Take hold of him take hold of him Bill said his master hired him out to work and not to help to whip me so he left Covey and myself to fight our own battle out We were at it for nearly two hours Covey at length let me go puffing and blowing at a great rate saying that if I had not resisted he would not have whipped me half so much The truth was that he had not whipped me at all I considered him as getting entirely the worst end of the bargain for he had drawn no blood from me but I had from him The whole six months afterwards that I spent with Mr Covey he never laid the weight of his finger upon me in anger He would occasionally say he didn't want to get hold of me again No thought I you need not for you will come off worse than you did before This battle with Mr Covey was the turning-point in my career as a slave It rekindled the few expiring embers of freedom and revived within me a sense of my own manhood It recalled the departed self-confidence and inspired me again with a determination to be free The gratification afforded by the triumph was a full compensation for whatever else might follow even death itself He only can understand the deep satisfaction which I experienced who has himself repelled by force the bloody arm of slavery I felt as I never felt before It was a glorious resurrection from the tomb of slavery to the heaven of freedom My long-crushed spirit rose cowardice departed bold defiance took its place and I now resolved that however long I might remain a slave in form the day had passed forever when I could be a slave in fact I did not hesitate to let it be known of me that the white man who expected to succeed in whipping must also succeed in killing me From this time I was never again what might be called fairly whipped though I remained a slave four years afterwards I had several fights but was never whipped It was for a long time a matter of surprise to me why Mr Covey did not immediately have me taken by the constable to the whipping-post and there regularly whipped for the crime of raising my hand against a white man in defence of myself And the only explanation I can now think of does not entirely satisfy me but such as it is I will give it Mr Covey enjoyed the most unbounded reputation for being a first-rate overseer and negro-breaker It was of considerable importance to him That reputation was at stake and had he sent me--a boy about sixteen years old--to the public whipping-post his reputation would have been lost so to save his reputation he suffered me to go unpunished My term of actual service to Mr Edward Covey ended on Christmas day The days between Christmas and New Year's day are allowed as holidays and accordingly we were not required to perform any labor more than to feed and take care of the stock This time we regarded as our own by the grace of our masters and we therefore used or abused it nearly as we pleased Those of us who had families at a distance were generally allowed to spend the whole six days in their society This time however was spent in various ways The staid sober thinking and industrious ones of our number would employ themselves in making corn-brooms mats horse-collars and baskets and another class of us would spend the time in hunting opossums hares and coons But by far the larger part engaged in such sports and merriments as playing ball wrestling running foot-races fiddling dancing and drinking whisky and this latter mode of spending the time was by far the most agreeable to the feelings of our masters A slave who would work during the holidays was considered by our masters as scarcely deserving them He was regarded as one who rejected the favor of his master It was deemed a disgrace not to get drunk at Christmas and he was regarded as lazy indeed who had not provided himself with the necessary means during the year to get whisky enough to last him through Christmas From what I know of the effect of these holidays upon the slave I believe them to be among the most effective means in the hands of the slaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection Were the slaveholders at once to abandon this practice I have not the slightest doubt it would lead to an immediate insurrection among the slaves These holidays serve as conductors or safety-valves to carry off the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity But for these the slave would be forced up to the wildest desperation and woe betide the slaveholder the day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation of those conductors I warn him that in such an event a spirit will go forth in their midst more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake The holidays are part and parcel of the gross fraud wrong and inhumanity of slavery They are professedly a custom established by the benevolence of the slaveholders but I undertake to say it is the result of selfishness and one of the grossest frauds committed upon the down-trodden slave They do not give the slaves this time because they would not like to have their work during its continuance but because they know it would be unsafe to deprive them of it This will be seen by the fact that the slaveholders like to have their slaves spend those days just in such a manner as to make them as glad of their ending as of their beginning Their object seems to be to disgust their slaves with freedom by plunging them into the lowest depths of dissipation For instance the slaveholders not only like to see the slave drink of his own accord but will adopt various plans to make him drunk One plan is to make bets on their slaves as to who can drink the most whisky without getting drunk and in this way they succeed in getting whole multitudes to drink to excess Thus when the slave asks for virtuous freedom the cunning slaveholder knowing his ignorance cheats him with a dose of vicious dissipation artfully labelled with the name of liberty The most of us used to drink it down and the result was just what might be supposed many of us were led to think that there was little to choose between liberty and slavery We felt and very properly too that we had almost as well be slaves to man as to rum So when the holidays ended we staggered up from the filth of our wallowing took a long breath and marched to the field-- feeling upon the whole rather glad to go from what our master had deceived us into a belief was freedom back to the arms of slavery I have said that this mode of treatment is a part of the whole system of fraud and inhumanity of slavery It is so The mode here adopted to disgust the slave with freedom by allowing him to see only the abuse of it is carried out in other things For instance a slave loves molasses he steals some His master in many cases goes off to town and buys a large quantity he returns takes his whip and commands the slave to eat the molasses until the poor fellow is made sick at the very mention of it The same mode is sometimes adopted to make the slaves refrain from asking for more food than their regular allowance A slave runs through his allowance and applies for more His master is enraged at him but not willing to send him off without food gives him more than is necessary and compels him to eat it within a given time Then if he complains that he cannot eat it he is said to be satisfied neither full nor fasting and is whipped for being hard to please I have an abundance of such illustrations of the same principle drawn from my own observation but think the cases I have cited sufficient The practice is a very common one On the first of January I left Mr Covey and went to live with Mr William Freeland who lived about three miles from St Michael's I soon found Mr Freeland a very different man from Mr Covey Though not rich he was what would be called an educated southern gentleman Mr Covey as I have shown was a well-trained negro-breaker and slave-driver The former slaveholder though he was seemed to possess some regard for honor some reverence for justice and some respect for humanity The latter seemed totally insensible to all such sentiments Mr Freeland had many of the faults peculiar to slaveholders such as being very passionate and fretful but I must do him the justice to say that he was exceedingly free from those degrading vices to which Mr Covey was constantly addicted The one was open and frank and we always knew where to find him The other was a most artful deceiver and could be understood only by such as were skilful enough to detect his cunningly-devised frauds Another advantage I gained in my new master was he made no pretensions to or profession of religion and this in my opinion was truly a great advantage I assert most unhesitatingly that the religion of the south is a mere covering for the most horrid crimes--a justifier of the most appalling barbarity--a sanctifier of the most hateful frauds--and a dark shelter under which the darkest foulest grossest and most infernal deeds of slaveholders find the strongest protection Were I to be again reduced to the chains of slavery next to that enslavement I should regard being the slave of a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me For of all slaveholders with whom I have ever met religious slaveholders are the worst I have ever found them the meanest and basest the most cruel and cowardly of all others It was my unhappy lot not only to belong to a religious slaveholder but to live in a community of such religionists Very near Mr Freeland lived the Rev Daniel Weeden and in the same neighborhood lived the Rev Rigby Hopkins These were members and ministers in the Reformed Methodist Church Mr Weeden owned among others a woman slave whose name I have forgotten This woman's back for weeks was kept literally raw made so by the lash of this merciless religious wretch He used to hire hands His maxim was Behave well or behave ill it is the duty of a master occasionally to whip a slave to remind him of his master's authority Such was his theory and such his practice Mr Hopkins was even worse than Mr Weeden His chief boast was his ability to manage slaves The peculiar feature of his government was that of whipping slaves in advance of deserving it He always managed to have one or more of his slaves to whip every Monday morning He did this to alarm their fears and strike terror into those who escaped His plan was to whip for the smallest offences to prevent the commission of large ones Mr Hopkins could always find some excuse for whipping a slave It would astonish one unaccustomed to a slaveholding life to see with what wonderful ease a slaveholder can find things of which to make occasion to whip a slave A mere look word or motion--a mistake accident or want of power--are all matters for which a slave may be whipped at any time Does a slave look dissatisfied It is said he has the devil in him and it must be whipped out Does he speak loudly when spoken to by his master Then he is getting high-minded and should be taken down a button-hole lower Does he forget to pull off his hat at the approach of a white person Then he is wanting in reverence and should be whipped for it Does he ever venture to vindicate his conduct when censured for it Then he is guilty of impudence--one of the greatest crimes of which a slave can be guilty Does he ever venture to suggest a different mode of doing things from that pointed out by his master He is indeed presumptuous and getting above himself and nothing less than a flogging will do for him Does he while ploughing break a plough--or while hoeing break a hoe It is owing to his carelessness and for it a slave must always be whipped Mr Hopkins could always find something of this sort to justify the use of the lash and he seldom failed to embrace such opportunities There was not a man in the whole county with whom the slaves who had the getting their own home would not prefer to live rather than with this Rev Mr Hopkins And yet there was not a man any where round who made higher professions of religion or was more active in revivals --more attentive to the class love-feast prayer and preaching meetings or more devotional in his family--that prayed earlier later louder and longer--than this same reverend slave-driver Rigby Hopkins But to return to Mr Freeland and to my experience while in his employment He like Mr Covey gave us enough to eat but unlike Mr Covey he also gave us sufficient time to take our meals He worked us hard but always between sunrise and sunset He required a good deal of work to be done but gave us good tools with which to work His farm was large but he employed hands enough to work it and with ease compared with many of his neighbors My treatment while in his employment was heavenly compared with what I experienced at the hands of Mr Edward Covey Mr Freeland was himself the owner of but two slaves Their names were Henry Harris and John Harris The rest of his hands he hired These consisted of myself Sandy Jenkins and Handy Caldwell Henry and John were quite intelligent and in a very little while after I went there I succeeded in creating in them a strong desire to learn how to read This desire soon sprang up in the others also They very soon mustered up some old spelling-books and nothing would do but that I must keep a Sabbath school I agreed to do so and accordingly devoted my Sundays to teaching these my loved fellow-slaves how to read Neither of them knew his letters when I went there Some of the slaves of the neighboring farms found This is the same man who gave me the roots to prevent my being whipped by Mr Covey He was a clever soul We used frequently to talk about the fight with Covey and as often as we did so he would claim my success as the result of the roots which he gave me This superstition is very common among the more ignorant slaves A slave seldom dies but that his death is attributed to trickery what was going on and also availed themselves of this little opportunity to learn to read It was understood among all who came that there must be as little display about it as possible It was necessary to keep our religious masters at St Michael's unacquainted with the fact that instead of spending the Sabbath in wrestling boxing and drinking whisky we were trying to learn how to read the will of God for they had much rather see us engaged in those degrading sports than to see us behaving like intellectual moral and accountable beings My blood boils as I think of the bloody manner in which Messrs Wright Fairbanks and Garrison West both class-leaders in connection with many others rushed in upon us with sticks and stones and broke up our virtuous little Sabbath school at St Michael's--all calling themselves Christians humble followers of the Lord Jesus Christ But I am again digressing I held my Sabbath school at the house of a free colored man whose name I deem it imprudent to mention for should it be known it might embarrass him greatly though the crime of holding the school was committed ten years ago I had at one time over forty scholars and those of the right sort ardently desiring to learn They were of all ages though mostly men and women I look back to those Sundays with an amount of pleasure not to be expressed They were great days to my soul The work of instructing my dear fellow-slaves was the sweetest engagement with which I was ever blessed We loved each other and to leave them at the close of the Sabbath was a severe cross indeed When I think that these precious souls are to-day shut up in the prison-house of slavery my feelings overcome me and I am almost ready to ask Does a righteous God govern the universe and for what does he hold the thunders in his right hand if not to smite the oppressor and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the spoiler These dear souls came not to Sabbath school because it was popular to do so nor did I teach them because it was reputable to be thus engaged Every moment they spent in that school they were liable to be taken up and given thirty-nine lashes They came because they wished to learn Their minds had been starved by their cruel masters They had been shut up in mental darkness I taught them because it was the delight of my soul to be doing something that looked like bettering the condition of my race I kept up my school nearly the whole year I lived with Mr Freeland and beside my Sabbath school I devoted three evenings in the week during the winter to teaching the slaves at home And I have the happiness to know that several of those who came to Sabbath school learned how to read and that one at least is now free through my agency The year passed off smoothly It seemed only about half as long as the year which preceded it I went through it without receiving a single blow I will give Mr Freeland the credit of being the best master I ever had till I became my own master For the ease with which I passed the year I was however somewhat indebted to the society of my fellow-slaves They were noble souls they not only possessed loving hearts but brave ones We were linked and inter-linked with each other I loved them with a love stronger than any thing I have experienced since It is sometimes said that we slaves do not love and confide in each other In answer to this assertion I can say I never loved any or confided in any people more than my fellow-slaves and especially those with whom I lived at Mr Freeland's I believe we would have died for each other We never undertook to do any thing of any importance without a mutual consultation We never moved separately We were one and as much so by our tempers and dispositions as by the mutual hardships to which we were necessarily subjected by our condition as slaves At the close of the year Mr Freeland again hired me of my master for the year But by this time I began to want to live upon free land as well as with Freeland and I was no longer content therefore to live with him or any other slaveholder I began with the commencement of the year to prepare myself for a final struggle which should decide my fate one way or the other My tendency was upward I was fast approaching manhood and year after year had passed and I was still a slave These thought roused me--I must do something I therefore resolved that should not pass without witnessing an attempt on my part to secure my liberty But I was not willing to cherish this determination alone My fellow-slaves were dear to me I was anxious to have them participate with me in this my life-giving determination I therefore though with great prudence commenced early to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition and to imbue their minds with thoughts of freedom I bent myself to devising ways and means for our escape and meanwhile strove on all fitting occasions to impress them with the gross fraud and inhumanity of slavery I went first to Henry next to John then to the others I found in them all warm hearts and noble spirits They were ready to hear and ready to act when a feasible plan should be proposed This was what I wanted I talked to them of our want of manhood if we submitted to our enslavement without at least one noble effort to be free We met often and consulted frequently and told our hopes and fears recounted the difficulties real and imagined which we should be called on to meet At times we were almost disposed to give up and try to content ourselves with our wretched lot at others we were firm and unbending in our determination to go Whenever we suggested any plan there was shrinking --the odds were fearful Our path was beset with the greatest obstacles and if we succeeded in gaining the end of it our right to be free was yet questionable--we were yet liable to be returned to bondage We could see no spot this side of the ocean where we could be free We knew nothing about Canada Our knowledge of the north did not extend farther than New York and to go there and be forever harassed with the frightful liability of being returned to slavery--with the certainty of being treated tenfold worse than before--the thought was truly a horrible one and one which it was not easy to overcome The case sometimes stood thus At every gate through which we were to pass we saw a watchman--at every ferry a guard-- on every bridge a sentinel--and in every wood a patrol We were hemmed in upon every side Here were the difficulties real or imagined--the good to be sought and the evil to be shunned On the one hand there stood slavery a stern reality glaring frightfully upon us--its robes already crimsoned with the blood of millions and even now feasting itself greedily upon our own flesh On the other hand away back in the dim distance under the flickering light of the north star behind some craggy hill or snow-covered mountain stood a doubtful freedom--half frozen--beckoning us to come and share its hospitality This in itself was sometimes enough to stagger us but when we permitted ourselves to survey the road we were frequently appalled Upon either side we saw grim death assuming the most horrid shapes Now it was starvation causing us to eat our own flesh--now we were contending with the waves and were drowned--now we were overtaken and torn to pieces by the fangs of the terrible bloodhound We were stung by scorpions chased by wild beasts bitten by snakes and finally after having nearly reached the desired spot--after swimming rivers encountering wild beasts sleeping in the woods suffering hunger and nakedness--we were overtaken by our pursuers and in our resistance we were shot dead upon the spot I say this picture sometimes appalled us and made us rather bear those ills we had Than fly to others that we knew not of In coming to a fixed determination to run away we did more than Patrick Henry when he resolved upon liberty or death With us it was a doubtful liberty at most and almost certain death if we failed For my part I should prefer death to hopeless bondage Sandy one of our number gave up the notion but still encouraged us Our company then consisted of Henry Harris John Harris Henry Bailey Charles Roberts and myself Henry Bailey was my uncle and belonged to my master Charles married my aunt he belonged to my master's father-in-law Mr William Hamilton The plan we finally concluded upon was to get a large canoe belonging to Mr Hamilton and upon the Saturday night previous to Easter holidays paddle directly up the Chesapeake Bay On our arrival at the head of the bay a distance of seventy or eighty miles from where we lived it was our purpose to turn our canoe adrift and follow the guidance of the north star till we got beyond the limits of Maryland Our reason for taking the water route was that we were less liable to be suspected as runaways we hoped to be regarded as fishermen whereas if we should take the land route we should be subjected to interruptions of almost every kind Any one having a white face and being so disposed could stop us and subject us to examination The week before our intended start I wrote several protections one for each of us As well as I can remember they were in the following words to wit-- THIS is to certify that I the undersigned have given the bearer my servant full liberty to go to Baltimore and spend the Easter holidays Written with mine own hand c WILLIAM HAMILTON Near St Michael's in Talbot county Maryland We were not going to Baltimore but in going up the bay we went toward Baltimore and these protections were only intended to protect us while on the bay As the time drew near for our departure our anxiety became more and more intense It was truly a matter of life and death with us The strength of our determination was about to be fully tested At this time I was very active in explaining every difficulty removing every doubt dispelling every fear and inspiring all with the firmness indispensable to success in our undertaking assuring them that half was gained the instant we made the move we had talked long enough we were now ready to move if not now we never should be and if we did not intend to move now we had as well fold our arms sit down and acknowledge ourselves fit only to be slaves This none of us were prepared to acknowledge Every man stood firm and at our last meeting we pledged ourselves afresh in the most solemn manner that at the time appointed we would certainly start in pursuit of freedom This was in the middle of the week at the end of which we were to be off We went as usual to our several fields of labor but with bosoms highly agitated with thoughts of our truly hazardous undertaking We tried to conceal our feelings as much as possible and I think we succeeded very well After a painful waiting the Saturday morning whose night was to witness our departure came I hailed it with joy bring what of sadness it might Friday night was a sleepless one for me I probably felt more anxious than the rest because I was by common consent at the head of the whole affair The responsibility of success or failure lay heavily upon me The glory of the one and the confusion of the other were alike mine The first two hours of that morning were such as I never experienced before and hope never to again Early in the morning we went as usual to the field We were spreading manure and all at once while thus engaged I was overwhelmed with an indescribable feeling in the fulness of which I turned to Sandy who was near by and said We are betrayed Well said he that thought has this moment struck me We said no more I was never more certain of any thing The horn was blown as usual and we went up from the field to the house for breakfast I went for the form more than for want of any thing to eat that morning Just as I got to the house in looking out at the lane gate I saw four white men with two colored men The white men were on horseback and the colored ones were walking behind as if tied I watched them a few moments till they got up to our lane gate Here they halted and tied the colored men to the gate-post I was not yet certain as to what the matter was In a few moments in rode Mr Hamilton with a speed betokening great excitement He came to the door and inquired if Master William was in He was told he was at the barn Mr Hamilton without dismounting rode up to the barn with extraordinary speed In a few moments he and Mr Freeland returned to the house By this time the three constables rode up and in great haste dismounted tied their horses and met Master William and Mr Hamilton returning from the barn and after talking awhile they all walked up to the kitchen door There was no one in the kitchen but myself and John Henry and Sandy were up at the barn Mr Freeland put his head in at the door and called me by name saying there were some gentlemen at the door who wished to see me I stepped to the door and inquired what they wanted They at once seized me and without giving me any satisfaction tied me--lashing my hands closely together I insisted upon knowing what the matter was They at length said that they had learned I had been in a scrape and that I was to be examined before my master and if their information proved false I should not be hurt In a few moments they succeeded in tying John They then turned to Henry who had by this time returned and commanded him to cross his hands I won't said Henry in a firm tone indicating his readiness to meet the consequences of his refusal Won't you said Tom Graham the constable No I won't said Henry in a still stronger tone With this two of the constables pulled out their shining pistols and swore by their Creator that they would make him cross his hands or kill him Each cocked his pistol and with fingers on the trigger walked up to Henry saying at the same time if he did not cross his hands they would blow his damned heart out Shoot me shoot me said Henry you can't kill me but once Shoot shoot--and be damned I won't be tied This he said in a tone of loud defiance and at the same time with a motion as quick as lightning he with one single stroke dashed the pistols from the hand of each constable As he did this all hands fell upon him and after beating him some time they finally overpowered him and got him tied During the scuffle I managed I know not how to get my pass out and without being discovered put it into the fire We were all now tied and just as we were to leave for Easton jail Betsy Freeland mother of William Freeland came to the door with her hands full of biscuits and divided them between Henry and John She then delivered herself of a speech to the following effect--addressing herself to me she said You devil You yellow devil it was you that put it into the heads of Henry and John to run away But for you you long-legged mulatto devil Henry nor John would never have thought of such a thing I made no reply and was immediately hurried off towards St Michael's Just a moment previous to the scuffle with Henry Mr Hamilton suggested the propriety of making a search for the protections which he had understood Frederick had written for himself and the rest But just at the moment he was about carrying his proposal into effect his aid was needed in helping to tie Henry and the excitement attending the scuffle caused them either to forget or to deem it unsafe under the circumstances to search So we were not yet convicted of the intention to run away When we got about half way to St Michael's while the constables having us in charge were looking ahead Henry inquired of me what he should do with his pass I told him to eat it with his biscuit and own nothing and we passed the word around Own nothing and Own nothing said we all Our confidence in each other was unshaken We were resolved to succeed or fail together after the calamity had befallen us as much as before We were now prepared for any thing We were to be dragged that morning fifteen miles behind horses and then to be placed in the Easton jail When we reached St Michael's we underwent a sort of examination We all denied that we ever intended to run away We did this more to bring out the evidence against us than from any hope of getting clear of being sold for as I have said we were ready for that The fact was we cared but little where we went so we went together Our greatest concern was about separation We dreaded that more than any thing this side of death We found the evidence against us to be the testimony of one person our master would not tell who it was but we came to a unanimous decision among ourselves as to who their informant was We were sent off to the jail at Easton When we got there we were delivered up to the sheriff Mr Joseph Graham and by him placed in jail Henry John and myself were placed in one room together-- Charles and Henry Bailey in another Their object in separating us was to hinder concert We had been in jail scarcely twenty minutes when a swarm of slave traders and agents for slave traders flocked into jail to look at us and to ascertain if we were for sale Such a set of beings I never saw before I felt myself surrounded by so many fiends from perdition A band of pirates never looked more like their father the devil They laughed and grinned over us saying Ah my boys we have got you haven't we And after taunting us in various ways they one by one went into an examination of us with intent to ascertain our value They would impudently ask us if we would not like to have them for our masters We would make them no answer and leave them to find out as best they could Then they would curse and swear at us telling us that they could take the devil out of us in a very little while if we were only in their hands While in jail we found ourselves in much more comfortable quarters than we expected when we went there We did not get much to eat nor that which was very good but we had a good clean room from the windows of which we could see what was going on in the street which was very much better than though we had been placed in one of the dark damp cells Upon the whole we got along very well so far as the jail and its keeper were concerned Immediately after the holidays were over contrary to all our expectations Mr Hamilton and Mr Freeland came up to Easton and took Charles the two Henrys and John out of jail and carried them home leaving me alone I regarded this separation as a final one It caused me more pain than any thing else in the whole transaction I was ready for any thing rather than separation I supposed that they had consulted together and had decided that as I was the whole cause of the intention of the others to run away it was hard to make the innocent suffer with the guilty and that they had therefore concluded to take the others home and sell me as a warning to the others that remained It is due to the noble Henry to say he seemed almost as reluctant at leaving the prison as at leaving home to come to the prison But we knew we should in all probability be separated if we were sold and since he was in their hands he concluded to go peaceably home I was now left to my fate I was all alone and within the walls of a stone prison But a few days before and I was full of hope I expected to have been safe in a land of freedom but now I was covered with gloom sunk down to the utmost despair I thought the possibility of freedom was gone I was kept in this way about one week at the end of which Captain Auld my master to my surprise and utter astonishment came up and took me out with the intention of sending me with a gentleman of his acquaintance into Alabama But from some cause or other he did not send me to Alabama but concluded to send me back to Baltimore to live again with his brother Hugh and to learn a trade Thus after an absence of three years and one month I was once more permitted to return to my old home at Baltimore My master sent me away because there existed against me a very great prejudice in the community and he feared I might be killed In a few weeks after I went to Baltimore Master Hugh hired me to Mr William Gardner an extensive ship-builder on Fell's Point I was put there to learn how to calk It however proved a very unfavorable place for the accomplishment of this object Mr Gardner was engaged that spring in building two large man-of-war brigs professedly for the Mexican government The vessels were to be launched in the July of that year and in failure thereof Mr Gardner was to lose a considerable sum so that when I entered all was hurry There was no time to learn any thing Every man had to do that which he knew how to do In entering the ship-yard my orders from Mr Gardner were to do whatever the carpenters commanded me to do This was placing me at the beck and call of about seventy-five men I was to regard all these as masters Their word was to be my law My situation was a most trying one At times I needed a dozen pair of hands I was called a dozen ways in the space of a single minute Three or four voices would strike my ear at the same moment It was--Fred come help me to cant this timber here--Fred come carry this timber yonder--Fred bring that roller here--Fred go get a fresh can of water-- Fred come help saw off the end of this timber-- Fred go quick and get the crowbar--Fred hold on the end of this fall--Fred go to the blacksmith's shop and get a new punch--Hurra Fred run and bring me a cold chisel--I say Fred bear a hand and get up a fire as quick as lightning under that steam-box--Halloo nigger come turn this grindstone--Come come move move and bowse this timber forward--I say darky blast your eyes why don't you heat up some pitch-- Halloo halloo halloo Three voices at the same time Come here--Go there--Hold on where you are Damn you if you move I'll knock your brains out This was my school for eight months and I might have remained there longer but for a most horrid fight I had with four of the white apprentices in which my left eye was nearly knocked out and I was horribly mangled in other respects The facts in the case were these Until a very little while after I went there white and black ship-carpenters worked side by side and no one seemed to see any impropriety in it All hands seemed to be very well satisfied Many of the black carpenters were freemen Things seemed to be going on very well All at once the white carpenters knocked off and said they would not work with free colored workmen Their reason for this as alleged was that if free colored carpenters were encouraged they would soon take the trade into their own hands and poor white men would be thrown out of employment They therefore felt called upon at once to put a stop to it And taking advantage of Mr Gardner's necessities they broke off swearing they would work no longer unless he would discharge his black carpenters Now though this did not extend to me in form it did reach me in fact My fellow-apprentices very soon began to feel it degrading to them to work with me They began to put on airs and talk about the niggers taking the country saying we all ought to be killed and being encouraged by the journeymen they commenced making my condition as hard as they could by hectoring me around and sometimes striking me I of course kept the vow I made after the fight with Mr Covey and struck back again regardless of consequences and while I kept them from combining I succeeded very well for I could whip the whole of them taking them separately They however at length combined and came upon me armed with sticks stones and heavy handspikes One came in front with a half brick There was one at each side of me and one behind me While I was attending to those in front and on either side the one behind ran up with the handspike and struck me a heavy blow upon the head It stunned me I fell and with this they all ran upon me and fell to beating me with their fists I let them lay on for a while gathering strength In an instant I gave a sudden surge and rose to my hands and knees Just as I did that one of their number gave me with his heavy boot a powerful kick in the left eye My eyeball seemed to have burst When they saw my eye closed and badly swollen they left me With this I seized the handspike and for a time pursued them But here the carpenters interfered and I thought I might as well give it up It was impossible to stand my hand against so many All this took place in sight of not less than fifty white ship-carpenters and not one interposed a friendly word but some cried Kill the damned nigger Kill him kill him He struck a white person I found my only chance for life was in flight I succeeded in getting away without an additional blow and barely so for to strike a white man is death by Lynch law--and that was the law in Mr Gardner's ship-yard nor is there much of any other out of Mr Gardner's ship-yard I went directly home and told the story of my wrongs to Master Hugh and I am happy to say of him irreligious as he was his conduct was heavenly compared with that of his brother Thomas under similar circumstances He listened attentively to my narration of the circumstances leading to the savage outrage and gave many proofs of his strong indignation at it The heart of my once overkind mistress was again melted into pity My puffed-out eye and blood-covered face moved her to tears She took a chair by me washed the blood from my face and with a mother's tenderness bound up my head covering the wounded eye with a lean piece of fresh beef It was almost compensation for my suffering to witness once more a manifestation of kindness from this my once affectionate old mistress Master Hugh was very much enraged He gave expression to his feelings by pouring out curses upon the heads of those who did the deed As soon as I got a little the better of my bruises he took me with him to Esquire Watson's on Bond Street to see what could be done about the matter Mr Watson inquired who saw the assault committed Master Hugh told him it was done in Mr Gardner's ship-yard at midday where there were a large company of men at work As to that he said the deed was done and there was no question as to who did it His answer was he could do nothing in the case unless some white man would come forward and testify He could issue no warrant on my word If I had been killed in the presence of a thousand colored people their testimony combined would have been insufficient to have arrested one of the murderers Master Hugh for once was compelled to say this state of things was too bad Of course it was impossible to get any white man to volunteer his testimony in my behalf and against the white young men Even those who may have sympathized with me were not prepared to do this It required a degree of courage unknown to them to do so for just at that time the slightest manifestation of humanity toward a colored person was denounced as abolitionism and that name subjected its bearer to frightful liabilities The watchwords of the bloody-minded in that region and in those days were Damn the abolitionists and Damn the niggers There was nothing done and probably nothing would have been done if I had been killed Such was and such remains the state of things in the Christian city of Baltimore Master Hugh finding he could get no redress refused to let me go back again to Mr Gardner He kept me himself and his wife dressed my wound till I was again restored to health He then took me into the ship-yard of which he was foreman in the employment of Mr Walter Price There I was immediately set to calking and very soon learned the art of using my mallet and irons In the course of one year from the time I left Mr Gardner's I was able to command the highest wages given to the most experienced calkers I was now of some importance to my master I was bringing him from six to seven dollars per week I sometimes brought him nine dollars per week my wages were a dollar and a half a day After learning how to calk I sought my own employment made my own contracts and collected the money which I earned My pathway became much more smooth than before my condition was now much more comfortable When I could get no calking to do I did nothing During these leisure times those old notions about freedom would steal over me again When in Mr Gardner's employment I was kept in such a perpetual whirl of excitement I could think of nothing scarcely but my life and in thinking of my life I almost forgot my liberty I have observed this in my experience of slavery --that whenever my condition was improved instead of its increasing my contentment it only increased my desire to be free and set me to thinking of plans to gain my freedom I have found that to make a contented slave it is necessary to make a thoughtless one It is necessary to darken his moral and mental vision and as far as possible to annihilate the power of reason He must be able to detect no inconsistencies in slavery he must be made to feel that slavery is right and he can be brought to that only when be ceases to be a man I was now getting as I have said one dollar and fifty cents per day I contracted for it I earned it it was paid to me it was rightfully my own yet upon each returning Saturday night I was compelled to deliver every cent of that money to Master Hugh And why Not because he earned it--not because he had any hand in earning it-- not because I owed it to him--nor because he possessed the slightest shadow of a right to it but solely because he had the power to compel me to give it up The right of the grim-visaged pirate upon the high seas is exactly the same XI I NOW come to that part of my life during which I planned and finally succeeded in making my escape from slavery But before narrating any of the peculiar circumstances I deem it proper to make known my intention not to state all the facts connected with the transaction My reasons for pursuing this course may be understood from the following First were I to give a minute statement of all the facts it is not only possible but quite probable that others would thereby be involved in the most embarrassing difficulties Secondly such a statement would most undoubtedly induce greater vigilance on the part of slaveholders than has existed heretofore among them which would of course be the means of guarding a door whereby some dear brother bondman might escape his galling chains I deeply regret the necessity that impels me to suppress any thing of importance connected with my experience in slavery It would afford me great pleasure indeed as well as materially add to the interest of my narrative were I at liberty to gratify a curiosity which I know exists in the minds of many by an accurate statement of all the facts pertaining to my most fortunate escape But I must deprive myself of this pleasure and the curious of the gratification which such a statement would afford I would allow myself to suffer under the greatest imputations which evil-minded men might suggest rather than exculpate myself and thereby run the hazard of closing the slightest avenue by which a brother slave might clear himself of the chains and fetters of slavery I have never approved of the very public manner in which some of our western friends have conducted what they call the underground railroad but which I think by their open declarations has been made most emphatically the upperground railroad I honor those good men and women for their noble daring and applaud them for willingly subjecting themselves to bloody persecution by openly avowing their participation in the escape of slaves I however can see very little good resulting from such a course either to themselves or the slaves escaping while upon the other hand I see and feel assured that those open declarations are a positive evil to the slaves remaining who are seeking to escape They do nothing towards enlightening the slave whilst they do much towards enlightening the master They stimulate him to greater watchfulness and enhance his power to capture his slave We owe something to the slaves south of the line as well as to those north of it and in aiding the latter on their way to freedom we should be careful to do nothing which would be likely to hinder the former from escaping from slavery I would keep the merciless slaveholder profoundly ignorant of the means of flight adopted by the slave I would leave him to imagine himself surrounded by myriads of invisible tormentors ever ready to snatch from his infernal grasp his trembling prey Let him be left to feel his way in the dark let darkness commensurate with his crime hover over him and let him feel that at every step he takes in pursuit of the flying bondman he is running the frightful risk of having his hot brains dashed out by an invisible agency Let us render the tyrant no aid let us not hold the light by which he can trace the footprints of our flying brother But enough of this I will now proceed to the statement of those facts connected with my escape for which I am alone responsible and for which no one can be made to suffer but myself In the early part of the year I became quite restless I could see no reason why I should at the end of each week pour the reward of my toil into the purse of my master When I carried to him my weekly wages he would after counting the money look me in the face with a robber-like fierceness and ask Is this all He was satisfied with nothing less than the last cent He would however when I made him six dollars sometimes give me six cents to encourage me It had the opposite effect I regarded it as a sort of admission of my right to the whole The fact that he gave me any part of my wages was proof to my mind that he believed me entitled to the whole of them I always felt worse for having received any thing for I feared that the giving me a few cents would ease his conscience and make him feel himself to be a pretty honorable sort of robber My discontent grew upon me I was ever on the look-out for means of escape and finding no direct means I determined to try to hire my time with a view of getting money with which to make my escape In the spring of when Master Thomas came to Baltimore to purchase his spring goods I got an opportunity and applied to him to allow me to hire my time He unhesitatingly refused my request and told me this was another stratagem by which to escape He told me I could go nowhere but that he could get me and that in the event of my running away he should spare no pains in his efforts to catch me He exhorted me to content myself and be obedient He told me if I would be happy I must lay out no plans for the future He said if I behaved myself properly he would take care of me Indeed he advised me to complete thoughtlessness of the future and taught me to depend solely upon him for happiness He seemed to see fully the pressing necessity of setting aside my intellectual nature in order to contentment in slavery But in spite of him and even in spite of myself I continued to think and to think about the injustice of my enslavement and the means of escape About two months after this I applied to Master Hugh for the privilege of hiring my time He was not acquainted with the fact that I had applied to Master Thomas and had been refused He too at first seemed disposed to refuse but after some reflection he granted me the privilege and proposed the following terms I was to be allowed all my time make all contracts with those for whom I worked and find my own employment and in return for this liberty I was to pay him three dollars at the end of each week find myself in calking tools and in board and clothing My board was two dollars and a half per week This with the wear and tear of clothing and calking tools made my regular expenses about six dollars per week This amount I was compelled to make up or relinquish the privilege of hiring my time Rain or shine work or no work at the end of each week the money must be forthcoming or I must give up my privilege This arrangement it will be perceived was decidedly in my master's favor It relieved him of all need of looking after me His money was sure He received all the benefits of slaveholding without its evils while I endured all the evils of a slave and suffered all the care and anxiety of a freeman I found it a hard bargain But hard as it was I thought it better than the old mode of getting along It was a step towards freedom to be allowed to bear the responsibilities of a freeman and I was determined to hold on upon it I bent myself to the work of making money I was ready to work at night as well as day and by the most untiring perseverance and industry I made enough to meet my expenses and lay up a little money every week I went on thus from May till August Master Hugh then refused to allow me to hire my time longer The ground for his refusal was a failure on my part one Saturday night to pay him for my week's time This failure was occasioned by my attending a camp meeting about ten miles from Baltimore During the week I had entered into an engagement with a number of young friends to start from Baltimore to the camp ground early Saturday evening and being detained by my employer I was unable to get down to Master Hugh's without disappointing the company I knew that Master Hugh was in no special need of the money that night I therefore decided to go to camp meeting and upon my return pay him the three dollars I staid at the camp meeting one day longer than I intended when I left But as soon as I returned I called upon him to pay him what he considered his due I found him very angry he could scarce restrain his wrath He said he had a great mind to give me a severe whipping He wished to know how I dared go out of the city without asking his permission I told him I hired my time and while I paid him the price which he asked for it I did not know that I was bound to ask him when and where I should go This reply troubled him and after reflecting a few moments he turned to me and said I should hire my time no longer that the next thing he should know of I would be running away Upon the same plea he told me to bring my tools and clothing home forthwith I did so but instead of seeking work as I had been accustomed to do previously to hiring my time I spent the whole week without the performance of a single stroke of work I did this in retaliation Saturday night he called upon me as usual for my week's wages I told him I had no wages I had done no work that week Here we were upon the point of coming to blows He raved and swore his determination to get hold of me I did not allow myself a single word but was resolved if he laid the weight of his hand upon me it should be blow for blow He did not strike me but told me that he would find me in constant employment in future I thought the matter over during the next day Sunday and finally resolved upon the third day of September as the day upon which I would make a second attempt to secure my freedom I now had three weeks during which to prepare for my journey Early on Monday morning before Master Hugh had time to make any engagement for me I went out and got employment of Mr Butler at his ship-yard near the drawbridge upon what is called the City Block thus making it unnecessary for him to seek employment for me At the end of the week I brought him between eight and nine dollars He seemed very well pleased and asked me why I did not do the same the week before He little knew what my plans were My object in working steadily was to remove any suspicion he might entertain of my intent to run away and in this I succeeded admirably I suppose he thought I was never better satisfied with my condition than at the very time during which I was planning my escape The second week passed and again I carried him my full wages and so well pleased was he that he gave me twenty-five cents quite a large sum for a slaveholder to give a slave and bade me to make a good use of it I told him I would Things went on without very smoothly indeed but within there was trouble It is impossible for me to describe my feelings as the time of my contemplated start drew near I had a number of warm-hearted friends in Baltimore--friends that I loved almost as I did my life --and the thought of being separated from them forever was painful beyond expression It is my opinion that thousands would escape from slavery who now remain but for the strong cords of affection that bind them to their friends The thought of leaving my friends was decidedly the most painful thought with which I had to contend The love of them was my tender point and shook my decision more than all things else Besides the pain of separation the dread and apprehension of a failure exceeded what I had experienced at my first attempt The appalling defeat I then sustained returned to torment me I felt assured that if I failed in this attempt my case would be a hopeless one--it would seat my fate as a slave forever I could not hope to get off with any thing less than the severest punishment and being placed beyond the means of escape It required no very vivid imagination to depict the most frightful scenes through which I should have to pass in case I failed The wretchedness of slavery and the blessedness of freedom were perpetually before me It was life and death with me But I remained firm and according to my resolution on the third day of September I left my chains and succeeded in reaching New York without the slightest interruption of any kind How I did so-- what means I adopted--what direction I travelled and by what mode of conveyance--I must leave unexplained for the reasons before mentioned I have been frequently asked how I felt when I found myself in a free State I have never been able to answer the question with any satisfaction to myself It was a moment of the highest excitement I ever experienced I suppose I felt as one may imagine the unarmed mariner to feel when he is rescued by a friendly man-of-war from the pursuit of a pirate In writing to a dear friend immediately after my arrival at New York I said I felt like one who had escaped a den of hungry lions This state of mind however very soon subsided and I was again seized with a feeling of great insecurity and loneliness I was yet liable to be taken back and subjected to all the tortures of slavery This in itself was enough to damp the ardor of my enthusiasm But the loneliness overcame me There I was in the midst of thousands and yet a perfect stranger without home and without friends in the midst of thousands of my own brethren--children of a common Father and yet I dared not to unfold to any one of them my sad condition I was afraid to speak to any one for fear of speaking to the wrong one and thereby falling into the hands of money-loving kidnappers whose business it was to lie in wait for the panting fugitive as the ferocious beasts of the forest lie in wait for their prey The motto which I adopted when I started from slavery was this--Trust no man I saw in every white man an enemy and in almost every colored man cause for distrust It was a most painful situation and to understand it one must needs experience it or imagine himself in similar circumstances Let him be a fugitive slave in a strange land--a land given up to be the hunting-ground for slaveholders--whose inhabitants are legalized kidnappers--where he is every moment subjected to the terrible liability of being seized upon by his fellowmen as the hideous crocodile seizes upon his prey-- say let him place himself in my situation--without home or friends--without money or credit--wanting shelter and no one to give it--wanting bread and no money to buy it--and at the same time let him feel that he is pursued by merciless men-hunters and in total darkness as to what to do where to go or where to stay-- perfectly helpless both as to the means of defence and means of escape--in the midst of plenty yet suffering the terrible gnawings of hunger-- in the midst of houses yet having no home--among fellow-men yet feeling as if in the midst of wild beasts whose greediness to swallow up the trembling and half-famished fugitive is only equalled by that with which the monsters of the deep swallow up the helpless fish upon which they subsist--I say let him be placed in this most trying situation--the situation in which I was placed-- then and not till then will he fully appreciate the hardships of and know how to sympathize with the toil-worn and whip-scarred fugitive slave Thank Heaven I remained but a short time in this distressed situation I was relieved from it by the humane hand of Mr DAVID RUGGLES whose vigilance kindness and perseverance I shall never forget I am glad of an opportunity to express as far as words can the love and gratitude I bear him Mr Ruggles is now afflicted with blindness and is himself in need of the same kind offices which he was once so forward in the performance of toward others I had been in New York but a few days when Mr Ruggles sought me out and very kindly took me to his boarding-house at the corner of Church and Lespenard Streets Mr Ruggles was then very deeply engaged in the memorable Darg case as well as attending to a number of other fugitive slaves devising ways and means for their successful escape and though watched and hemmed in on almost every side he seemed to be more than a match for his enemies Very soon after I went to Mr Ruggles he wished to know of me where I wanted to go as he deemed it unsafe for me to remain in New York I told him I was a calker and should like to go where I could get work I thought of going to Canada but he decided against it and in favor of my going to New Bedford thinking I should be able to get work there at my trade At this time Anna my intended wife came on for I wrote to her immediately after my arrival at New York notwithstanding my homeless houseless and helpless condition informing her of my successful flight and wishing her to come on forthwith In a few days after her arrival Mr Ruggles called in the Rev J W C Pennington who in the presence of Mr Ruggles Mrs Michaels and two or three others performed the marriage ceremony and gave us a certificate of which the following is an exact copy-- THIS may certify that I joined together in holy matrimony Frederick Johnson and Anna Murray as man and wife in the presence of Mr David Ruggles and Mrs Michaels JAMES W C PENNINGTON New York Sept Upon receiving this certificate and a five-dollar bill from Mr Ruggles I shouldered one part of our baggage and Anna took up the other and we set out forthwith to take passage on board of the steamboat John W Richmond for Newport on our way to New She was free I had changed my name from Frederick Bailey to that of Johnson Bedford Mr Ruggles gave me a letter to a Mr Shaw in Newport and told me in case my money did not serve me to New Bedford to stop in Newport and obtain further assistance but upon our arrival at Newport we were so anxious to get to a place of safety that notwithstanding we lacked the necessary money to pay our fare we decided to take seats in the stage and promise to pay when we got to New Bedford We were encouraged to do this by two excellent gentlemen residents of New Bedford whose names I afterward ascertained to be Joseph Ricketson and William C Taber They seemed at once to understand our circumstances and gave us such assurance of their friendliness as put us fully at ease in their presence It was good indeed to meet with such friends at such a time Upon reaching New Bedford we were directed to the house of Mr Nathan Johnson by whom we were kindly received and hospitably provided for Both Mr and Mrs Johnson took a deep and lively interest in our welfare They proved themselves quite worthy of the name of abolitionists When the stage-driver found us unable to pay our fare he held on upon our baggage as security for the debt I had but to mention the fact to Mr Johnson and he forthwith advanced the money We now began to feel a degree of safety and to prepare ourselves for the duties and responsibilities of a life of freedom On the morning after our arrival at New Bedford while at the breakfast-table the question arose as to what name I should be called by The name given me by my mother was Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey I however had dispensed with the two middle names long before I left Maryland so that I was generally known by the name of Frederick Bailey I started from Baltimore bearing the name of Stanley When I got to New York I again changed my name to Frederick Johnson and thought that would be the last change But when I got to New Bedford I found it necessary again to change my name The reason of this necessity was that there were so many Johnsons in New Bedford it was already quite difficult to distinguish between them I gave Mr Johnson the privilege of choosing me a name but told him be must not take from me the name of Frederick I must hold on to that to preserve a sense of my identity Mr Johnson had just been reading the Lady of the Lake and at once suggested that my name be Douglass From that time until now I have been called Frederick Douglass and as I am more widely known by that name than by either of the others I shall continue to use it as my own I was quite disappointed at the general appearance of things in New Bedford The impression which I had received respecting the character and condition of the people of the north I found to be singularly erroneous I had very strangely supposed while in slavery that few of the comforts and scarcely any of the luxuries of life were enjoyed at the north compared with what were enjoyed by the slaveholders of the south I probably came to this conclusion from the fact that northern people owned no slaves I supposed that they were about upon a level with the non-slaveholding population of the south I knew they were exceedingly poor and I had been accustomed to regard their poverty as the necessary consequence of their being non-slaveholders I had somehow imbibed the opinion that in the absence of slaves there could be no wealth and very little refinement And upon coming to the north I expected to meet with a rough hard-handed and uncultivated population living in the most Spartan-like simplicity knowing nothing of the ease luxury pomp and grandeur of southern slaveholders Such being my conjectures any one acquainted with the appearance of New Bedford may very readily infer how palpably I must have seen my mistake In the afternoon of the day when I reached New Bedford I visited the wharves to take a view of the shipping Here I found myself surrounded with the strongest proofs of wealth Lying at the wharves and riding in the stream I saw many ships of the finest model in the best order and of the largest size Upon the right and left I was walled in by granite warehouses of the widest dimensions stowed to their utmost capacity with the necessaries and comforts of life Added to this almost every body seemed to be at work but noiselessly so compared with what I had been accustomed to in Baltimore There were no loud songs heard from those engaged in loading and unloading ships I heard no deep oaths or horrid curses on the laborer I saw no whipping of men but all seemed to go smoothly on Every man appeared to understand his work and went at it with a sober yet cheerful earnestness which betokened the deep interest which he felt in what he was doing as well as a sense of his own dignity as a man To me this looked exceedingly strange From the wharves I strolled around and over the town gazing with wonder and admiration at the splendid churches beautiful dwellings and finely-cultivated gardens evincing an amount of wealth comfort taste and refinement such as I had never seen in any part of slaveholding Maryland Every thing looked clean new and beautiful I saw few or no dilapidated houses with poverty-stricken inmates no half-naked children and barefooted women such as I had been accustomed to see in Hillsborough Easton St Michael's and Baltimore The people looked more able stronger healthier and happier than those of Maryland I was for once made glad by a view of extreme wealth without being saddened by seeing extreme poverty But the most astonishing as well as the most interesting thing to me was the condition of the colored people a great many of whom like myself had escaped thither as a refuge from the hunters of men I found many who had not been seven years out of their chains living in finer houses and evidently enjoying more of the comforts of life than the average of slaveholders in Maryland I will venture to assert that my friend Mr Nathan Johnson of whom I can say with a grateful heart I was hungry and he gave me meat I was thirsty and he gave me drink I was a stranger and he took me in lived in a neater house dined at a better table took paid for and read more newspapers better understood the moral religious and political character of the nation--than nine tenths of the slaveholders in Talbot county Maryland Yet Mr Johnson was a working man His hands were hardened by toil and not his alone but those also of Mrs Johnson I found the colored people much more spirited than I had supposed they would be I found among them a determination to protect each other from the blood-thirsty kidnapper at all hazards Soon after my arrival I was told of a circumstance which illustrated their spirit A colored man and a fugitive slave were on unfriendly terms The former was heard to threaten the latter with informing his master of his whereabouts Straightway a meeting was called among the colored people under the stereotyped notice Business of importance The betrayer was invited to attend The people came at the appointed hour and organized the meeting by appointing a very religious old gentleman as president who I believe made a prayer after which he addressed the meeting as follows Friends we have got him here and I would recommend that you young men just take him outside the door and kill him With this a number of them bolted at him but they were intercepted by some more timid than themselves and the betrayer escaped their vengeance and has not been seen in New Bedford since I believe there have been no more such threats and should there be hereafter I doubt not that death would be the consequence I found employment the third day after my arrival in stowing a sloop with a load of oil It was new dirty and hard work for me but I went at it with a glad heart and a willing hand I was now my own master It was a happy moment the rapture of which can be understood only by those who have been slaves It was the first work the reward of which was to be entirely my own There was no Master Hugh standing ready the moment I earned the money to rob me of it I worked that day with a pleasure I had never before experienced I was at work for myself and newly-married wife It was to me the starting-point of a new existence When I got through with that job I went in pursuit of a job of calking but such was the strength of prejudice against color among the white calkers that they refused to work with me and of course I could get no employment Finding my trade of no immediate benefit I threw off my calking habiliments and prepared myself to do any kind of work I could get to do Mr Johnson kindly let me have his wood-horse and saw and I very soon found myself a plenty of work There was no work too hard--none too dirty I was ready to saw wood shovel coal carry the hod sweep the chimney or roll oil casks--all of which I did for nearly three years in New Bedford before I became known to the anti-slavery world In about four months after I went to New Bedford there came a young man to me and inquired if I did not wish to take the Liberator I told him I did but just having made my escape from slavery I remarked that I was unable to pay for it then I however finally became a subscriber to it The paper came and I read it from week to week with such I am told that colored persons can now get employment at calking in New Bedford--a result of anti-slavery effort feelings as it would be quite idle for me to attempt to describe The paper became my meat and my drink My soul was set all on fire Its sympathy for my brethren in bonds--its scathing denunciations of slaveholders--its faithful exposures of slavery--and its powerful attacks upon the upholders of the institution--sent a thrill of joy through my soul such as I had never felt before I had not long been a reader of the Liberator before I got a pretty correct idea of the principles measures and spirit of the anti-slavery reform I took right hold of the cause I could do but little but what I could I did with a joyful heart and never felt happier than when in an anti-slavery meeting I seldom had much to say at the meetings because what I wanted to say was said so much better by others But while attending an anti-slavery convention at Nantucket on the th of August I felt strongly moved to speak and was at the same time much urged to do so by Mr William C Coffin a gentleman who had heard me speak in the colored people's meeting at New Bedford It was a severe cross and I took it up reluctantly The truth was I felt myself a slave and the idea of speaking to white people weighed me down I spoke but a few moments when I felt a degree of freedom and said what I desired with considerable ease From that time until now I have been engaged in pleading the cause of my brethren--with what success and with what devotion I leave those acquainted with my labors to decide APPENDIX I FIND since reading over the foregoing Narrative that I have in several instances spoken in such a tone and manner respecting religion as may possibly lead those unacquainted with my religious views to suppose me an opponent of all religion To remove the liability of such misapprehension I deem it proper to append the following brief explanation What I have said respecting and against religion I mean strictly to apply to the slaveholding religion of this land and with no possible reference to Christianity proper for between the Christianity of this land and the Christianity of Christ I recognize the widest possible difference--so wide that to receive the one as good pure and holy is of necessity to reject the other as bad corrupt and wicked To be the friend of the one is of necessity to be the enemy of the other I love the pure peaceable and impartial Christianity of Christ I therefore hate the corrupt slaveholding women-whipping cradle-plundering partial and hypocritical Christianity of this land Indeed I can see no reason but the most deceitful one for calling the religion of this land Christianity I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers the boldest of all frauds and the grossest of all libels Never was there a clearer case of stealing the livery of the court of heaven to serve the devil in I am filled with unutterable loathing when I contemplate the religious pomp and show together with the horrible inconsistencies which every where surround me We have men-stealers for ministers women-whippers for missionaries and cradle-plunderers for church members The man who wields the blood-clotted cowskin during the week fills the pulpit on Sunday and claims to be a minister of the meek and lowly Jesus The man who robs me of my earnings at the end of each week meets me as a class-leader on Sunday morning to show me the way of life and the path of salvation He who sells my sister for purposes of prostitution stands forth as the pious advocate of purity He who proclaims it a religious duty to read the Bible denies me the right of learning to read the name of the God who made me He who is the religious advocate of marriage robs whole millions of its sacred influence and leaves them to the ravages of wholesale pollution The warm defender of the sacredness of the family relation is the same that scatters whole families-- sundering husbands and wives parents and children sisters and brothers leaving the hut vacant and the hearth desolate We see the thief preaching against theft and the adulterer against adultery We have men sold to build churches women sold to support the gospel and babes sold to purchase Bibles for the poor heathen all for the glory of God and the good of souls The slave auctioneer's bell and the church-going bell chime in with each other and the bitter cries of the heart-broken slave are drowned in the religious shouts of his pious master Revivals of religion and revivals in the slave-trade go hand in hand together The slave prison and the church stand near each other The clanking of fetters and the rattling of chains in the prison and the pious psalm and solemn prayer in the church may be heard at the same time The dealers in the bodies and souls of men erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit and they mutually help each other The dealer gives his blood-stained gold to support the pulpit and the pulpit in return covers his infernal business with the garb of Christianity Here we have religion and robbery the allies of each other--devils dressed in angels' robes and hell presenting the semblance of paradise Just God and these are they Who minister at thine altar God of right Men who their hands with prayer and blessing lay On Israel's ark of light What preach and kidnap men Give thanks and rob thy own afflicted poor Talk of thy glorious liberty and then Bolt hard the captive's door What servants of thy own Merciful Son who came to seek and save The homeless and the outcast fettering down The tasked and plundered slave Pilate and Herod friends Chief priests and rulers as of old combine Just God and holy is that church which lends Strength to the spoiler thine The Christianity of America is a Christianity of whose votaries it may be as truly said as it was of the ancient scribes and Pharisees They bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers All their works they do for to be seen of men-- They love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues and to be called of men Rabbi Rabbi--But woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in Ye devour widows' houses and for a pretence make long prayers therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves--Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone Ye blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess--Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity Dark and terrible as is this picture I hold it to be strictly true of the overwhelming mass of professed Christians in America They strain at a gnat and swallow a camel Could any thing be more true of our churches They would be shocked at the proposition of fellowshipping a sheep-stealer and at the same time they hug to their communion a man-stealer and brand me with being an infidel if I find fault with them for it They attend with Pharisaical strictness to the outward forms of religion and at the same time neglect the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith They are always ready to sacrifice but seldom to show mercy They are they who are represented as professing to love God whom they have not seen whilst they hate their brother whom they have seen They love the heathen on the other side of the globe They can pray for him pay money to have the Bible put into his hand and missionaries to instruct him while they despise and totally neglect the heathen at their own doors Such is very briefly my view of the religion of this land and to avoid any misunderstanding growing out of the use of general terms I mean by the religion of this land that which is revealed in the words deeds and actions of those bodies north and south calling themselves Christian churches and yet in union with slaveholders It is against religion as presented by these bodies that I have felt it my duty to testify I conclude these remarks by copying the following portrait of the religion of the south which is by communion and fellowship the religion of the north which I soberly affirm is true to the life and without caricature or the slightest exaggeration It is said to have been drawn several years before the present anti-slavery agitation began by a northern Methodist preacher who while residing at the south had an opportunity to see slaveholding morals manners and piety with his own eyes Shall I not visit for these things saith the Lord Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this A PARODY Come saints and sinners hear me tell How pious priests whip Jack and Nell And women buy and children sell And preach all sinners down to hell And sing of heavenly union They'll bleat and baa dona like goats Gorge down black sheep and strain at motes Array their backs in fine black coats Then seize their negroes by their throats And choke for heavenly union They'll church you if you sip a dram And damn you if you steal a lamb Yet rob old Tony Doll and Sam Of human rights and bread and ham Kidnapper's heavenly union They'll loudly talk of Christ's reward And bind his image with a cord And scold and swing the lash abhorred And sell their brother in the Lord To handcuffed heavenly union They'll read and sing a sacred song And make a prayer both loud and long And teach the right and do the wrong Hailing the brother sister throng With words of heavenly union We wonder how such saints can sing Or praise the Lord upon the wing Who roar and scold and whip and sting And to their slaves and mammon cling In guilty conscience union They'll raise tobacco corn and rye And drive and thieve and cheat and lie And lay up treasures in the sky By making switch and cowskin fly In hope of heavenly union They'll crack old Tony on the skull And preach and roar like Bashan bull Or braying ass of mischief full Then seize old Jacob by the wool And pull for heavenly union A roaring ranting sleek man-thief Who lived on mutton veal and beef Yet never would afford relief To needy sable sons of grief Was big with heavenly union 'Love not the world' the preacher said And winked his eye and shook his head He seized on Tom and Dick and Ned Cut short their meat and clothes and bread Yet still loved heavenly union Another preacher whining spoke Of One whose heart for sinners broke He tied old Nanny to an oak And drew the blood at every stroke And prayed for heavenly union Two others oped their iron jaws And waved their children-stealing paws There sat their children in gewgaws By stinting negroes' backs and maws They kept up heavenly union All good from Jack another takes And entertains their flirts and rakes Who dress as sleek as glossy snakes And cram their mouths with sweetened cakes And this goes down for union Sincerely and earnestly hoping that this little book may do something toward throwing light on the American slave system and hastening the glad day of deliverance to the millions of my brethren in bonds--faithfully relying upon the power of truth love and justice for success in my humble efforts--and solemnly pledging my self anew to the sacred cause--I subscribe myself FREDERICK DOUGLASS LYNN Mass April THE END
Harriet,INCIDENTS IN THE LIFE OF A SLAVE GIRL WRITTEN BY HERSELF Northerners know nothing at all about Slavery They think it is perpetual bondage only They have no conception of the depth of degradation involved in that word SLAVERY if they had they would never cease their efforts until so horrible a system was overthrown A WOMAN OF NORTH CAROLINA Rise up ye women that are at ease Hear my voice ye careless daughters Give ear unto my speech ISAIAH xxxii EDITED BY L MARIA CHILD BOSTON PUBLISHED FOR THE AUTHOR Entered according to Act of Congress in the year by L MARIA CHILD In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR READER be assured this narrative is no fiction I am aware that some of my adventures may seem incredible but they are nevertheless strictly true I have not exaggerated the wrongs inflicted by Slavery on the contrary my descriptions fall far short of the facts I have concealed the names of places and given persons fictitious names I had no motive for secrecy on my own account but I deemed it kind and considerate towards others to pursue this course I wish I were more competent to the task I have undertaken But I trust my readers will excuse deficiencies in consideration of circumstances I was born and reared in Slavery and I remained in a Slave State twenty-seven years Since I have been at the North it has been necessary for me to work diligently for my own support and the education of my children This has not left me much leisure to make up for the loss of early opportunities to improve myself and it has compelled me to write these s at irregular intervals whenever I could snatch an hour from household duties When I first arrived in Philadelphia Bishop Paine advised me to publish a sketch of my life but I told him I was altogether incompetent to such an undertaking Though I have improved my mind somewhat since that time I still remain of the same opinion but I trust my motives will excuse what might otherwise seem presumptuous I have not written my experiences in order to attract attention to myself on the contrary it would have been more pleasant to me to have been silent about my own history Neither do I care to excite sympathy for my own sufferings But I do earnestly desire to arouse the women of the North to a realizing sense of the condition of two millions of women at the South still in bondage suffering what I suffered and most of them far worse I want to add my testimony to that of abler pens to convince the people of the Free States what Slavery really is Only by experience can any one realize how deep and dark and foul is that pit of abominations May the blessing of God rest on this imperfect effort in behalf of my persecuted people LINDA BRENT INTRODUCTION BY THE EDITOR THE author of the following autobiography is personally known to me and her conversation and manners inspire me with confidence During the last seventeen years she has lived the greater part of the time with a distinguished family in New York and has so deported herself as to be highly esteemed by them This fact is sufficient without further credentials of her character I believe those who know her will not be disposed to doubt her veracity though some incidents in her story are more romantic than fiction At her request I have revised her manuscript but such changes as I have made have been mainly for purposes of condensation and orderly arrangement I have not added any thing to the incidents or changed the import of her very pertinent remarks With trifling exceptions both the ideas and the language are her own I pruned excrescences a little but otherwise I had no reason for changing her lively and dramatic way of telling her own story The names of both persons and places are known to me but for good reasons I suppress them It will naturally excite surprise that a woman reared in Slavery should be able to write so well But circumstances will explain this In the first place nature endowed her with quick perceptions Secondly the mistress with whom she lived till she was twelve years old was a kind considerate friend who taught her to read and spell Thirdly she was placed in favorable circumstances after she came to the North having frequent intercourse with intelligent persons who felt a friendly interest in her welfare and were disposed to give her opportunities for self-improvement I am well aware that many will accuse me of indecorum for presenting these s to the public for the experiences of this intelligent and much-injured woman belong to a class which some call delicate subjects and others indelicate This peculiar phase of Slavery has generally been kept veiled but the public ought to be made acquainted with its monstrous features and I willingly take the responsibility of presenting them with the veil withdrawn I do this for the sake of my sisters in bondage who are suffering wrongs so foul that our ears are too delicate to listen to them I do it with the hope of arousing conscientious and reflecting women at the North to a sense of their duty in the exertion of moral influence on the question of Slavery on all possible occasions I do it with the hope that every man who reads this narrative will swear solemnly before God that so far as he has power to prevent it no fugitive from Slavery shall ever be sent back to suffer in that loathsome den of corruption and cruelty L MARIA CHILD CONTENTS CHILDHOOD THE NEW MASTER AND MISTRESS THE SLAVES' NEW YEAR'S DAY THE SLAVE WHO DARED TO FEEL LIKE A

THE CONFESSION THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW FREE AT LAST APPENDIX INCIDENTS IN THE LIFE OF A SLAVE GIRL SEVEN YEARS CONCEALED I CHILDHOOD I WAS born a slave but I never knew it till six years of happy childhood had passed away My father was a carpenter and considered so intelligent and skilful in his trade that when buildings out of the common line were to be erected he was sent for from long distances to be head workman On condition of paying his mistress two hundred dollars a year and supporting himself he was allowed to work at his trade and manage his own affairs His strongest wish was to purchase his children but though he several times offered his hard earnings for that purpose he never succeeded In complexion my parents were a light shade of brownish yellow and were termed mulattoes They lived together in a comfortable home and though we were all slaves I was so fondly shielded that I never dreamed I was a piece of merchandise trusted to them for safe keeping and liable to be demanded of them at any moment I had one brother William who was two years younger than myselfa bright affectionate child I had also a great treasure in my maternal grandmother who was a remarkable woman in many respects She was the daughter of a planter in South Carolina who at his death left her mother and his three children free with money to go to St Augustine where they had relatives It was during the Revolutionary War and they were captured on their passage carried back and sold to different purchasers Such was the story my grandmother used to tell me but I do not remember all the particulars She was a little girl when she was captured and sold to the keeper of a large hotel I have often heard her tell how hard she fared during childhood But as she grew older she evinced so much intelligence and was so faithful that her master and mistress could not help seeing it was for their interest to take care of such a valuable piece of property She became an indispensable personage in the household officiating in all capacities from cook and wet nurse to seamstress She was much praised for her cooking and her nice crackers became so famous in the neighborhood that many people were desirous of obtaining them In consequence of numerous requests of this kind she asked permission of her mistress to bake crackers at night after all the household work was done and she obtained leave to do it provided she would clothe herself and her children from the profits Upon these terms after working hard all day for her mistress she began her midnight bakings assisted by her two oldest children The business proved profitable and each year she laid by a little which was saved for a fund to purchase her children Her master died and the property was divided among his heirs The widow had her dower in the hotel which she continued to keep open My grandmother remained in her service as a slave but her children were divided among her master's children As she had five Benjamin the youngest one was sold in order that each heir might have an equal portion of dollars and cents There was so little difference in our ages that he seemed more like my brother than my uncle He was a bright handsome lad nearly white for he inherited the complexion my grandmother had derived from Anglo-Saxon ancestors Though only ten years old seven hundred and twenty dollars were paid for him His sale was a terrible blow to my grandmother but she was naturally hopeful and she went to work with renewed energy trusting in time to be able to purchase some of her children She had laid up three hundred dollars which her mistress one day begged as a loan promising to pay her soon The reader probably knows that no promise or writing given to a slave is legally binding for according to Southern laws a slave being property can hold no property When my grandmother lent her hard earnings to her mistress she trusted solely to her honor The honor of a slaveholder to a slave To this good grandmother I was indebted for many comforts My brother Willie and I often received portions of the crackers cakes and preserves she made to sell and after we ceased to be children we were indebted to her for many more important services Such were the unusually fortunate circumstances of my early childhood When I was six years old my mother died and then for the first time I learned by the talk around me that I was a slave My mother's mistress was the daughter of my grandmother's mistress She was the foster sister of my mother they were both nourished at my grandmother's breast In fact my mother had been weaned at three months old that the babe of the mistress might obtain sufficient food They played together as children and when they became women my mother was a most faithful servant to her whiter foster sister On her death-bed her mistress promised that her children should never suffer for any thing and during her lifetime she kept her word They all spoke kindly of my dead mother who had been a slave merely in name but in nature was noble and womanly I grieved for her and my young mind was troubled with the thought who would now take care of me and my little brother I was told that my home was now to be with her mistress and I found it a happy one No toilsome or disagreeable duties were imposed upon me My mistress was so kind to me that I was always glad to do her bidding and proud to labor for her as much as my young years would permit I would sit by her side for hours sewing diligently with a heart as free from care as that of any free-born white child When she thought I was tired she would send me out to run and jump and away I bounded to gather berries or flowers to decorate her room Those were happy daystoo happy to last The slave child had no thought for the morrow but there came that blight which too surely waits on every human being born to be a chattel When I was nearly twelve years old my kind mistress sickened and died As I saw the cheek grow paler and the eye more glassy how earnestly I prayed in my heart that she might live I loved her for she had been almost like a mother to me My prayers were not answered She died and they buried her in the little churchyard where day after day my tears fell upon her grave I was sent to spend a week with my grandmother I was now old enough to begin to think of the future and again and again I asked myself what they would do with me I felt sure I should never find another mistress so kind as the one who was gone She had promised my dying mother that her children should never suffer for any thing and when I remembered that and recalled her many proofs of attachment to me I could not help having some hopes that she had left me free My friends were almost certain it would be so They thought she would be sure to do it on account of my mother's love and faithful service But alas we all know that the memory of a faithful slave does not avail much to save her children from the auction block After a brief period of suspense the will of my mistress was read and we learned that she had bequeathed me to her sister's daughter a child of five years old So vanished our hopes My mistress had taught me the precepts of God's Word Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you do ye even so unto them But I was her slave and I suppose she did not recognize me as her neighbor I would give much to blot out from my memory that one great wrong As a child I loved my mistress and looking back on the happy days I spent with her I try to think with less bitterness of this act of injustice While I was with her she taught me to read and spell and for this privilege which so rarely falls to the lot of a slave I bless her memory She possessed but few slaves and at her death those were all distributed among her relatives Five of them were my grandmother's children and had shared the same milk that nourished her mother's children Notwithstanding my grandmother's long and faithful service to her owners not one of her children escaped the auction block These God-breathing machines are no more in the sight of their masters than the cotton they plant or the horses they tend II THE NEW MASTER AND MISTRESS DR FLINT a physician in the neighborhood had married the sister of my mistress and I was now the property of their little daughter It was not without murmuring that I prepared for my new home and what added to my unhappiness was the fact that my brother William was purchased by the same family My father by his nature as well as by the habit of transacting business as a skilful mechanic had more of the feelings of a freeman than is common among slaves My brother was a spirited boy and being brought up under such influences he early detested the name of master and mistress One day when his father and his mistress both happened to call him at the same time he hesitated between the two being perplexed to know which had the strongest claim upon his obedience He finally concluded to go to his mistress When my father reproved him for it he said You both called me and I didn't know which I ought to go to first You are my child replied our father and when I call you you should come immediately if you have to pass through fire and water Poor Willie He was now to learn his first lesson of obedience to a master Grandmother tried to cheer us with hopeful words and they found an echo in the credulous hearts of youth When we entered our new home we encountered cold looks cold words and cold treatment We were glad when the night came On my narrow bed I moaned and wept I felt so desolate and alone I had been there nearly a year when a dear little friend of mine was buried I heard her mother sob as the clods fell on the coffin of her only child and I turned away from the grave feeling thankful that I still had something left to love I met my grandmother who said Come with me Linda and from her tone I knew that something sad had happened She led me apart from the people and then said My child your father is dead Dead How could I believe it He had died so suddenly I had not even heard that he was sick I went home with my grandmother My heart rebelled against God who had taken from me mother father mistress and friend The good grandmother tried to comfort me Who knows the ways of God said she Perhaps they have been kindly taken from the evil days to come Years afterwards I often thought of this She promised to be a mother to her grandchildren so far as she might be permitted to do so and strengthened by her love I returned to my master's I thought I should be allowed to go to my father's house the next morning but I was ordered to go for flowers that my mistress's house might be decorated for an evening party I spent the day gathering flowers and weaving them into festoons while the dead body of my father was lying within a mile of me What cared my owners for that he was merely a piece of property Moreover they thought he had spoiled his children by teaching them to feel that they were human beings This was blasphemous doctrine for a slave to teach presumptuous in him and dangerous to the masters The next day I followed his remains to a humble grave beside that of my dear mother There were those who knew my father's worth and respected his memory My home now seemed more dreary than ever The laugh of the little slave-children sounded harsh and cruel It was selfish to feel so about the joy of others My brother moved about with a very grave face I tried to comfort him by saying Take courage Willie brighter days will come by and by You don't know any thing about it Linda he replied We shall have to stay here all our days we shall never be free I argued that we were growing older and stronger and that perhaps we might before long be allowed to hire our own time and then we could earn money to buy our freedom William declared this was much easier to say than to do moreover he did not intend to buy his freedom We held daily controversies upon this subject Little attention was paid to the slaves' meals in Dr Flint's house If they could catch a bit of food while it was going well and good I gave myself no trouble on that score for on my various errands I passed my grandmother's house where there was always something to spare for me I was frequently threatened with punishment if I stopped there and my grandmother to avoid detaining me often stood at the gate with something for my breakfast or dinner I was indebted to her for all my comforts spiritual or temporal It was her labor that supplied my scanty wardrobe I have a vivid recollection of the linsey-woolsey dress given me every winter by Mrs Flint How I hated it It was one of the badges of slavery While my grandmother was thus helping to support me from her hard earnings the three hundred dollars she had lent her mistress were never repaid When her mistress died her son-in-law Dr Flint was appointed executor When grandmother applied to him for payment he said the estate was insolvent and the law prohibited payment It did not however prohibit him from retaining the silver candelabra which had been purchased with that money I presume they will be handed down in the family from generation to generation My grandmother's mistress had always promised her that at her death she should be free and it was said that in her will she made good the promise But when the estate was settled Dr Flint told the faithful old servant that under existing circumstances it was necessary she should be sold On the appointed day the customary advertisement was posted up proclaiming that there would be a public sale of negroes horses c Dr Flint called to tell my grandmother that he was unwilling to wound her feelings by putting her up at auction and that he would prefer to dispose of her at private sale My grandmother saw through his hypocrisy she understood very well that he was ashamed of the job She was a very spirited woman and if he was base enough to sell her when her mistress intended she should be free she was determined the public should know it She had for a long time supplied many families with crackers and preserves consequently Aunt Marthy as she was called was generally known and every body who knew her respected her intelligence and good character Her long and faithful service in the family was also well known and the intention of her mistress to leave her free When the day of sale came she took her place among the chattels and at the first call she sprang upon the auction-block Many voices called out Shame Shame Who is going to sell you aunt Marthy Don't stand there That is no place for you Without saying a word she quietly awaited her fate No one bid for her At last a feeble voice said Fifty dollars It came from a maiden lady seventy years old the sister of my grandmother's deceased mistress She had lived forty years under the same roof with my grandmother she knew how faithfully she had served her owners and how cruelly she had been defrauded of her rights and she resolved to protect her The auctioneer waited for a higher bid but her wishes were respected no one bid above her She could neither read nor write and when the bill of sale was made out she signed it with a cross But what consequence was that when she had a big heart overflowing with human kindness She gave the old servant her freedom At that time my grandmother was just fifty years old Laborious years had passed since then and now my brother and I were slaves to the man who had defrauded her of her money and tried to defraud her of her freedom One of my mother's sisters called Aunt Nancy was also a slave in his family She was a kind good aunt to me and supplied the place of both housekeeper and waiting maid to her mistress She was in fact at the beginning and end of every thing Mrs Flint like many southern women was totally deficient in energy She had not strength to superintend her household affairs but her nerves were so strong that she could sit in her easy chair and see a woman whipped till the blood trickled from every stroke of the lash She was a member of the church but partaking of the Lord's supper did not seem to put her in a Christian frame of mind If dinner was not served at the exact time on that particular Sunday she would station herself in the kitchen and wait till it was dished and then spit in all the kettles and pans that had been used for cooking She did this to prevent the cook and her children from eking out their meagre fare with the remains of the gravy and other scrapings The slaves could get nothing to eat except what she chose to give them Provisions were weighed out by the pound and ounce three times a day I can assure you she gave them no chance to eat wheat bread from her flour barrel She knew how many biscuits a quart of flour would make and exactly what size they ought to be Dr Flint was an epicure The cook never sent a dinner to his table without fear and trembling for if there happened to be a dish not to his liking he would either order her to be whipped or compel her to eat every mouthful of it in his presence The poor hungry creature might not have objected to eating it but she did object to having her master cram it down her throat till she choked They had a pet dog that was a nuisance in the house The cook was ordered to make some Indian mush for him He refused to eat and when his head was held over it the froth flowed from his mouth into the basin He died a few minutes after When Dr Flint came in he said the mush had not been well cooked and that was the reason the animal would not eat it He sent for the cook and compelled her to eat it He thought that the woman's stomach was stronger than the dog's but her sufferings afterwards proved that he was mistaken This poor woman endured many cruelties from her master and mistress sometimes she was locked up away from her nursing baby for a whole day and night When I had been in the family a few weeks one of the plantation slaves was brought to town by order of his master It was near night when he arrived and Dr Flint ordered him to be taken to the work house and tied up to the joist so that his feet would just escape the ground In that situation he was to wait till the doctor had taken his tea I shall never forget that night Never before in my life had I heard hundreds of blows fall in succession on a human being His piteous groans and his O pray don't massa rang in my ear for months afterwards There were many conjectures as to the cause of this terrible punishment Some said master accused him of stealing corn others said the slave had quarrelled with his wife in presence of the overseer and had accused his master of being the father of her child They were both black and the child was very fair I went into the work house next morning and saw the cowhide still wet with blood and the boards all covered with gore The poor man lived and continued to quarrel with his wife A few months afterwards Dr Flint handed them both over to a slave-trader The guilty man put their value into his pocket and had the satisfaction of knowing that they were out of sight and hearing When the mother was delivered into the trader's hands she said You promised to treat me well To which he replied You have let your tongue run too far damn you She had forgotten that it was a crime for a slave to tell who was the father of her child From others than the master persecution also comes in such cases I once saw a young slave girl dying soon after the birth of a child nearly white In her agony she cried out O Lord come and take me Her mistress stood by and mocked at her like an incarnate fiend You suffer do you she exclaimed I am glad of it You deserve it all and more too The girl's mother said The baby is dead thank God and I hope my poor child will soon be in heaven too Heaven retorted the mistress There is no such place for the like of her and her bastard The poor mother turned away sobbing Her dying daughter called her feebly and as she bent over her I heard her say Don't grieve so mother God knows all about it and HE will have mercy upon me Her sufferings afterwards became so intense that her mistress felt unable to stay but when she left the room the scornful smile was still on her lips Seven children called her mother The poor black woman had but the one child whose eyes she saw closing in death while she thanked God for taking her away from the greater bitterness of life III THE SLAVES' NEW YEAR'S DAY DR FLINT owned a fine residence in town several farms and about fifty slaves besides hiring a number by the year Hiring-day at the south takes place on the st of January On the d the slaves are expected to go to their new masters On a farm they work until the corn and cotton are laid They then have two holidays Some masters give them a good dinner under the trees This over they work until Christmas eve If no heavy charges are meantime brought against them they are given four or five holidays whichever the master or overseer may think proper Then comes New Year's eve and they gather together their little alls or more properly speaking their little nothings and wait anxiously for the dawning of day At the appointed hour the grounds are thronged with men women and children waiting like criminals to hear their doom pronounced The slave is sure to know who is the most humane or cruel master within forty miles of him It is easy to find out on that day who clothes and feeds his slaves well for he is surrounded by a crowd begging Please massa hire me this year I will work very hard massa If a slave is unwilling to go with his new master he is whipped or locked up in jail until he consents to go and promises not to run away during the year Should he chance to change his mind thinking it justifiable to violate an extorted promise woe unto him if he is caught The whip is used till the blood flows at his feet and his stiffened limbs are put in chains to be dragged in the field for days and days If he lives until the next year perhaps the same man will hire him again without even giving him an opportunity of going to the hiring-ground After those for hire are disposed of those for sale are called up O you happy free women contrast your New Year's day with that of the poor bond-woman With you it is a pleasant season and the light of the day is blessed Friendly wishes meet you every where and gifts are showered upon you Even hearts that have been estranged from you soften at this season and lips that have been silent echo back I wish you a happy New Year Children bring their little offerings and raise their rosy lips for a caress They are your own and no hand but that of death can take them from you But to the slave mother New Year's day comes laden with peculiar sorrows She sits on her cold cabin floor watching the children who may all be torn from her the next morning and often does she wish that she and they might die before the day dawns She may be an ignorant creature degraded by the system that has brutalized her from childhood but she has a mother's instincts and is capable of feeling a mother's agonies On one of these sale days I saw a mother lead seven children to the auction-block She knew that some of them would be taken from her but they took all The children were sold to a slave-trader and their mother was bought by a man in her own town Before night her children were all far away She begged the trader to tell her where he intended to take them this he refused to do How could he when he knew he would sell them one by one wherever he could command the highest price I met that mother in the street and her wild haggard face lives to-day in my mind She wrung her hands in anguish and exclaimed Gone All gone Why don't God kill me I had no words wherewith to comfort her Instances of this kind are of daily yea of hourly occurrence Slaveholders have a method peculiar to their institution of getting rid of old slaves whose lives have been worn out in their service I knew an old woman who for seventy years faithfully served her master She had become almost helpless from hard labor and disease Her owners moved to Alabama and the old black woman was left to be sold to any body who would give twenty dollars for her IV THE SLAVE WHO DARED TO FEEL LIKE A MAN TWO years had passed since I entered Dr Flint's family and those years had brought much of the knowledge that comes from experience though they had afforded little opportunity for any other kinds of knowledge My grandmother had as much as possible been a mother to her orphan grandchildren By perseverance and unwearied industry she was now mistress of a snug little home surrounded with the necessaries of life She would have been happy could her children have shared them with her There remained but three children and two grandchildren all slaves Most earnestly did she strive to make us feel that it was the will of God that He had seen fit to place us under such circumstances and though it seemed hard we ought to pray for contentment It was a beautiful faith coming from a mother who could not call her children her own But I and Benjamin her youngest boy condemned it We reasoned that it was much more the will of God that we should be situated as she was We longed for a home like hers There we always found sweet balsam for our troubles She was so loving so sympathizing She always met us with a smile and listened with patience to all our sorrows She spoke so hopefully that unconsciously the clouds gave place to sunshine There was a grand big oven there too that baked bread and nice things for the town and we knew there was always a choice bit in store for us But alas even the charms of the old oven failed to reconcile us to our hard lot Benjamin was now a tall handsome lad strongly and gracefully made and with a spirit too bold and daring for a slave My brother William now twelve years old had the same aversion to the word master that he had when he was an urchin of seven years I was his confidant He came to me with all his troubles I remember one instance in particular It was on a lovely spring morning and when I marked the sunlight dancing here and there its beauty seemed to mock my sadness For my master whose restless craving vicious nature roved about day and night seeking whom to devour had just left me with stinging scorching words words that scathed ear and brain like fire O how I despised him I thought how glad I should be if some day when he walked the earth it would open and swallow him up and disencumber the world of a plague When he told me that I was made for his use made to obey his command in every thing that I was nothing but a slave whose will must and should surrender to his never before had my puny arm felt half so strong So deeply was I absorbed in painful reflections afterwards that I neither saw nor heard the entrance of any one till the voice of William sounded close beside me Linda said he what makes you look so sad I love you O Linda isn't this a bad world Every body seems so cross and unhappy I wish I had died when poor father did I told him that every body was not cross or unhappy that those who had pleasant homes and kind friends and who were not afraid to love them were happy But we who were slave-children without father or mother could not expect to be happy We must be good perhaps that would bring us contentment Yes he said I try to be good but what's the use They are all the time troubling me Then he proceeded to relate his afternoon's difficulty with young master Nicholas It seemed that the brother of master Nicholas had pleased himself with making up stories about William Master Nicholas said he should be flogged and he would do it Whereupon he went to work but William fought bravely and the young master finding he was getting the better of him undertook to tie his hands behind him He failed in that likewise By dint of kicking and fisting William came out of the skirmish none the worse for a few scratches He continued to discourse on his young master's meanness how he whipped the little boys but was a perfect coward when a tussle ensued between him and white boys of his own size On such occasions he always took to his legs William had other charges to make against him One was his rubbing up pennies with quicksilver and passing them off for quarters of a dollar on an old man who kept a fruit stall William was often sent to buy fruit and he earnestly inquired of me what he ought to do under such circumstances I told him it was certainly wrong to deceive the old man and that it was his duty to tell him of the impositions practised by his young master I assured him the old man would not be slow to comprehend the whole and there the matter would end William thought it might with the old man but not with him He said he did not mind the smart of the whip but he did not like the idea of being whipped While I advised him to be good and forgiving I was not unconscious of the beam in my own eye It was the very knowledge of my own shortcomings that urged me to retain if possible some sparks of my brother's God-given nature I had not lived fourteen years in slavery for nothing I had felt seen and heard enough to read the characters and question the motives of those around me The war of my life had begun and though one of God's most powerless creatures I resolved never to be conquered Alas for me If there was one pure sunny spot for me I believed it to be in Benjamin's heart and in another's whom I loved with all the ardor of a girl's first love My owner knew of it and sought in every way to render me miserable He did not resort to corporal punishment but to all the petty tyrannical ways that human ingenuity could devise I remember the first time I was punished It was in the month of February My grandmother had taken my old shoes and replaced them with a new pair I needed them for several inches of snow had fallen and it still continued to fall When I walked through Mrs Flint's room their creaking grated harshly on her refined nerves She called me to her and asked what I had about me that made such a horrid noise I told her it was my new shoes Take them off said she and if you put them on again I'll throw them into the fire I took them off and my stockings also She then sent me a long distance on an errand As I went through the snow my bare feet tingled That night I was very hoarse and I went to bed thinking the next day would find me sick perhaps dead What was my grief on waking to find myself quite well I had imagined if I died or was laid up for some time that my mistress would feel a twinge of remorse that she had so hated the little imp as she styled me It was my ignorance of that mistress that gave rise to such extravagant imaginings Dr Flint occasionally had high prices offered for me but he always said She don't belong to me She is my daughter's property and I have no right to sell her Good honest man My young mistress was still a child and I could look for no protection from her I loved her and she returned my affection I once heard her father allude to her attachment to me and his wife promptly replied that it proceeded from fear This put unpleasant doubts into my mind Did the child feign what she did not feel or was her mother jealous of the mite of love she bestowed on me I concluded it must be the latter I said to myself Surely little children are true One afternoon I sat at my sewing feeling unusual depression of spirits My mistress had been accusing me of an offence of which I assured her I was perfectly innocent but I saw by the contemptuous curl of her lip that she believed I was telling a lie I wondered for what wise purpose God was leading me through such thorny paths and whether still darker days were in store for me As I sat musing thus the door opened softly and William came in Well brother said I what is the matter this time O Linda Ben and his master have had a dreadful time said he My first thought was that Benjamin was killed Don't be frightened Linda said William I will tell you all about it It appeared that Benjamin's master had sent for him and he did not immediately obey the summons When he did his master was angry and began to whip him He resisted Master and slave fought and finally the master was thrown Benjamin had cause to tremble for he had thrown to the ground his masterone of the richest men in town I anxiously awaited the result That night I stole to my grandmother's house and Benjamin also stole thither from his master's My grandmother had gone to spend a day or two with an old friend living in the country I have come said Benjamin to tell you good by I am going away I inquired where To the north he replied I looked at him to see whether he was in earnest I saw it all in his firm set mouth I implored him not to go but he paid no heed to my words He said he was no longer a boy and every day made his yoke more galling He had raised his hand against his master and was to be publicly whipped for the offence I reminded him of the poverty and hardships he must encounter among strangers I told him he might be caught and brought back and that was terrible to think of He grew vexed and asked if poverty and hardships with freedom were not preferable to our treatment in slavery Linda he continued we are dogs here foot-balls cattle every thing that's mean No I will not stay Let them bring me back We don't die but once He was right but it was hard to give him up Go said I and break your mother's heart I repented of my words ere they were out Linda said he speaking as I had not heard him speak that evening how could you say that Poor mother be kind to her Linda and you too cousin Fanny Cousin Fanny was a friend who had lived some years with us Farewells were exchanged and the bright kind boy endeared to us by so many acts of love vanished from our sight It is not necessary to state how he made his escape Suffice it to say he was on his way to New York when a violent storm overtook the vessel The captain said he must put into the nearest port This alarmed Benjamin who was aware that he would be advertised in every port near his own town His embarrassment was noticed by the captain To port they went There the advertisement met the captain's eye Benjamin so exactly answered its description that the captain laid hold on him and bound him in chains The storm passed and they proceeded to New York Before reaching that port Benjamin managed to get off his chains and throw them overboard He escaped from the vessel but was pursued captured and carried back to his master When my grandmother returned home and found her youngest child had fled great was her sorrow but with characteristic piety she said God's will be done Each morning she inquired if any news had been heard from her boy Yes news was heard The master was rejoicing over a letter announcing the capture of his human chattel That day seems but as yesterday so well do I remember it I saw him led through the streets in chains to jail His face was ghastly pale yet full of determination He had begged one of the sailors to go to his mother's house and ask her not to meet him He said the sight of her distress would take from him all self-control She yearned to see him and she went but she screened herself in the crowd that it might be as her child had said We were not allowed to visit him but we had known the jailer for years and he was a kind-hearted man At midnight he opened the jail door for my grandmother and myself to enter in disguise When we entered the cell not a sound broke the stillness Benjamin Benjamin whispered my grandmother No answer Benjamin she again faltered There was a jingle of chains The moon had just risen and cast an uncertain light through the bars of the window We knelt down and took Benjamin's cold hands in ours We did not speak Sobs were heard and Benjamin's lips were unsealed for his mother was weeping on his neck How vividly does memory bring back that sad night Mother and son talked together He had asked her pardon for the suffering he had caused her She said she had nothing to forgive she could not blame his desire for freedom He told her that when he was captured he broke away and was about casting himself into the river when thoughts of her came over him and he desisted She asked if he did not also think of God I fancied I saw his face grow fierce in the moonlight He answered No I did not think of him When a man is hunted like a wild beast he forgets there is a God a heaven He forgets every thing in his struggle to get beyond the reach of the bloodhounds Don't talk so Benjamin said she Put your trust in God Be humble my child and your master will forgive you Forgive me for what mother For not letting him treat me like a dog No I will never humble myself to him I have worked for him for nothing all my life and I am repaid with stripes and imprisonment Here I will stay till I die or till he sells me The poor mother shuddered at his words I think he felt it for when he next spoke his voice was calmer Don't fret about me mother I ain't worth it said he I wish I had some of your goodness You bear every thing patiently just as though you thought it was all right I wish I could She told him she had not always been so once she was like him but when sore troubles came upon her and she had no arm to lean upon she learned to call on God and he lightened her burdens She besought him to do likewise We overstaid our time and were obliged to hurry from the jail Benjamin had been imprisoned three weeks when my grandmother went to intercede for him with his master He was immovable He said Benjamin should serve as an example to the rest of his slaves he should be kept in jail till he was subdued or be sold if he got but one dollar for him However he afterwards relented in some degree The chains were taken off and we were allowed to visit him As his food was of the coarsest kind we carried him as often as possible a warm supper accompanied with some little luxury for the jailer Three months elapsed and there was no prospect of release or of a purchaser One day he was heard to sing and laugh This piece of indecorum was told to his master and the overseer was ordered to re-chain him He was now confined in an apartment with other prisoners who were covered with filthy rags Benjamin was chained near them and was soon covered with vermin He worked at his chains till he succeeded in getting out of them He passed them through the bars of the window with a request that they should be taken to his master and he should be informed that he was covered with vermin This audacity was punished with heavier chains and prohibition of our visits My grandmother continued to send him fresh changes of clothes The old ones were burned up The last night we saw him in jail his mother still begged him to send for his master and beg his pardon Neither persuasion nor argument could turn him from his purpose He calmly answered I am waiting his time Those chains were mournful to hear Another three months passed and Benjamin left his prison walls We that loved him waited to bid him a long and last farewell A slave trader had bought him You remember I told you what price he brought when ten years of age Now he was more than twenty years old and sold for three hundred dollars The master had been blind to his own interest Long confinement had made his face too pale his form too thin moreover the trader had heard something of his character and it did not strike him as suitable for a slave He said he would give any price if the handsome lad was a girl We thanked God that he was not Could you have seen that mother clinging to her child when they fastened the irons upon his wrists could you have heard her heart-rending groans and seen her bloodshot eyes wander wildly from face to face vainly pleading for mercy could you have witnessed that scene as I saw it you would exclaim Slavery is damnable Benjamin her youngest her pet was forever gone She could not realize it She had had an interview with the trader for the purpose of ascertaining if Benjamin could be purchased She was told it was impossible as he had given bonds not to sell him till he was out of the state He promised that he would not sell him till he reached New Orleans With a strong arm and unvaried trust my grandmother began her work of love Benjamin must be free If she succeeded she knew they would still be separated but the sacrifice was not too great Day and night she labored The trader's price would treble that he gave but she was not discouraged She employed a lawyer to write to a gentleman whom she knew in New Orleans She begged him to interest himself for Benjamin and he willingly favored her request When he saw Benjamin and stated his business he thanked him but said he preferred to wait a while before making the trader an offer He knew he had tried to obtain a high price for him and had invariably failed This encouraged him to make another effort for freedom So one morning long before day Benjamin was missing He was riding over the blue billows bound for Baltimore For once his white face did him a kindly service They had no suspicion that it belonged to a slave otherwise the law would have been followed out to the letter and the thing rendered back to slavery The brightest skies are often overshadowed by the darkest clouds Benjamin was taken sick and compelled to remain in Baltimore three weeks His strength was slow in returning and his desire to continue his journey seemed to retard his recovery How could he get strength without air and exercise He resolved to venture on a short walk A by-street was selected where he thought himself secure of not being met by any one that knew him but a voice called out Halloo Ben my boy what are you doing here His first impulse was to run but his legs trembled so that he could not stir He turned to confront his antagonist and behold there stood his old master's next door neighbor He thought it was all over with him now but it proved otherwise That man was a miracle He possessed a goodly number of slaves and yet was not quite deaf to that mystic clock whose ticking is rarely heard in the slaveholder's breast Ben you are sick said he Why you look like a ghost I guess I gave you something of a start Never mind Ben I am not going to touch you You had a pretty tough time of it and you may go on your way rejoicing for all me But I would advise you to get out of this place plaguy quick for there are several gentlemen here from our town He described the nearest and safest route to New York and added I shall be glad to tell your mother I have seen you Good by Ben Benjamin turned away filled with gratitude and surprised that the town he hated contained such a gema gem worthy of a purer setting This gentleman was a Northerner by birth and had married a southern lady On his return he told my grandmother that he had seen her son and of the service he had rendered him Benjamin reached New York safely and concluded to stop there until he had gained strength enough to proceed further It happened that my grandmother's only remaining son had sailed for the same city on business for his mistress Through God's providence the brothers met You may be sure it was a happy meeting O Phil exclaimed Benjamin I am here at last Then he told him how near he came to dying almost in sight of free land and how he prayed that he might live to get one breath of free air He said life was worth something now and it would be hard to die In the old jail he had not valued it once he was tempted to destroy it but something he did not know what had prevented him perhaps it was fear He had heard those who profess to be religious declare there was no heaven for self-murderers and as his life had been pretty hot here he did not desire a continuation of the same in another world If I die now he exclaimed thank God I shall die a freeman He begged my uncle Phillip not to return south but stay and work with him till they earned enough to buy those at home His brother told him it would kill their mother if he deserted her in her trouble She had pledged her house and with difficulty had raised money to buy him Would he be bought No never he replied Do you suppose Phil when I have got so far out of their clutches I will give them one red cent No And do you suppose I would turn mother out of her home in her old age That I would let her pay all those hard-earned dollars for me and never to see me For you know she will stay south as long as her other children are slaves What a good mother Tell her to buy you Phil You have been a comfort to her and I have been a trouble And Linda poor Linda what'll become of her Phil you don't know what a life they lead her She has told me something about it and I wish old Flint was dead or a better man When I was in jail he asked her if she didn't want him to ask my master to forgive me and take me home again She told him No that I didn't want to go back He got mad and said we were all alike I never despised my own master half as much as I do that man There is many a worse slaveholder than my master but for all that I would not be his slave While Benjamin was sick he had parted with nearly all his clothes to pay necessary expenses But he did not part with a little pin I fastened in his bosom when we parted It was the most valuable thing I owned and I thought none more worthy to wear it He had it still His brother furnished him with clothes and gave him what money he had They parted with moistened eyes and as Benjamin turned away he said Phil I part with all my kindred And so it proved We never heard from him again Uncle Phillip came home and the first words he uttered when he entered the house were Mother Ben is free I have seen him in New York She stood looking at him with a bewildered air Mother don't you believe it he said laying his hand softly upon her shoulder She raised her hands and exclaimed God be praised Let us thank him She dropped on her knees and poured forth her heart in prayer Then Phillip must sit down and repeat to her every word Benjamin had said He told her all only he forbore to mention how sick and pale her darling looked Why should he distress her when she could do him no good The brave old woman still toiled on hoping to rescue some of her other children After a while she succeeded in buying Phillip She paid eight hundred dollars and came home with the precious document that secured his freedom The happy mother and son sat together by the old hearthstone that night telling how proud they were of each other and how they would prove to the world that they could take care of themselves as they had long taken care of others We all concluded by saying He that is willing to be a slave let him be a slave V THE TRIALS OF GIRLHOOD DURING the first years of my service in Dr Flint's family I was accustomed to share some indulgences with the children of my mistress Though this seemed to me no more than right I was grateful for it and tried to merit the kindness by the faithful discharge of my duties But I now entered on my fifteenth yeara sad epoch in the life of a slave girl My master began to whisper foul words in my ear Young as I was I could not remain ignorant of their import I tried to treat them with indifference or contempt The master's age my extreme youth and the fear that his conduct would be reported to my grandmother made him bear this treatment for many months He was a crafty man and resorted to many means to accomplish his purposes Sometimes he had stormy terrific ways that made his victims tremble sometimes he assumed a gentleness that he thought must surely subdue Of the two I preferred his stormy moods although they left me trembling He tried his utmost to corrupt the pure principles my grandmother had instilled He peopled my young mind with unclean images such as only a vile monster could think of I turned from him with disgust and hatred But he was my master I was compelled to live under the same roof with himwhere I saw a man forty years my senior daily violating the most sacred commandments of nature He told me I was his property that I must be subject to his will in all things My soul revolted against the mean tyranny But where could I turn for protection No matter whether the slave girl be as black as ebony or as fair as her mistress In either case there is no shadow of law to protect her from insult from violence or even from death all these are inflicted by fiends who bear the shape of men The mistress who ought to protect the helpless victim has no other feelings towards her but those of jealousy and rage The degradation the wrongs the vices that grow out of slavery are more than I can describe They are greater than you would willingly believe Surely if you credited one half the truths that are told you concerning the helpless millions suffering in this cruel bondage you at the north would not help to tighten the yoke You surely would refuse to do for the master on your own soil the mean and cruel work which trained bloodhounds and the lowest class of whites do for him at the south Every where the years bring to all enough of sin and sorrow but in slavery the very dawn of life is darkened by these shadows Even the little child who is accustomed to wait on her mistress and her children will learn before she is twelve years old why it is that her mistress hates such and such a one among the slaves Perhaps the child's own mother is among those hated ones She listens to violent outbreaks of jealous passion and cannot help understanding what is the cause She will become prematurely knowing in evil things Soon she will learn to tremble when she hears her master's footfall She will be compelled to realize that she is no longer a child If God has bestowed beauty upon her it will prove her greatest curse That which commands admiration in the white woman only hastens the degradation of the female slave I know that some are too much brutalized by slavery to feel the humiliation of their position but many slaves feel it most acutely and shrink from the memory of it I cannot tell how much I suffered in the presence of these wrongs nor how I am still pained by the retrospect My master met me at every turn reminding me that I belonged to him and swearing by heaven and earth that he would compel me to submit to him If I went out for a breath of fresh air after a day of unwearied toil his footsteps dogged me If I knelt by my mother's grave his dark shadow fell on me even there The light heart which nature had given me became heavy with sad forebodings The other slaves in my master's house noticed the change Many of them pitied me but none dared to ask the cause They had no need to inquire They knew too well the guilty practices under that roof and they were aware that to speak of them was an offence that never went unpunished I longed for some one to confide in I would have given the world to have laid my head on my grandmother's faithful bosom and told her all my troubles But Dr Flint swore he would kill me if I was not as silent as the grave Then although my grandmother was all in all to me I feared her as well as loved her I had been accustomed to look up to her with a respect bordering upon awe I was very young and felt shamefaced about telling her such impure things especially as I knew her to be very strict on such subjects Moreover she was a woman of a high spirit She was usually very quiet in her demeanor but if her indignation was once roused it was not very easily quelled I had been told that she once chased a white gentleman with a loaded pistol because he insulted one of her daughters I dreaded the consequences of a violent outbreak and both pride and fear kept me silent But though I did not confide in my grandmother and even evaded her vigilant watchfulness and inquiry her presence in the neighborhood was some protection to me Though she had been a slave Dr Flint was afraid of her He dreaded her scorching rebukes Moreover she was known and patronized by many people and he did not wish to have his villany made public It was lucky for me that I did not live on a distant plantation but in a town not so large that the inhabitants were ignorant of each other's affairs Bad as are the laws and customs in a slaveholding community the doctor as a professional man deemed it prudent to keep up some outward show of decency O what days and nights of fear and sorrow that man caused me Reader it is not to awaken sympathy for myself that I am telling you truthfully what I suffered in slavery I do it to kindle a flame of compassion in your hearts for my sisters who are still in bondage suffering as I once suffered I once saw two beautiful children playing together One was a fair white child the other was her slave and also her sister When I saw them embracing each other and heard their joyous laughter I turned sadly away from the lovely sight I foresaw the inevitable blight that would fall on the little slave's heart I knew how soon her laughter would be changed to sighs The fair child grew up to be a still fairer woman From childhood to womanhood her pathway was blooming with flowers and overarched by a sunny sky Scarcely one day of her life had been clouded when the sun rose on her happy bridal morning How had those years dealt with her slave sister the little playmate of her childhood She also was very beautiful but the flowers and sunshine of love were not for her She drank the cup of sin and shame and misery whereof her persecuted race are compelled to drink In view of these things why are ye silent ye free men and women of the north Why do your tongues falter in maintenance of the right Would that I had more ability But my heart is so full and my pen is so weak There are noble men and women who plead for us striving to help those who cannot help themselves God bless them God give them strength and courage to go on God bless those every where who are laboring to advance the cause of humanity VI THE JEALOUS MISTRESS I WOULD ten thousand times rather that my children should be the half-starved paupers of Ireland than to be the most pampered among the slaves of America I would rather drudge out my life on a cotton plantation till the grave opened to give me rest than to live with an unprincipled master and a jealous mistress The felon's home in a penitentiary is preferable He may repent and turn from the error of his ways and so find peace but it is not so with a favorite slave She is not allowed to have any pride of character It is deemed a crime in her to wish to be virtuous Mrs Flint possessed the key to her husband's character before I was born She might have used this knowledge to counsel and to screen the young and the innocent among her slaves but for them she had no sympathy They were the objects of her constant suspicion and malevolence She watched her husband with unceasing vigilance but he was well practiced in means to evade it What he could not find opportunity to say in words he manifested in signs He invented more than were ever thought of in a deaf and dumb asylum I let them pass as if I did not understand what he meant and many were the curses and threats bestowed on me for my stupidity One day he caught me teaching myself to write He frowned as if he was not well pleased but I suppose he came to the conclusion that such an accomplishment might help to advance his favorite scheme Before long notes were often slipped into my hand I would return them saying I can't read them sir Can't you he replied then I must read them to you He always finished the reading by asking Do you understand Sometimes he would complain of the heat of the tea room and order his supper to be placed on a small table in the piazza He would seat himself there with a well-satisfied smile and tell me to stand by and brush away the flies He would eat very slowly pausing between the mouthfuls These intervals were employed in describing the happiness I was so foolishly throwing away and in threatening me with the penalty that finally awaited my stubborn disobedience He boasted much of the forbearance he had exercised towards me and reminded me that there was a limit to his patience When I succeeded in avoiding opportunities for him to talk to me at home I was ordered to come to his office to do some errand When there I was obliged to stand and listen to such language as he saw fit to address to me Sometimes I so openly expressed my contempt for him that he would become violently enraged and I wondered why he did not strike me Circumstanced as he was he probably thought it was better policy to be forbearing But the state of things grew worse and worse daily In desperation I told him that I must and would apply to my grandmother for protection He threatened me with death and worse than death if I made any complaint to her Strange to say I did not despair I was naturally of a buoyant disposition and always I had hope of somehow getting out of his clutches Like many a poor simple slave before me I trusted that some threads of joy would yet be woven into my dark destiny I had entered my sixteenth year and every day it became more apparent that my presence was intolerable to Mrs Flint Angry words frequently passed between her and her husband He had never punished me himself and he would not allow any body else to punish me In that respect she was never satisfied but in her angry moods no terms were too vile for her to bestow upon me Yet I whom she detested so bitterly had far more pity for her than he had whose duty it was to make her life happy I never wronged her or wished to wrong her and one word of kindness from her would have brought me to her feet After repeated quarrels between the doctor and his wife he announced his intention to take his youngest daughter then four years old to sleep in his apartment It was necessary that a servant should sleep in the same room to be on hand if the child stirred I was selected for that office and informed for what purpose that arrangement had been made By managing to keep within sight of people as much as possible during the day time I had hitherto succeeded in eluding my master though a razor was often held to my throat to force me to change this line of policy At night I slept by the side of my great aunt where I felt safe He was too prudent to come into her room She was an old woman and had been in the family many years Moreover as a married man and a professional man he deemed it necessary to save appearances in some degree But he resolved to remove the obstacle in the way of his scheme and he thought he had planned it so that he should evade suspicion He was well aware how much I prized my refuge by the side of my old aunt and he determined to dispossess me of it The first night the doctor had the little child in his room alone The next morning I was ordered to take my station as nurse the following night A kind Providence interposed in my favor During the day Mrs Flint heard of this new arrangement and a storm followed I rejoiced to hear it rage After a while my mistress sent for me to come to her room Her first question was Did you know you were to sleep in the doctor's room Yes ma'am Who told you My master Will you answer truly all the questions I ask Yes ma'am Tell me then as you hope to be forgiven are you innocent of what I have accused you I am She handed me a Bible and said Lay your hand on your heart kiss this holy book and swear before God that you tell me the truth I took the oath she required and I did it with a clear conscience You have taken God's holy word to testify your innocence said she If you have deceived me beware Now take this stool sit down look me directly in the face and tell me all that has passed between your master and you I did as she ordered As I went on with my account her color changed frequently she wept and sometimes groaned She spoke in tones so sad that I was touched by her grief The tears came to my eyes but I was soon convinced that her emotions arose from anger and wounded pride She felt that her marriage vows were desecrated her dignity insulted but she had no compassion for the poor victim of her husband's perfidy She pitied herself as a martyr but she was incapable of feeling for the condition of shame and misery in which her unfortunate helpless slave was placed Yet perhaps she had some touch of feeling for me for when the conference was ended she spoke kindly and promised to protect me I should have been much comforted by this assurance if I could have had confidence in it but my experiences in slavery had filled me with distrust She was not a very refined woman and had not much control over her passions I was an object of her jealousy and consequently of her hatred and I knew I could not expect kindness or confidence from her under the circumstances in which I was placed I could not blame her Slave-holders' wives feel as other women would under similar circumstances The fire of her temper kindled from small sparks and now the flame became so intense that the doctor was obliged to give up his intended arrangement I knew I had ignited the torch and I expected to suffer for it afterwards but I felt too thankful to my mistress for the timely aid she rendered me to care much about that She now took me to sleep in a room adjoining her own There I was an object of her especial care though not of her especial comfort for she spent many a sleepless night to watch over me Sometimes I woke up and found her bending over me At other times she whispered in my ear as though it was her husband who was speaking to me and listened to hear what I would answer If she startled me on such occasions she would glide stealthily away and the next morning she would tell me I had been talking in my sleep and ask who I was talking to At last I began to be fearful for my life It had been often threatened and you can imagine better than I can describe what an unpleasant sensation it must produce to wake up in the dead of night and find a jealous woman bending over you Terrible as this experience was I had fears that it would give place to one more terrible My mistress grew weary of her vigils they did not prove satisfactory She changed her tactics She now tried the trick of accusing my master of crime in my presence and gave my name as the author of the accusation To my utter astonishment he replied I don't believe it but if she did acknowledge it you tortured her into exposing me Tortured into exposing him Truly Satan had no difficulty in distinguishing the color of his soul I understood his object in making this false representation It was to show me that I gained nothing by seeking the protection of my mistress that the power was still all in his own hands I pitied Mrs Flint She was a second wife many years the junior of her husband and the hoary-headed miscreant was enough to try the patience of a wiser and better woman She was completely foiled and knew not how to proceed She would gladly have had me flogged for my supposed false oath but as I have already stated the doctor never allowed any one to whip me The old sinner was politic The application of the lash might have led to remarks that would have exposed him in the eyes of his children and grandchildren How often did I rejoice that I lived in a town where all the inhabitants knew each other If I had been on a remote plantation or lost among the multitude of a crowded city I should not be a living woman at this day The secrets of slavery are concealed like those of the Inquisition My master was to my knowledge the father of eleven slaves But did the mothers dare to tell who was the father of their children Did the other slaves dare to allude to it except in whispers among themselves No indeed They knew too well the terrible consequences My grandmother could not avoid seeing things which excited her suspicions She was uneasy about me and tried various ways to buy me but the never-changing answer was always repeated Linda does not belong to me She is my daughter's property and I have no legal right to sell her The conscientious man He was too scrupulous to sell me but he had no scruples whatever about committing a much greater wrong against the helpless young girl placed under his guardianship as his daughter's property Sometimes my persecutor would ask me whether I would like to be sold I told him I would rather be sold to any body than to lead such a life as I did On such occasions he would assume the air of a very injured individual and reproach me for my ingratitude Did I not take you into the house and make you the companion of my own children he would say Have I ever treated you like a negro I have never allowed you to be punished not even to please your mistress And this is the recompense I get you ungrateful girl I answered that he had reasons of his own for screening me from punishment and that the course he pursued made my mistress hate me and persecute me If I wept he would say Poor child Don't cry don't cry I will make peace for you with your mistress Only let me arrange matters in my own way Poor foolish girl you don't know what is for your own good I would cherish you I would make a lady of you Now go and think of all I have promised you I did think of it Reader I draw no imaginary pictures of southern homes I am telling you the plain truth Yet when victims make their escape from this wild beast of Slavery northerners consent to act the part of bloodhounds and hunt the poor fugitive back into his den full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness Nay more they are not only willing but proud to give their daughters in marriage to slaveholders The poor girls have romantic notions of a sunny clime and of the flowering vines that all the year round shade a happy home To what disappointments are they destined The young wife soon learns that the husband in whose hands she has placed her happiness pays no regard to his marriage vows Children of every shade of complexion play with her own fair babies and too well she knows that they are born unto him of his own household Jealousy and hatred enter the flowery home and it is ravaged of its loveliness Southern women often marry a man knowing that he is the father of many little slaves They do not trouble themselves about it They regard such children as property as marketable as the pigs on the plantation and it is seldom that they do not make them aware of this by passing them into the slave-trader's hands as soon as possible and thus getting them out of their sight I am glad to say there are some honorable exceptions I have myself known two southern wives who exhorted their husbands to free those slaves towards whom they stood in a parental relation and their request was granted These husbands blushed before the superior nobleness of their wives' natures Though they had only counselled them to do that which it was their duty to do it commanded their respect and rendered their conduct more exemplary Concealment was at an end and confidence took the place of distrust Though this bad institution deadens the moral sense even in white women to a fearful extent it is not altogether extinct I have heard southern ladies say of Mr Such a one He not only thinks it no disgrace to be the father of those little niggers but he is not ashamed to call himself their master I declare such things ought not to be tolerated in any decent society VII THE LOVER WHY does the slave ever love Why allow the tendrils of the heart to twine around objects which may at any moment be wrenched away by the hand of violence When separations come by the hand of death the pious soul can bow in resignation and say Not my will but thine be done O Lord But when the ruthless hand of man strikes the blow regardless of the misery he causes it is hard to be submissive I did not reason thus when I was a young girl Youth will be youth I loved and I indulged the hope that the dark clouds around me would turn out a bright lining I forgot that in the land of my birth the shadows are too dense for light to penetrate A land Where laughter is not mirth nor thought the mind Nor words a language nor e'en men mankind Where cries reply to curses shrieks to blows And each is tortured in his separate hell There was in the neighborhood a young colored carpenter a free born man We had been well acquainted in childhood and frequently met together afterwards We became mutually attached and he proposed to marry me I loved him with all the ardor of a young girl's first love But when I reflected that I was a slave and that the laws gave no sanction to the marriage of such my heart sank within me My lover wanted to buy me but I knew that Dr Flint was too wilful and arbitrary a man to consent to that arrangement From him I was sure of experiencing all sorts of opposition and I had nothing to hope from my mistress She would have been delighted to have got rid of me but not in that way It would have relieved her mind of a burden if she could have seen me sold to some distant state but if I was married near home I should be just as much in her husband's power as I had previously beenfor the husband of a slave has no power to protect her Moreover my mistress like many others seemed to think that slaves had no right to any family ties of their own that they were created merely to wait upon the family of the mistress I once heard her abuse a young slave girl who told her that a colored man wanted to make her his wife I will have you peeled and pickled my lady said she if I ever hear you mention that subject again Do you suppose that I will have you tending my children with the children of that nigger The girl to whom she said this had a mulatto child of course not acknowledged by its father The poor black man who loved her would have been proud to acknowledge his helpless offspring Many and anxious were the thoughts I revolved in my mind I was at a loss what to do Above all things I was desirous to spare my lover the insults that had cut so deeply into my own soul I talked with my grandmother about it and partly told her my fears I did not dare to tell her the worst She had long suspected all was not right and if I confirmed her suspicions I knew a storm would rise that would prove the overthrow of all my hopes This love-dream had been my support through many trials and I could not bear to run the risk of having it suddenly dissipated There was a lady in the neighborhood a particular friend of Dr Flint's who often visited the house I had a great respect for her and she had always manifested a friendly interest in me Grandmother thought she would have great influence with the doctor I went to this lady and told her my story I told her I was aware that my lover's being a free-born man would prove a great objection but he wanted to buy me and if Dr Flint would consent to that arrangement I felt sure he would be willing to pay any reasonable price She knew that Mrs Flint disliked me therefore I ventured to suggest that perhaps my mistress would approve of my being sold as that would rid her of me The lady listened with kindly sympathy and promised to do her utmost to promote my wishes She had an interview with the doctor and I believe she pleaded my cause earnestly but it was all to no purpose How I dreaded my master now Every minute I expected to be summoned to his presence but the day passed and I heard nothing from him The next morning a message was brought to me Master wants you in his study I found the door ajar and I stood a moment gazing at the hateful man who claimed a right to rule me body and soul I entered and tried to appear calm I did not want him to know how my heart was bleeding He looked fixedly at me with an expression which seemed to say I have half a mind to kill you on the spot At last he broke the silence and that was a relief to both of us So you want to be married do you said he and to a free nigger Yes sir Well I'll soon convince you whether I am your master or the nigger fellow you honor so highly If you must have a husband you may take up with one of my slaves What a situation I should be in as the wife of one of his slaves even if my heart had been interested I replied Don't you suppose sir that a slave can have some preference about marrying Do you suppose that all men are alike to her Do you love this nigger said he abruptly Yes sir How dare you tell me so he exclaimed in great wrath After a slight pause he added I supposed you thought more of yourself that you felt above the insults of such puppies I replied If he is a puppy I am a puppy for we are both of the negro race It is right and honorable for us to love each other The man you call a puppy never insulted me sir and he would not love me if he did not believe me to be a virtuous woman He sprang upon me like a tiger and gave me a stunning blow It was the first time he had ever struck me and fear did not enable me to control my anger When I had recovered a little from the effects I exclaimed You have struck me for answering you honestly How I despise you There was silence for some minutes Perhaps he was deciding what should be my punishment or perhaps he wanted to give me time to reflect on what I had said and to whom I had said it Finally he asked Do you know what you have said Yes sir but your treatment drove me to it Do you know that I have a right to do as I like with youthat I can kill you if I please You have tried to kill me and I wish you had but you have no right to do as you like with me Silence he exclaimed in a thundering voice By heavens girl you forget yourself too far Are you mad If you are I will soon bring you to your senses Do you think any other master would bear what I have borne from you this morning Many masters would have killed you on the spot How would you like to be sent to jail for your insolence I know I have been disrespectful sir I replied but you drove me to it I couldn't help it As for the jail there would be more peace for me there than there is here You deserve to go there said he and to be under such treatment that you would forget the meaning of the word peace It would do you good It would take some of your high notions out of you But I am not ready to send you there yet notwithstanding your ingratitude for all my kindness and forbearance You have been the plague of my life I have wanted to make you happy and I have been repaid with the basest ingratitude but though you have proved yourself incapable of appreciating my kindness I will be lenient towards you Linda I will give you one more chance to redeem your character If you behave yourself and do as I require I will forgive you and treat you as I always have done but if you disobey me I will punish you as I would the meanest slave on my plantation Never let me hear that fellow's name mentioned again If I ever know of your speaking to him I will cowhide you both and if I catch him lurking about my premises I will shoot him as soon as I would a dog Do you hear what I say I'll teach you a lesson about marriage and free niggers Now go and let this be the last time I have occasion to speak to you on this subject Reader did you ever hate I hope not I never did but once and I trust I never shall again Somebody has called it the atmosphere of hell and I believe it is so For a fortnight the doctor did not speak to me He thought to mortify me to make me feel that I had disgraced myself by receiving the honorable addresses of a respectable colored man in preference to the base proposals of a white man But though his lips disdained to address me his eyes were very loquacious No animal ever watched its prey more narrowly than he watched me He knew that I could write though he had failed to make me read his letters and he was now troubled lest I should exchange letters with another man After a while he became weary of silence and I was sorry for it One morning as he passed through the hall to leave the house he contrived to thrust a note into my hand I thought I had better read it and spare myself the vexation of having him read it to me It expressed regret for the blow he had given me and reminded me that I myself was wholly to blame for it He hoped I had become convinced of the injury I was doing myself by incurring his displeasure He wrote that he had made up his mind to go to Louisiana that he should take several slaves with him and intended I should be one of the number My mistress would remain where she was therefore I should have nothing to fear from that quarter If I merited kindness from him he assured me that it would be lavishly bestowed He begged me to think over the matter and answer the following day The next morning I was called to carry a pair of scissors to his room I laid them on the table with the letter beside them He thought it was my answer and did not call me back I went as usual to attend my young mistress to and from school He met me in the street and ordered me to stop at his office on my way back When I entered he showed me his letter and asked me why I had not answered it I replied I am your daughter's property and it is in your power to send me or take me wherever you please He said he was very glad to find me so willing to go and that we should start early in the autumn He had a large practice in the town and I rather thought he had made up the story merely to frighten me However that might be I was determined that I would never go to Louisiana with him Summer passed away and early in the autumn Dr Flint's eldest son was sent to Louisiana to examine the country with a view to emigrating That news did not disturb me I knew very well that I should not be sent with him That I had not been taken to the plantation before this time was owing to the fact that his son was there He was jealous of his son and jealousy of the overseer had kept him from punishing me by sending me into the fields to work Is it strange that I was not proud of these protectors As for the overseer he was a man for whom I had less respect than I had for a bloodhound Young Mr Flint did not bring back a favorable report of Louisiana and I heard no more of that scheme Soon after this my lover met me at the corner of the street and I stopped to speak to him Looking up I saw my master watching us from his window I hurried home trembling with fear I was sent for immediately to go to his room He met me with a blow When is mistress to be married said he in a sneering tone A shower of oaths and imprecations followed How thankful I was that my lover was a free man that my tyrant had no power to flog him for speaking to me in the street Again and again I revolved in my mind how all this would end There was no hope that the doctor would consent to sell me on any terms He had an iron will and was determined to keep me and to conquer me My lover was an intelligent and religious man Even if he could have obtained permission to marry me while I was a slave the marriage would give him no power to protect me from my master It would have made him miserable to witness the insults I should have been subjected to And then if we had children I knew they must follow the condition of the mother What a terrible blight that would be on the heart of a free intelligent father For his sake I felt that I ought not to link his fate with my own unhappy destiny He was going to Savannah to see about a little property left him by an uncle and hard as it was to bring my feelings to it I earnestly entreated him not to come back I advised him to go to the Free States where his tongue would not be tied and where his intelligence would be of more avail to him He left me still hoping the day would come when I could be bought With me the lamp of hope had gone out The dream of my girlhood was over I felt lonely and desolate Still I was not stripped of all I still had my good grandmother and my affectionate brother When he put his arms round my neck and looked into my eyes as if to read there the troubles I dared not tell I felt that I still had something to love But even that pleasant emotion was chilled by the reflection that he might be torn from me at any moment by some sudden freak of my master If he had known how we loved each other I think he would have exulted in separating us We often planned together how we could get to the north But as William remarked such things are easier said than done My movements were very closely watched and we had no means of getting any money to defray our expenses As for grandmother she was strongly opposed to her children's undertaking any such project She had not forgotten poor Benjamin's sufferings and she was afraid that if another child tried to escape he would have a similar or a worse fate To me nothing seemed more dreadful than my present life I said to myself William must be free He shall go to the north and I will follow him Many a slave sister has formed the same plans VIII WHAT SLAVES ARE TAUGHT TO THINK OF THE NORTH SLAVEHOLDERS pride themselves upon being honorable men but if you were to hear the enormous lies they tell their slaves you would have small respect for their veracity I have spoken plain English Pardon me I cannot use a milder term When they visit the north and return home they tell their slaves of the runaways they have seen and describe them to be in the most deplorable condition A slaveholder once told me that he had seen a runaway friend of mine in New York and that she besought him to take her back to her master for she was literally dying of starvation that many days she had only one cold potato to eat and at other times could get nothing at all He said he refused to take her because he knew her master would not thank him for bringing such a miserable wretch to his house He ended by saying to me This is the punishment she brought on herself for running away from a kind master This whole story was false I afterwards staid with that friend in New York and found her in comfortable circumstances She had never thought of such a thing as wishing to go back to slavery Many of the slaves believe such stories and think it is not worth while to exchange slavery for such a hard kind of freedom It is difficult to persuade such that freedom could make them useful men and enable them to protect their wives and children If those heathen in our Christian land had as much teaching as some Hindoos they would think otherwise They would know that liberty is more valuable than life They would begin to understand their own capabilities and exert themselves to become men and women But while the Free States sustain a law which hurls fugitives back into slavery how can the slaves resolve to become men There are some who strive to protect wives and daughters from the insults of their masters but those who have such sentiments have had advantages above the general mass of slaves They have been partially civilized and Christianized by favorable circumstances Some are bold enough to utter such sentiments to their masters O that there were more of them Some poor creatures have been so brutalized by the lash that they will sneak out of the way to give their masters free access to their wives and daughters Do you think this proves the black man to belong to an inferior order of beings What would you be if you had been born and brought up a slave with generations of slaves for ancestors I admit that the black man is inferior But what is it that makes him so It is the ignorance in which white men compel him to live it is the torturing whip that lashes manhood out of him it is the fierce bloodhounds of the South and the scarcely less cruel human bloodhounds of the north who enforce the Fugitive Slave Law They do the work Southern gentlemen indulge in the most contemptuous expressions about the Yankees while they on their part consent to do the vilest work for them such as the ferocious bloodhounds and the despised negro-hunters are employed to do at home When southerners go to the north they are proud to do them honor but the northern man is not welcome south of Mason Dixon's line unless he suppresses every thought and feeling at variance with their peculiar institution Nor is it enough to be silent The masters are not pleased unless they obtain a greater degree of subservience than that and they are generally accommodated Do they respect the northerner for this I trow not Even the slaves despise a northern man with southern principles and that is the class they generally see When northerners go to the south to reside they prove very apt scholars They soon imbibe the sentiments and disposition of their neighbors and generally go beyond their teachers Of the two they are proverbially the hardest masters They seem to satisfy their consciences with the doctrine that God created the Africans to be slaves What a libel upon the heavenly Father who made of one blood all nations of men And then who are Africans Who can measure the amount of Anglo-Saxon blood coursing in the veins of American slaves I have spoken of the pains slaveholders take to give their slaves a bad opinion of the north but notwithstanding this intelligent slaves are aware that they have many friends in the Free States Even the most ignorant have some confused notions about it They knew that I could read and I was often asked if I had seen any thing in the newspapers about white folks over in the big north who were trying to get their freedom for them Some believe that the abolitionists have already made them free and that it is established by law but that their masters prevent the law from going into effect One woman begged me to get a newspaper and read it over She said her husband told her that the black people had sent word to the queen of 'Merica that they were all slaves that she didn't believe it and went to Washington city to see the president about it They quarrelled she drew her sword upon him and swore that he should help her to make them all free That poor ignorant woman thought that America was governed by a Queen to whom the President was subordinate I wish the President was subordinate to Queen Justice IX SKETCHES OF NEIGHBORING SLAVEHOLDERS THERE was a planter in the country not far from us whom I will call Mr Litch He was an ill-bred uneducated man but very wealthy He had six hundred slaves many of whom he did not know by sight His extensive plantation was managed by well-paid overseers There was a jail and a whipping post on his grounds and whatever cruelties were perpetrated there they passed without comment He was so effectually screened by his great wealth that he was called to no account for his crimes not even for murder Various were the punishments resorted to A favorite one was to tie a rope round a man's body and suspend him from the ground A fire was kindled over him from which was suspended a piece of fat pork As this cooked the scalding drops of fat continually fell on the bare flesh On his own plantation he required very strict obedience to the eighth commandment But depredations on the neighbors were allowable provided the culprit managed to evade detection or suspicion If a neighbor brought a charge of theft against any of his slaves he was browbeaten by the master who assured him that his slaves had enough of every thing at home and had no inducement to steal No sooner was the neighbor's back turned than the accused was sought out and whipped for his lack of discretion If a slave stole from him even a pound of meat or a peck of corn if detection followed he was put in chains and imprisoned and so kept till his form was attenuated by hunger and suffering A freshet once bore his wine cellar and meat house miles away from the plantation Some slaves followed and secured bits of meat and bottles of wine Two were detected a ham and some liquor being found in their huts They were summoned by their master No words were used but a club felled them to the ground A rough box was their coffin and their interment was a dog's burial Nothing was said Murder was so common on his plantation that he feared to be alone after nightfall He might have believed in ghosts His brother if not equal in wealth was at least equal in cruelty His bloodhounds were well trained Their pen was spacious and a terror to the slaves They were let loose on a runaway and if they tracked him they literally tore the flesh from his bones When this slaveholder died his shrieks and groans were so frightful that they appalled his own friends His last words were I am going to hell bury my money with me After death his eyes remained open To press the lids down silver dollars were laid on them These were buried with him From this circumstance a rumor went abroad that his coffin was filled with money Three times his grave was opened and his coffin taken out The last time his body was found on the ground and a flock of buzzards were pecking at it He was again interred and a sentinel set over his grave The perpetrators were never discovered Cruelty is contagious in uncivilized communities Mr Conant a neighbor of Mr Litch returned from town one evening in a partial state of intoxication His body servant gave him some offence He was divested of his clothes except his shirt whipped and tied to a large tree in front of the house It was a stormy night in winter The wind blew bitterly cold and the boughs of the old tree crackled under falling sleet A member of the family fearing he would freeze to death begged that he might be taken down but the master would not relent He remained there three hours and when he was cut down he was more dead than alive Another slave who stole a pig from this master to appease his hunger was terribly flogged In desperation he tried to run away But at the end of two miles he was so faint with loss of blood he thought he was dying He had a wife and he longed to see her once more Too sick to walk he crept back that long distance on his hands and knees When he reached his master's it was night He had not strength to rise and open the gate He moaned and tried to call for help I had a friend living in the same family At last his cry reached her She went out and found the prostrate man at the gate She ran back to the house for assistance and two men returned with her They carried him in and laid him on the floor The back of his shirt was one clot of blood By means of lard my friend loosened it from the raw flesh She bandaged him gave him cool drink and left him to rest The master said he deserved a hundred more lashes When his own labor was stolen from him he had stolen food to appease his hunger This was his crime Another neighbor was a Mrs Wade At no hour of the day was there cessation of the lash on her premises Her labors began with the dawn and did not cease till long after nightfall The barn was her particular place of torture There she lashed the slaves with the might of a man An old slave of hers once said to me It is hell in missis's house 'Pears I can never get out Day and night I prays to die The mistress died before the old woman and when dying entreated her husband not to permit any one of her slaves to look on her after death A slave who had nursed her children and had still a child in her care watched her chance and stole with it in her arms to the room where lay her dead mistress She gazed a while on her then raised her hand and dealt two blows on her face saying as she did so The devil is got you now She forgot that the child was looking on She had just begun to talk and she said to her father I did see ma and mammy did strike ma so striking her own face with her little hand The master was startled He could not imagine how the nurse could obtain access to the room where the corpse lay for he kept the door locked He questioned her She confessed that what the child had said was true and told how she had procured the key She was sold to Georgia In my childhood I knew a valuable slave named Charity and loved her as all children did Her young mistress married and took her to Louisiana Her little boy James was sold to a good sort of master He became involved in debt and James was sold again to a wealthy slaveholder noted for his cruelty With this man he grew up to manhood receiving the treatment of a dog After a severe whipping to save himself from further infliction of the lash with which he was threatened he took to the woods He was in a most miserable conditioncut by the cowskin half naked half starved and without the means of procuring a crust of bread Some weeks after his escape he was captured tied and carried back to his master's plantation This man considered punishment in his jail on bread and water after receiving hundreds of lashes too mild for the poor slave's offence Therefore he decided after the overseer should have whipped him to his satisfaction to have him placed between the screws of the cotton gin to stay as long as he had been in the woods This wretched creature was cut with the whip from his head to his foot then washed with strong brine to prevent the flesh from mortifying and make it heal sooner than it otherwise would He was then put into the cotton gin which was screwed down only allowing him room to turn on his side when he could not lie on his back Every morning a slave was sent with a piece of bread and bowl of water which were placed within reach of the poor fellow The slave was charged under penalty of severe punishment not to speak to him Four days passed and the slave continued to carry the bread and water On the second morning he found the bread gone but the water untouched When he had been in the press four days and five nights the slave informed his master that the water had not been used for four mornings and that a horrible stench came from the gin house The overseer was sent to examine into it When the press was unscrewed the dead body was found partly eaten by rats and vermin Perhaps the rats that devoured his bread had gnawed him before life was extinct Poor Charity Grandmother and I often asked each other how her affectionate heart would bear the news if she should ever hear of the murder of her son We had known her husband and knew that James was like him in manliness and intelligence These were the qualities that made it so hard for him to be a plantation slave They put him into a rough box and buried him with less feeling than would have been manifested for an old house dog Nobody asked any questions He was a slave and the feeling was that the master had a right to do what he pleased with his own property And what did he care for the value of a slave He had hundreds of them When they had finished their daily toil they must hurry to eat their little morsels and be ready to extinguish their pine knots before nine o'clock when the overseer went his patrol rounds He entered every cabin to see that men and their wives had gone to bed together lest the men from over-fatigue should fall asleep in the chimney corner and remain there till the morning horn called them to their daily task Women are considered of no value unless they continually increase their owner's stock They are put on a par with animals This same master shot a woman through the head who had run away and been brought back to him No one called him to account for it If a slave resisted being whipped the bloodhounds were unpacked and set upon him to tear his flesh from his bones The master who did these things was highly educated and styled a perfect gentleman He also boasted the name and standing of a Christian though Satan never had a truer follower I could tell of more slaveholders as cruel as those I have described They are not exceptions to the general rule I do not say there are no humane slaveholders Such characters do exist notwithstanding the hardening influences around them But they are like angels' visitsfew and far between I knew a young lady who was one of these rare specimens She was an orphan and inherited as slaves a woman and her six children Their father was a free man They had a comfortable home of their own parents and children living together The mother and eldest daughter served their mistress during the day and at night returned to their dwelling which was on the premises The young lady was very pious and there was some reality in her religion She taught her slaves to lead pure lives and wished them to enjoy the fruit of their own industry Her religion was not a garb put on for Sunday and laid aside till Sunday returned again The eldest daughter of the slave mother was promised in marriage to a free man and the day before the wedding this good mistress emancipated her in order that her marriage might have the sanction of law Report said that this young lady cherished an unrequited affection for a man who had resolved to marry for wealth In the course of time a rich uncle of hers died He left six thousand dollars to his two sons by a colored woman and the remainder of his property to this orphan niece The metal soon attracted the magnet The lady and her weighty purse became his She offered to manumit her slavestelling them that her marriage might make unexpected changes in their destiny and she wished to insure their happiness They refused to take their freedom saying that she had always been their best friend and they could not be so happy any where as with her I was not surprised I had often seen them in their comfortable home and thought that the whole town did not contain a happier family They had never felt slavery and when it was too late they were convinced of its reality When the new master claimed this family as his property the father became furious and went to his mistress for protection I can do nothing for you now Harry said she I no longer have the power I had a week ago I have succeeded in obtaining the freedom of your wife but I cannot obtain it for your children The unhappy father swore that nobody should take his children from him He concealed them in the woods for some days but they were discovered and taken The father was put in jail and the two oldest boys sold to Georgia One little girl too young to be of service to her master was left with the wretched mother The other three were carried to their master's plantation The eldest soon became a mother and when the slaveholder's wife looked at the babe she wept bitterly She knew that her own husband had violated the purity she had so carefully inculcated She had a second child by her master and then he sold her and his offspring to his brother She bore two children to the brother and was sold again The next sister went crazy The life she was compelled to lead drove her mad The third one became the mother of five daughters Before the birth of the fourth the pious mistress died To the last she rendered every kindness to the slaves that her unfortunate circumstances permitted She passed away peacefully glad to close her eyes on a life which had been made so wretched by the man she loved This man squandered the fortune he had received and sought to retrieve his affairs by a second marriage but having retired after a night of drunken debauch he was found dead in the morning He was called a good master for he fed and clothed his slaves better than most masters and the lash was not heard on his plantation so frequently as on many others Had it not been for slavery he would have been a better man and his wife a happier woman No pen can give an adequate description of the all-pervading corruption produced by slavery The slave girl is reared in an atmosphere of licentiousness and fear The lash and the foul talk of her master and his sons are her teachers When she is fourteen or fifteen her owner or his sons or the overseer or perhaps all of them begin to bribe her with presents If these fail to accomplish their purpose she is whipped or starved into submission to their will She may have had religious principles inculcated by some pious mother or grandmother or some good mistress she may have a lover whose good opinion and peace of mind are dear to her heart or the profligate men who have power over her may be exceedingly odious to her But resistance is hopeless The poor worm Shall prove her contest vain Life's little day Shall pass and she is gone The slaveholder's sons are of course vitiated even while boys by the unclean influences every where around them Nor do the master's daughters always escape Severe retributions sometimes come upon him for the wrongs he does to the daughters of the slaves The white daughters early hear their parents quarrelling about some female slave Their curiosity is excited and they soon learn the cause They are attended by the young slave girls whom their father has corrupted and they hear such talk as should never meet youthful ears or any other ears They know that the women slaves are subject to their father's authority in all things and in some cases they exercise the same authority over the men slaves I have myself seen the master of such a household whose head was bowed down in shame for it was known in the neighborhood that his daughter had selected one of the meanest slaves on his plantation to be the father of his first grandchild She did not make her advances to her equals nor even to her father's more intelligent servants She selected the most brutalized over whom her authority could be exercised with less fear of exposure Her father half frantic with rage sought to revenge himself on the offending black man but his daughter foreseeing the storm that would arise had given him free papers and sent him out of the state In such cases the infant is smothered or sent where it is never seen by any who know its history But if the white parent is the father instead of the mother the offspring are unblushingly reared for the market If they are girls I have indicated plainly enough what will be their inevitable destiny You may believe what I say for I write only that whereof I know I was twenty-one years in that cage of obscene birds I can testify from my own experience and observation that slavery is a curse to the whites as well as to the blacks It makes the white fathers cruel and sensual the sons violent and licentious it contaminates the daughters and makes the wives wretched And as for the colored race it needs an abler pen than mine to describe the extremity of their sufferings the depth of their degradation Yet few slaveholders seem to be aware of the widespread moral ruin occasioned by this wicked system Their talk is of blighted cotton cropsnot of the blight on their children's souls If you want to be fully convinced of the abominations of slavery go on a southern plantation and call yourself a negro trader Then there will be no concealment and you will see and hear things that will seem to you impossible among human beings with immortal souls X A PERILOUS PASSAGE IN THE SLAVE GIRL'S LIFE AFTER my lover went away Dr Flint contrived a new plan He seemed to have an idea that my fear of my mistress was his greatest obstacle In the blandest tones he told me that he was going to build a small house for me in a secluded place four miles away from the town I shuddered but I was constrained to listen while he talked of his intention to give me a home of my own and to make a lady of me Hitherto I had escaped my dreaded fate by being in the midst of people My grandmother had already had high words with my master about me She had told him pretty plainly what she thought of his character and there was considerable gossip in the neighborhood about our affairs to which the open-mouthed jealousy of Mrs Flint contributed not a little When my master said he was going to build a house for me and that he could do it with little trouble and expense I was in hopes something would happen to frustrate his scheme but I soon heard that the house was actually begun I vowed before my Maker that I would never enter it I had rather toil on the plantation from dawn till dark I had rather live and die in jail than drag on from day to day through such a living death I was determined that the master whom I so hated and loathed who had blighted the prospects of my youth and made my life a desert should not after my long struggle with him succeed at last in trampling his victim under his feet I would do any thing every thing for the sake of defeating him What could I do I thought and thought till I became desperate and made a plunge into the abyss And now reader I come to a period in my unhappy life which I would gladly forget if I could The remembrance fills me with sorrow and shame It pains me to tell you of it but I have promised to tell you the truth and I will do it honestly let it cost me what it may I will not try to screen myself behind the plea of compulsion from a master for it was not so Neither can I plead ignorance or thoughtlessness For years my master had done his utmost to pollute my mind with foul images and to destroy the pure principles inculcated by my grandmother and the good mistress of my childhood The influences of slavery had had the same effect on me that they had on other young girls they had made me prematurely knowing concerning the evil ways of the world I know what I did and I did it with deliberate calculation But O ye happy women whose purity has been sheltered from childhood who have been free to choose the objects of your affection whose homes are protected by law do not judge the poor desolate slave girl too severely If slavery had been abolished I also could have married the man of my choice I could have had a home shielded by the laws and I should have been spared the painful task of confessing what I am now about to relate but all my prospects had been blighted by slavery I wanted to keep myself pure and under the most adverse circumstances I tried hard to preserve my self-respect but I was struggling alone in the powerful grasp of the demon Slavery and the monster proved too strong for me I felt as if I was forsaken by God and man as if all my efforts must be frustrated and I became reckless in my despair I have told you that Dr Flint's persecutions and his wife's jealousy had given rise to some gossip in the neighborhood Among others it chanced that a white unmarried gentleman had obtained some knowledge of the circumstances in which I was placed He knew my grandmother and often spoke to me in the street He became interested for me and asked questions about my master which I answered in part He expressed a great deal of sympathy and a wish to aid me He constantly sought opportunities to see me and wrote to me frequently I was a poor slave girl only fifteen years old So much attention from a superior person was of course flattering for human nature is the same in all I also felt grateful for his sympathy and encouraged by his kind words It seemed to me a great thing to have such a friend By degrees a more tender feeling crept into my heart He was an educated and eloquent gentleman too eloquent alas for the poor slave girl who trusted in him Of course I saw whither all this was tending I knew the impassable gulf between us but to be an object of interest to a man who is not married and who is not her master is agreeable to the pride and feelings of a slave if her miserable situation has left her any pride or sentiment It seems less degrading to give one's self than to submit to compulsion There is something akin to freedom in having a lover who has no control over you except that which he gains by kindness and attachment A master may treat you as rudely as he pleases and you dare not speak moreover the wrong does not seem so great with an unmarried man as with one who has a wife to be made unhappy There may be sophistry in all this but the condition of a slave confuses all principles of morality and in fact renders the practice of them impossible When I found that my master had actually begun to build the lonely cottage other feelings mixed with those I have described Revenge and calculations of interest were added to flattered vanity and sincere gratitude for kindness I knew nothing would enrage Dr Flint so much as to know that I favored another and it was something to triumph over my tyrant even in that small way I thought he would revenge himself by selling me and I was sure my friend Mr Sands would buy me He was a man of more generosity and feeling than my master and I thought my freedom could be easily obtained from him The crisis of my fate now came so near that I was desperate I shuddered to think of being the mother of children that should be owned by my old tyrant I knew that as soon as a new fancy took him his victims were sold far off to get rid of them especially if they had children I had seen several women sold with his babies at the breast He never allowed his offspring by slaves to remain long in sight of himself and his wife Of a man who was not my master I could ask to have my children well supported and in this case I felt confident I should obtain the boon I also felt quite sure that they would be made free With all these thoughts revolving in my mind and seeing no other way of escaping the doom I so much dreaded I made a headlong plunge Pity me and pardon me O virtuous reader You never knew what it is to be a slave to be entirely unprotected by law or custom to have the laws reduce you to the condition of a chattel entirely subject to the will of another You never exhausted your ingenuity in avoiding the snares and eluding the power of a hated tyrant you never shuddered at the sound of his footsteps and trembled within hearing of his voice I know I did wrong No one can feel it more sensibly than I do The painful and humiliating memory will haunt me to my dying day Still in looking back calmly on the events of my life I feel that the slave woman ought not to be judged by the same standard as others The months passed on I had many unhappy hours I secretly mourned over the sorrow I was bringing on my grandmother who had so tried to shield me from harm I knew that I was the greatest comfort of her old age and that it was a source of pride to her that I had not degraded myself like most of the slaves I wanted to confess to her that I was no longer worthy of her love but I could not utter the dreaded words As for Dr Flint I had a feeling of satisfaction and triumph in the thought of telling him From time to time he told me of his intended arrangements and I was silent At last he came and told me the cottage was completed and ordered me to go to it I told him I would never enter it He said I have heard enough of such talk as that You shall go if you are carried by force and you shall remain there I replied I will never go there In a few months I shall be a mother He stood and looked at me in dumb amazement and left the house without a word I thought I should be happy in my triumph over him But now that the truth was out and my relatives would hear of it I felt wretched Humble as were their circumstances they had pride in my good character Now how could I look them in the face My self-respect was gone I had resolved that I would be virtuous though I was a slave I had said Let the storm beat I will brave it till I die And now how humiliated I felt I went to my grandmother My lips moved to make confession but the words stuck in my throat I sat down in the shade of a tree at her door and began to sew I think she saw something unusual was the matter with me The mother of slaves is very watchful She knows there is no security for her children After they have entered their teens she lives in daily expectation of trouble This leads to many questions If the girl is of a sensitive nature timidity keeps her from answering truthfully and this well-meant course has a tendency to drive her from maternal counsels Presently in came my mistress like a mad woman and accused me concerning her husband My grandmother whose suspicions had been previously awakened believed what she said She exclaimed O Linda has it come to this I had rather see you dead than to see you as you now are You are a disgrace to your dead mother She tore from my fingers my mother's wedding ring and her silver thimble Go away she exclaimed and never come to my house again Her reproaches fell so hot and heavy that they left me no chance to answer Bitter tears such as the eyes never shed but once were my only answer I rose from my seat but fell back again sobbing She did not speak to me but the tears were running down her furrowed cheeks and they scorched me like fire She had always been so kind to me So kind How I longed to throw myself at her feet and tell her all the truth But she had ordered me to go and never to come there again After a few minutes I mustered strength and started to obey her With what feelings did I now close that little gate which I used to open with such an eager hand in my childhood It closed upon me with a sound I never heard before Where could I go I was afraid to return to my master's I walked on recklessly not caring where I went or what would become of me When I had gone four or five miles fatigue compelled me to stop I sat down on the stump of an old tree The stars were shining through the boughs above me How they mocked me with their bright calm light The hours passed by and as I sat there alone a chilliness and deadly sickness came over me I sank on the ground My mind was full of horrid thoughts I prayed to die but the prayer was not answered At last with great effort I roused myself and walked some distance further to the house of a woman who had been a friend of my mother When I told her why I was there she spoke soothingly to me but I could not be comforted I thought I could bear my shame if I could only be reconciled to my grandmother I longed to open my heart to her I thought if she could know the real state of the case and all I had been bearing for years she would perhaps judge me less harshly My friend advised me to send for her I did so but days of agonizing suspense passed before she came Had she utterly forsaken me No She came at last I knelt before her and told her the things that had poisoned my life how long I had been persecuted that I saw no way of escape and in an hour of extremity I had become desperate She listened in silence I told her I would bear any thing and do any thing if in time I had hopes of obtaining her forgiveness I begged of her to pity me for my dead mother's sake And she did pity me She did not say I forgive you but she looked at me lovingly with her eyes full of tears She laid her old hand gently on my head and murmured Poor child Poor child XI THE NEW TIE TO LIFE I RETURNED to my good grandmother's house She had an interview with Mr Sands When she asked him why he could not have left her one ewe lambwhether there were not plenty of slaves who did not care about characterhe made no answer but he spoke kind and encouraging words He promised to care for my child and to buy me be the conditions what they might I had not seen Dr Flint for five days I had never seen him since I made the avowal to him He talked of the disgrace I had brought on myself how I had sinned against my master and mortified my old grandmother He intimated that if I had accepted his proposals he as a physician could have saved me from exposure He even condescended to pity me Could he have offered wormwood more bitter He whose persecutions had been the cause of my sin Linda said he though you have been criminal towards me I feel for you and I can pardon you if you obey my wishes Tell me whether the fellow you wanted to marry is the father of your child If you deceive me you shall feel the fires of hell I did not feel as proud as I had done My strongest weapon with him was gone I was lowered in my own estimation and had resolved to bear his abuse in silence But when he spoke contemptuously of the lover who had always treated me honorably when I remembered that but for him I might have been a virtuous free and happy wife I lost my patience I have sinned against God and myself I replied but not against you He clinched his teeth and muttered Curse you He came towards me with ill-suppressed rage and exclaimed You obstinate girl I could grind your bones to powder You have thrown yourself away on some worthless rascal You are weak-minded and have been easily persuaded by those who don't care a straw for you The future will settle accounts between us You are blinded now but hereafter you will be convinced that your master was your best friend My lenity towards you is a proof of it I might have punished you in many ways I might have had you whipped till you fell dead under the lash But I wanted you to live I would have bettered your condition Others cannot do it You are my slave Your mistress disgusted by your conduct forbids you to return to the house therefore I leave you here for the present but I shall see you often I will call tomorrow He came with frowning brows that showed a dissatisfied state of mind After asking about my health he inquired whether my board was paid and who visited me He then went on to say that he had neglected his duty that as a physician there were certain things that he ought to have explained to me Then followed talk such as would have made the most shameless blush He ordered me to stand up before him I obeyed I command you said he to tell me whether the father of your child is white or black I hesitated Answer me this instant he exclaimed I did answer He sprang upon me like a wolf and grabbed my arm as if he would have broken it Do you love him said he in a hissing tone I am thankful that I do not despise him I replied He raised his hand to strike me but it fell again I don't know what arrested the blow He sat down with lips tightly compressed At last he spoke I came here said he to make you a friendly proposition but your ingratitude chafes me beyond endurance You turn aside all my good intentions towards you I don't know what it is that keeps me from killing you Again he rose as if he had a mind to strike me But he resumed On one condition I will forgive your insolence and crime You must henceforth have no communication of any kind with the father of your child You must not ask any thing from him or receive any thing from him I will take care of you and your child You had better promise this at once and not wait till you are deserted by him This is the last act of mercy I shall show towards you I said something about being unwilling to have my child supported by a man who had cursed it and me also He rejoined that a woman who had sunk to my level had no right to expect any thing else He asked for the last time would I accept his kindness I answered that I would not Very well said he then take the consequences of your wayward course Never look to me for help You are my slave and shall always be my slave I will never sell you that you may depend upon Hope died away in my heart as he closed the door after him I had calculated that in his rage he would sell me to a slave-trader and I knew the father of my child was on the watch to buy me About this time my uncle Phillip was expected to return from a voyage The day before his departure I had officiated as bridesmaid to a young friend My heart was then ill at ease but my smiling countenance did not betray it Only a year had passed but what fearful changes it had wrought My heart had grown gray in misery Lives that flash in sunshine and lives that are born in tears receive their hue from circumstances None of us know what a year may bring forth I felt no joy when they told me my uncle had come He wanted to see me though he knew what had happened I shrank from him at first but at last consented that he should come to my room He received me as he always had done O how my heart smote me when I felt his tears on my burning cheeks The words of my grandmother came to my mindPerhaps your mother and father are taken from the evil days to come My disappointed heart could now praise God that it was so But why thought I did my relatives ever cherish hopes for me What was there to save me from the usual fate of slave girls Many more beautiful and more intelligent than I had experienced a similar fate or a far worse one How could they hope that I should escape My uncle's stay was short and I was not sorry for it I was too ill in mind and body to enjoy my friends as I had done For some weeks I was unable to leave my bed I could not have any doctor but my master and I would not have him sent for At last alarmed by my increasing illness they sent for him I was very weak and nervous and as soon as he entered the room I began to scream They told him my state was very critical He had no wish to hasten me out of the world and he withdrew When my babe was born they said it was premature It weighed only four pounds but God let it live I heard the doctor say I could not survive till morning I had often prayed for death but now I did not want to die unless my child could die too Many weeks passed before I was able to leave my bed I was a mere wreck of my former self For a year there was scarcely a day when I was free from chills and fever My babe also was sickly His little limbs were often racked with pain Dr Flint continued his visits to look after my health and he did not fail to remind me that my child was an addition to his stock of slaves I felt too feeble to dispute with him and listened to his remarks in silence His visits were less frequent but his busy spirit could not remain quiet He employed my brother in his office and he was made the medium of frequent notes and messages to me William was a bright lad and of much use to the doctor He had learned to put up medicines to leech cup and bleed He had taught himself to read and spell I was proud of my brother and the old doctor suspected as much One day when I had not seen him for several weeks I heard his steps approaching the door I dreaded the encounter and hid myself He inquired for me of course but I was nowhere to be found He went to his office and despatched William with a note The color mounted to my brother's face when he gave it to me and he said Don't you hate me Linda for bringing you these things I told him I could not blame him he was a slave and obliged to obey his master's will The note ordered me to come to his office I went He demanded to know where I was when he called I told him I was at home He flew into a passion and said he knew better Then he launched out upon his usual themesmy crimes against him and my ingratitude for his forbearance The laws were laid down to me anew and I was dismissed I felt humiliated that my brother should stand by and listen to such language as would be addressed only to a slave Poor boy He was powerless to defend me but I saw the tears which he vainly strove to keep back This manifestation of feeling irritated the doctor William could do nothing to please him One morning he did not arrive at the office so early as usual and that circumstance afforded his master an opportunity to vent his spleen He was put in jail The next day my brother sent a trader to the doctor with a request to be sold His master was greatly incensed at what he called his insolence He said he had put him there to reflect upon his bad conduct and he certainly was not giving any evidence of repentance For two days he harassed himself to find somebody to do his office work but every thing went wrong without William He was released and ordered to take his old stand with many threats if he was not careful about his future behavior As the months passed on my boy improved in health When he was a year old they called him beautiful The little vine was taking deep root in my existence though its clinging fondness excited a mixture of love and pain When I was most sorely oppressed I found a solace in his smiles I loved to watch his infant slumbers but always there was a dark cloud over my enjoyment I could never forget that he was a slave Sometimes I wished that he might die in infancy God tried me My darling became very ill The bright eyes grew dull and the little feet and hands were so icy cold that I thought death had already touched them I had prayed for his death but never so earnestly as I now prayed for his life and my prayer was heard Alas what mockery it is for a slave mother to try to pray back her dying child to life Death is better than slavery It was a sad thought that I had no name to give my child His father caressed him and treated him kindly whenever he had a chance to see him He was not unwilling that he should bear his name but he had no legal claim to it and if I had bestowed it upon him my master would have regarded it as a new crime a new piece of insolence and would perhaps revenge it on the boy O the serpent of Slavery has many and poisonous fangs XII FEAR OF INSURRECTION NOT far from this time Nat Turner's insurrection broke out and the news threw our town into great commotion Strange that they should be alarmed when their slaves were so contented and happy But so it was It was always the custom to have a muster every year On that occasion every white man shouldered his musket The citizens and the so-called country gentlemen wore military uniforms The poor whites took their places in the ranks in every-day dress some without shoes some without hats This grand occasion had already passed and when the slaves were told there was to be another muster they were surprised and rejoiced Poor creatures They thought it was going to be a holiday I was informed of the true state of affairs and imparted it to the few I could trust Most gladly would I have proclaimed it to every slave but I dared not All could not be relied on Mighty is the power of the torturing lash By sunrise people were pouring in from every quarter within twenty miles of the town I knew the houses were to be searched and I expected it would be done by country bullies and the poor whites I knew nothing annoyed them so much as to see colored people living in comfort and respectability so I made arrangements for them with especial care I arranged every thing in my grandmother's house as neatly as possible I put white quilts on the beds and decorated some of the rooms with flowers When all was arranged I sat down at the window to watch Far as my eye could reach it rested on a motley crowd of soldiers Drums and fifes were discoursing martial music The men were divided into companies of sixteen each headed by a captain Orders were given and the wild scouts rushed in every direction wherever a colored face was to be found It was a grand opportunity for the low whites who had no negroes of their own to scourge They exulted in such a chance to exercise a little brief authority and show their subserviency to the slaveholders not reflecting that the power which trampled on the colored people also kept themselves in poverty ignorance and moral degradation Those who never witnessed such scenes can hardly believe what I know was inflicted at this time on innocent men women and children against whom there was not the slightest ground for suspicion Colored people and slaves who lived in remote parts of the town suffered in an especial manner In some cases the searchers scattered powder and shot among their clothes and then sent other parties to find them and bring them forward as proof that they were plotting insurrection Every where men women and children were whipped till the blood stood in puddles at their feet Some received five hundred lashes others were tied hands and feet and tortured with a bucking paddle which blisters the skin terribly The dwellings of the colored people unless they happened to be protected by some influential white person who was nigh at hand were robbed of clothing and every thing else the marauders thought worth carrying away All day long these unfeeling wretches went round like a troop of demons terrifying and tormenting the helpless At night they formed themselves into patrol bands and went wherever they chose among the colored people acting out their brutal will Many women hid themselves in woods and swamps to keep out of their way If any of the husbands or fathers told of these outrages they were tied up to the public whipping post and cruelly scourged for telling lies about white men The consternation was universal No two people that had the slightest tinge of color in their faces dared to be seen talking together I entertained no positive fears about our household because we were in the midst of white families who would protect us We were ready to receive the soldiers whenever they came It was not long before we heard the tramp of feet and the sound of voices The door was rudely pushed open and in they tumbled like a pack of hungry wolves They snatched at every thing within their reach Every box trunk closet and corner underwent a thorough examination A box in one of the drawers containing some silver change was eagerly pounced upon When I stepped forward to take it from them one of the soldiers turned and said angrily What d'ye foller us fur D'ye s'pose white folks is come to steal I replied You have come to search but you have searched that box and I will take it if you please At that moment I saw a white gentleman who was friendly to us and I called to him and asked him to have the goodness to come in and stay till the search was over He readily complied His entrance into the house brought in the captain of the company whose business it was to guard the outside of the house and see that none of the inmates left it This officer was Mr Litch the wealthy slaveholder whom I mentioned in the account of neighboring planters as being notorious for his cruelty He felt above soiling his hands with the search He merely gave orders and if a bit of writing was discovered it was carried to him by his ignorant followers who were unable to read My grandmother had a large trunk of bedding and table cloths When that was opened there was a great shout of surprise and one exclaimed Where'd the damned niggers git all dis sheet an' table clarf My grandmother emboldened by the presence of our white protector said You may be sure we didn't pilfer 'em from your houses Look here mammy said a grim-looking fellow without any coat you seem to feel mighty gran' 'cause you got all them 'ere fixens White folks oughter have 'em all His remarks were interrupted by a chorus of voices shouting We's got 'em We's got 'em Dis 'ere yaller gal's got letters There was a general rush for the supposed letter which upon examination proved to be some verses written to me by a friend In packing away my things I had overlooked them When their captain informed them of their contents they seemed much disappointed He inquired of me who wrote them I told him it was one of my friends Can you read them he asked When I told him I could he swore and raved and tore the paper into bits Bring me all your letters said he in a commanding tone I told him I had none Don't be afraid he continued in an insinuating way Bring them all to me Nobody shall do you any harm Seeing I did not move to obey him his pleasant tone changed to oaths and threats Who writes to you half free niggers inquired he I replied O no most of my letters are from white people Some request me to burn them after they are read and some I destroy without reading An exclamation of surprise from some of the company put a stop to our conversation Some silver spoons which ornamented an old-fashioned buffet had just been discovered My grandmother was in the habit of preserving fruit for many ladies in the town and of preparing suppers for parties consequently she had many jars of preserves The closet that contained these was next invaded and the contents tasted One of them who was helping himself freely tapped his neighbor on the shoulder and said Wal done Don't wonder de niggers want to kill all de white folks when dey live on 'sarves meaning preserves I stretched out my hand to take the jar saying You were not sent here to search for sweetmeats And what were we sent for said the captain bristling up to me I evaded the question The search of the house was completed and nothing found to condemn us They next proceeded to the garden and knocked about every bush and vine with no better success The captain called his men together and after a short consultation the order to march was given As they passed out of the gate the captain turned back and pronounced a malediction on the house He said it ought to be burned to the ground and each of its inmates receive thirty-nine lashes We came out of this affair very fortunately not losing any thing except some wearing apparel Towards evening the turbulence increased The soldiers stimulated by drink committed still greater cruelties Shrieks and shouts continually rent the air Not daring to go to the door I peeped under the window curtain I saw a mob dragging along a number of colored people each white man with his musket upraised threatening instant death if they did not stop their shrieks Among the prisoners was a respectable old colored minister They had found a few parcels of shot in his house which his wife had for years used to balance her scales For this they were going to shoot him on Court House Green What a spectacle was that for a civilized country A rabble staggering under intoxication assuming to be the administrators of justice The better class of the community exerted their influence to save the innocent persecuted people and in several instances they succeeded by keeping them shut up in jail till the excitement abated At last the white citizens found that their own property was not safe from the lawless rabble they had summoned to protect them They rallied the drunken swarm drove them back into the country and set a guard over the town The next day the town patrols were commissioned to search colored people that lived out of the city and the most shocking outrages were committed with perfect impunity Every day for a fortnight if I looked out I saw horsemen with some poor panting negro tied to their saddles and compelled by the lash to keep up with their speed till they arrived at the jail yard Those who had been whipped too unmercifully to walk were washed with brine tossed into a cart and carried to jail One black man who had not fortitude to endure scourging promised to give information about the conspiracy But it turned out that he knew nothing at all He had not even heard the name of Nat Turner The poor fellow had however made up a story which augmented his own sufferings and those of the colored people The day patrol continued for some weeks and at sundown a night guard was substituted Nothing at all was proved against the colored people bond or free The wrath of the slaveholders was somewhat appeased by the capture of Nat Turner The imprisoned were released The slaves were sent to their masters and the free were permitted to return to their ravaged homes Visiting was strictly forbidden on the plantations The slaves begged the privilege of again meeting at their little church in the woods with their burying ground around it It was built by the colored people and they had no higher happiness than to meet there and sing hymns together and pour out their hearts in spontaneous prayer Their request was denied and the church was demolished They were permitted to attend the white churches a certain portion of the galleries being appropriated to their use There when every body else had partaken of the communion and the benediction had been pronounced the minister said Come down now my colored friends They obeyed the summons and partook of the bread and wine in commemoration of the meek and lowly Jesus who said God is your Father and all ye are brethren XIII THE CHURCH AND SLAVERY AFTER the alarm caused by Nat Turner's insurrection had subsided the slaveholders came to the conclusion that it would be well to give the slaves enough of religious instruction to keep them from murdering their masters The Episcopal clergyman offered to hold a separate service on Sundays for their benefit His colored members were very few and also very respectablea fact which I presume had some weight with him The difficulty was to decide on a suitable place for them to worship The Methodist and Baptist churches admitted them in the afternoon but their carpets and cushions were not so costly as those at the Episcopal church It was at last decided that they should meet at the house of a free colored man who was a member I was invited to attend because I could read Sunday evening came and trusting to the cover of night I ventured out I rarely ventured out by daylight for I always went with fear expecting at every turn to encounter Dr Flint who was sure to turn me back or order me to his office to inquire where I got my bonnet or some other article of dress When the Rev Mr Pike came there were some twenty persons present The reverend gentleman knelt in prayer then seated himself and requested all present who could read to open their books while he gave out the portions he wished them to repeat or respond to His text was Servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto Christ Pious Mr Pike brushed up his hair till it stood upright and in deep solemn tones began Hearken ye servants Give strict heed unto my words You are rebellious sinners Your hearts are filled with all manner of evil 'Tis the devil who tempts you God is angry with you and will surely punish you if you don't forsake your wicked ways You that live in town are eye-servants behind your master's back Instead of serving your masters faithfully which is pleasing in the sight of your heavenly Master you are idle and shirk your work God sees you You tell lies God hears you Instead of being engaged in worshipping him you are hidden away somewhere feasting on your master's substance tossing coffee-grounds with some wicked fortuneteller or cutting cards with another old hag Your masters may not find you out but God sees you and will punish you O the depravity of your hearts When your master's work is done are you quietly together thinking of the goodness of God to such sinful creatures No you are quarrelling and tying up little bags of roots to bury under the door-steps to poison each other with God sees you You men steal away to every grog shop to sell your master's corn that you may buy rum to drink God sees you You sneak into the back streets or among the bushes to pitch coppers Although your masters may not find you out God sees you and he will punish you You must forsake your sinful ways and be faithful servants Obey your old master and your young masteryour old mistress and your young mistress If you disobey your earthly master you offend your heavenly Master You must obey God's commandments When you go from here don't stop at the corners of the streets to talk but go directly home and let your master and mistress see that you have come The benediction was pronounced We went home highly amused at brother Pike's gospel teaching and we determined to hear him again I went the next Sabbath evening and heard pretty much a repetition of the last discourse At the close of the meeting Mr Pike informed us that he found it very inconvenient to meet at the friend's house and he should be glad to see us every Sunday evening at his own kitchen I went home with the feeling that I had heard the Reverend Mr Pike for the last time Some of his members repaired to his house and found that the kitchen sported two tallow candles the first time I am sure since its present occupant owned it for the servants never had any thing but pine knots It was so long before the reverend gentleman descended from his comfortable parlor that the slaves left and went to enjoy a Methodist shout They never seem so happy as when shouting and singing at religious meetings Many of them are sincere and nearer to the gate of heaven than sanctimonious Mr Pike and other long-faced Christians who see wounded Samaritans and pass by on the other side The slaves generally compose their own songs and hymns and they do not trouble their heads much about the measure They often sing the following verses Old Satan is one busy ole man He rolls dem blocks all in my way But Jesus is my bosom friend He rolls dem blocks away If I had died when I was young Den how my stam'ring tongue would have sung But I am ole and now I stand A narrow chance for to tread dat heavenly land I well remember one occasion when I attended a Methodist class meeting I went with a burdened spirit and happened to sit next a poor bereaved mother whose heart was still heavier than mine The class leader was the town constablea man who bought and sold slaves who whipped his brethren and sisters of the church at the public whipping post in jail or out of jail He was ready to perform that Christian office any where for fifty cents This white-faced black-hearted brother came near us and said to the stricken woman Sister can't you tell us how the Lord deals with your soul Do you love him as you did formerly She rose to her feet and said in piteous tones My Lord and Master help me My load is more than I can bear God has hid himself from me and I am left in darkness and misery Then striking her breast she continued I can't tell you what is in here They've got all my children Last week they took the last one God only knows where they've sold her They let me have her sixteen years and thenO O Pray for her brothers and sisters I've got nothing to live for now God make my time short She sat down quivering in every limb I saw that constable class leader become crimson in the face with suppressed laughter while he held up his handkerchief that those who were weeping for the poor woman's calamity might not see his merriment Then with assumed gravity he said to the bereaved mother Sister pray to the Lord that every dispensation of his divine will may be sanctified to the good of your poor needy soul The congregation struck up a hymn and sung as though they were as free as the birds that warbled round us Ole Satan thought he had a mighty aim He missed my soul and caught my sins Cry Amen cry Amen cry Amen to God He took my sins upon his back Went muttering and grumbling down to hell Cry Amen cry Amen cry Amen to God Ole Satan's church is here below Up to God's free church I hope to go Cry Amen cry Amen cry Amen to God Precious are such moments to the poor slaves If you were to hear them at such times you might think they were happy But can that hour of singing and shouting sustain them through the dreary week toiling without wages under constant dread of the lash The Episcopal clergyman who ever since my earliest recollection had been a sort of god among the slaveholders concluded as his family was large that he must go where money was more abundant A very different clergyman took his place The change was very agreeable to the colored people who said God has sent us a good man this time They loved him and their children followed him for a smile or a kind word Even the slaveholders felt his influence He brought to the rectory five slaves His wife taught them to read and write and to be useful to her and themselves As soon as he was settled he turned his attention to the needy slaves around him He urged upon his parishioners the duty of having a meeting expressly for them every Sunday with a sermon adapted to their comprehension After much argument and importunity it was finally agreed that they might occupy the gallery of the church on Sunday evenings Many colored people hitherto unaccustomed to attend church now gladly went to hear the gospel preached The sermons were simple and they understood them Moreover it was the first time they had ever been addressed as human beings It was not long before his white parishioners began to be dissatisfied He was accused of preaching better sermons to the negroes than he did to them He honestly confessed that he bestowed more pains upon those sermons than upon any others for the slaves were reared in such ignorance that it was a difficult task to adapt himself to their comprehension Dissensions arose in the parish Some wanted he should preach to them in the evening and to the slaves in the afternoon In the midst of these disputings his wife died after a very short illness Her slaves gathered round her dying bed in great sorrow She said I have tried to do you good and promote your happiness and if I have failed it has not been for want of interest in your welfare Do not weep for me but prepare for the new duties that lie before you I leave you all free May we meet in a better world Her liberated slaves were sent away with funds to establish them comfortably The colored people will long bless the memory of that truly Christian woman Soon after her death her husband preached his farewell sermon and many tears were shed at his departure Several years after he passed through our town and preached to his former congregation In his afternoon sermon he addressed the colored people My friends said he it affords me great happiness to have an opportunity of speaking to you again For two years I have been striving to do something for the colored people of my own parish but nothing is yet accomplished I have not even preached a sermon to them Try to live according to the word of God my friends Your skin is darker than mine but God judges men by their hearts not by the color of their skins This was strange doctrine from a southern pulpit It was very offensive to slaveholders They said he and his wife had made fools of their slaves and that he preached like a fool to the negroes I knew an old black man whose piety and childlike trust in God were beautiful to witness At fifty-three years old he joined the Baptist church He had a most earnest desire to learn to read He thought he should know how to serve God better if he could only read the Bible He came to me and begged me to teach him He said he could not pay me for he had no money but he would bring me nice fruit when the season for it came I asked him if he didn't know it was contrary to law and that slaves were whipped and imprisoned for teaching each other to read This brought the tears into his eyes Don't be troubled uncle Fred said I I have no thoughts of refusing to teach you I only told you of the law that you might know the danger and be on your guard He thought he could plan to come three times a week without its being suspected I selected a quiet nook where no intruder was likely to penetrate and there I taught him his A B and C Considering his age his progress was astonishing As soon as he could spell in two syllables he wanted to spell out words in the Bible The happy smile that illuminated his face put joy into my heart After spelling out a few words he paused and said Honey it 'pears when I can read dis good book I shall be nearer to God White man is got all de sense He can larn easy It ain't easy for ole black man like me I only wants to read dis book dat I may know how to live den I hab no fear 'bout dying I tried to encourage him by speaking of the rapid progress he had made Hab patience child he replied I larns slow I had no need of patience His gratitude and the happiness I imparted were more than a recompense for all my trouble At the end of six months he had read through the New Testament and could find any text in it One day when he had recited unusually well I said Uncle Fred how do you manage to get your lessons so well Lord bress you chile he replied You nebber gibs me a lesson dat I don't pray to God to help me to understan' what I spells and what I reads And he does help me chile Bress his holy name There are thousands who like good uncle Fred are thirsting for the water of life but the law forbids it and the churches withhold it They send the Bible to heathen abroad and neglect the heathen at home I am glad that missionaries go out to the dark corners of the earth but I ask them not to overlook the dark corners at home Talk to American slaveholders as you talk to savages in Africa Tell them it is wrong to traffic in men Tell them it is sinful to sell their own children and atrocious to violate their own daughters Tell them that all men are brethren and that man has no right to shut out the light of knowledge from his brother Tell them they are answerable to God for sealing up the Fountain of Life from souls that are thirsting for it There are men who would gladly undertake such missionary work as this but alas their number is small They are hated by the south and would be driven from its soil or dragged to prison to die as others have been before them The field is ripe for the harvest and awaits the reapers Perhaps the great grandchildren of uncle Fred may have freely imparted to them the divine treasures which he sought by stealth at the risk of the prison and the scourge Are doctors of divinity blind or are they hypocrites I suppose some are the one and some the other but I think if they felt the interest in the poor and the lowly that they ought to feel they would not be so easily blinded A clergyman who goes to the south for the first time has usually some feeling however vague that slavery is wrong The slaveholder suspects this and plays his game accordingly He makes himself as agreeable as possible talks on theology and other kindred topics The reverend gentleman is asked to invoke a blessing on a table loaded with luxuries After dinner he walks round the premises and sees the beautiful groves and flowering vines and the comfortable huts of favored household slaves The southerner invites him to talk with these slaves He asks them if they want to be free and they say O no massa This is sufficient to satisfy him He comes home to publish a South-Side View of Slavery and to complain of the exaggerations of abolitionists He assures people that he has been to the south and seen slavery for himself that it is a beautiful patriarchal institution that the slaves don't want their freedom that they have hallelujah meetings and other religious privileges What does he know of the half-starved wretches toiling from dawn till dark on the plantations of mothers shrieking for their children torn from their arms by slave traders of young girls dragged down into moral filth of pools of blood around the whipping post of hounds trained to tear human flesh of men screwed into cotton gins to die The slaveholder showed him none of these things and the slaves dared not tell of them if he had asked them There is a great difference between Christianity and religion at the south If a man goes to the communion table and pays money into the treasury of the church no matter if it be the price of blood he is called religious If a pastor has offspring by a woman not his wife the church dismiss him if she is a white woman but if she is colored it does not hinder his continuing to be their good shepherd When I was told that Dr Flint had joined the Episcopal church I was much surprised I supposed that religion had a purifying effect on the character of men but the worst persecutions I endured from him were after he was a communicant The conversation of the doctor the day after he had been confirmed certainly gave me no indication that he had renounced the devil and all his works In answer to some of his usual talk I reminded him that he had just joined the church Yes Linda said he It was proper for me to do so I am getting in years and my position in society requires it and it puts an end to all the damned slang You would do well to join the church too Linda There are sinners enough in it already rejoined I If I could be allowed to live like a Christian I should be glad You can do what I require and if you are faithful to me you will be as virtuous as my wife he replied I answered that the Bible didn't say so His voice became hoarse with rage How dare you preach to me about your infernal Bible he exclaimed What right have you who are my negro to talk to me about what you would like and what you wouldn't like I am your master and you shall obey me No wonder the slaves sing Ole Satan's church is here below Up to God's free church I hope to go XIV ANOTHER LINK TO LIFE I HAD not returned to my master's house since the birth of my child The old man raved to have me thus removed from his immediate power but his wife vowed by all that was good and great she would kill me if I came back and he did not doubt her word Sometimes he would stay away for a season Then he would come and renew the old threadbare discourse about his forbearance and my ingratitude He labored most unnecessarily to convince me that I had lowered myself The venomous old reprobate had no need of descanting on that theme I felt humiliated enough My unconscious babe was the ever-present witness of my shame I listened with silent contempt when he talked about my having forfeited his good opinion but I shed bitter tears that I was no longer worthy of being respected by the good and pure Alas slavery still held me in its poisonous grasp There was no chance for me to be respectable There was no prospect of being able to lead a better life Sometimes when my master found that I still refused to accept what he called his kind offers he would threaten to sell my child Perhaps that will humble you said he Humble me Was I not already in the dust But his threat lacerated my heart I knew the law gave him power to fulfil it for slaveholders have been cunning enough to enact that the child shall follow the condition of the mother not of the father thus taking care that licentiousness shall not interfere with avarice This reflection made me clasp my innocent babe all the more firmly to my heart Horrid visions passed through my mind when I thought of his liability to fall into the slave trader's hands I wept over him and said O my child perhaps they will leave you in some cold cabin to die and then throw you into a hole as if you were a dog When Dr Flint learned that I was again to be a mother he was exasperated beyond measure He rushed from the house and returned with a pair of shears I had a fine head of hair and he often railed about my pride of arranging it nicely He cut every hair close to my head storming and swearing all the time I replied to some of his abuse and he struck me Some months before he had pitched me down stairs in a fit of passion and the injury I received was so serious that I was unable to turn myself in bed for many days He then said Linda I swear by God I will never raise my hand against you again but I knew that he would forget his promise After he discovered my situation he was like a restless spirit from the pit He came every day and I was subjected to such insults as no pen can describe I would not describe them if I could they were too low too revolting I tried to keep them from my grandmother's knowledge as much as I could I knew she had enough to sadden her life without having my troubles to bear When she saw the doctor treat me with violence and heard him utter oaths terrible enough to palsy a man's tongue she could not always hold her peace It was natural and motherlike that she should try to defend me but it only made matters worse When they told me my new-born babe was a girl my heart was heavier than it had ever been before Slavery is terrible for men but it is far more terrible for women Superadded to the burden common to all they have wrongs and sufferings and mortifications peculiarly their own Dr Flint had sworn that he would make me suffer to my last day for this new crime against him as he called it and as long as he had me in his power he kept his word On the fourth day after the birth of my babe he entered my room suddenly and commanded me to rise and bring my baby to him The nurse who took care of me had gone out of the room to prepare some nourishment and I was alone There was no alternative I rose took up my babe and crossed the room to where he sat Now stand there said he till I tell you to go back My child bore a strong resemblance to her father and to the deceased Mrs Sands her grandmother He noticed this and while I stood before him trembling with weakness he heaped upon me and my little one every vile epithet he could think of Even the grandmother in her grave did not escape his curses In the midst of his vituperations I fainted at his feet This recalled him to his senses He took the baby from my arms laid it on the bed dashed cold water on my face took me up and shook me violently to restore my consciousness before any one entered the room Just then my grandmother came in and he hurried out of the house I suffered in consequence of this treatment but I begged my friends to let me die rather than send for the doctor There was nothing I dreaded so much as his presence My life was spared and I was glad for the sake of my little ones Had it not been for these ties to life I should have been glad to be released by death though I had lived only nineteen years Always it gave me a pang that my children had no lawful claim to a name Their father offered his but if I had wished to accept the offer I dared not while my master lived Moreover I knew it would not be accepted at their baptism A Christian name they were at least entitled to and we resolved to call my boy for our dear good Benjamin who had gone far away from us My grandmother belonged to the church and she was very desirous of having the children christened I knew Dr Flint would forbid it and I did not venture to attempt it But chance favored me He was called to visit a patient out of town and was obliged to be absent during Sunday Now is the time said my grandmother we will take the children to church and have them christened When I entered the church recollections of my mother came over me and I felt subdued in spirit There she had presented me for baptism without any reason to feel ashamed She had been married and had such legal rights as slavery allows to a slave The vows had at least been sacred to her and she had never violated them I was glad she was not alive to know under what different circumstances her grandchildren were presented for baptism Why had my lot been so different from my mother's Her master had died when she was a child and she remained with her mistress till she married She was never in the power of any master and thus she escaped one class of the evils that generally fall upon slaves When my baby was about to be christened the former mistress of my father stepped up to me and proposed to give it her Christian name To this I added the surname of my father who had himself no legal right to it for my grandfather on the paternal side was a white gentleman What tangled skeins are the genealogies of slavery I loved my father but it mortified me to be obliged to bestow his name on my children When we left the church my father's old mistress invited me to go home with her She clasped a gold chain round my baby's neck I thanked her for this kindness but I did not like the emblem I wanted no chain to be fastened on my daughter not even if its links were of gold How earnestly I prayed that she might never feel the weight of slavery's chain whose iron entereth into the soul XV CONTINUED PERSECUTIONS MY children grew finely and Dr Flint would often say to me with an exulting smile These brats will bring me a handsome sum of money one of these days I thought to myself that God being my helper they should never pass into his hands It seemed to me I would rather see them killed than have them given up to his power The money for the freedom of myself and my children could be obtained but I derived no advantage from that circumstance Dr Flint loved money but he loved power more After much discussion my friends resolved on making another trial There was a slaveholder about to leave for Texas and he was commissioned to buy me He was to begin with nine hundred dollars and go up to twelve My master refused his offers Sir said he she don't belong to me She is my daughter's property and I have no right to sell her I mistrust that you come from her paramour If so you may tell him that he cannot buy her for any money neither can he buy her children The doctor came to see me the next day and my heart beat quicker as he entered I never had seen the old man tread with so majestic a step He seated himself and looked at me with withering scorn My children had learned to be afraid of him The little one would shut her eyes and hide her face on my shoulder whenever she saw him and Benny who was now nearly five years old often inquired What makes that bad man come here so many times Does he want to hurt us I would clasp the dear boy in my arms trusting that he would be free before he was old enough to solve the problem And now as the doctor sat there so grim and silent the child left his play and came and nestled up by me At last my tormentor spoke So you are left in disgust are you said he It is no more than I expected You remember I told you years ago that you would be treated so So he is tired of you Ha ha ha The virtuous madam don't like to hear about it does she Ha ha ha There was a sting in his calling me virtuous madam I no longer had the power of answering him as I had formerly done He continued So it seems you are trying to get up another intrigue Your new paramour came to me and offered to buy you but you may be assured you will not succeed You are mine and you shall be mine for life There lives no human being that can take you out of slavery I would have done it but you rejected my kind offer I told him I did not wish to get up any intrigue that I had never seen the man who offered to buy me Do you tell me I lie exclaimed he dragging me from my chair Will you say again that you never saw that man I answered I do say so He clinched my arm with a volley of oaths Ben began to scream I told him to go to his grandmother Don't you stir a step you wretch said he The child drew nearer to me and put his arms round me as if he wanted to protect me This was too much for my enraged master He caught him up and hurled him across the room I thought he was dead and rushed towards him to take him up Not yet exclaimed the doctor Let him lie there till he comes to Let me go Let me go I screamed or I will raise the whole house I struggled and got away but he clinched me again Somebody opened the door and he released me I picked up my insensible child and when I turned my tormentor was gone Anxiously I bent over the little form so pale and still and when the brown eyes at last opened I don't know whether I was very happy All the doctor's former persecutions were renewed He came morning noon and night No jealous lover ever watched a rival more closely than he watched me and the unknown slaveholder with whom he accused me of wishing to get up an intrigue When my grandmother was out of the way he searched every room to find him In one of his visits he happened to find a young girl whom he had sold to a trader a few days previous His statement was that he sold her because she had been too familiar with the overseer She had had a bitter life with him and was glad to be sold She had no mother and no near ties She had been torn from all her family years before A few friends had entered into bonds for her safety if the trader would allow her to spend with them the time that intervened between her sale and the gathering up of his human stock Such a favor was rarely granted It saved the trader the expense of board and jail fees and though the amount was small it was a weighty consideration in a slave-trader's mind Dr Flint always had an aversion to meeting slaves after he had sold them He ordered Rose out of the house but he was no longer her master and she took no notice of him For once the crushed Rose was the conqueror His gray eyes flashed angrily upon her but that was the extent of his power How came this girl here he exclaimed What right had you to allow it when you knew I had sold her I answered This is my grandmother's house and Rose came to see her I have no right to turn any body out of doors that comes here for honest purposes He gave me the blow that would have fallen upon Rose if she had still been his slave My grandmother's attention had been attracted by loud voices and she arrived in time to see a second blow dealt She was not a woman to let such an outrage in her own house go unrebuked The doctor undertook to explain that I had been insolent Her indignant feelings rose higher and higher and finally boiled over in words Get out of my house she exclaimed Go home and take care of your wife and children and you will have enough to do without watching my family He threw the birth of my children in her face and accused her of sanctioning the life I was leading She told him I was living with her by compulsion of his wife that he needn't accuse her for he was the one to blame he was the one who had caused all the trouble She grew more and more excited as she went on I tell you what Dr Flint said she you ain't got many more years to live and you'd better be saying your prayers It will take 'em all and more too to wash the dirt off your soul Do you know whom you are talking to he exclaimed She replied Yes I know very well who I am talking to He left the house in a great rage I looked at my grandmother Our eyes met Their angry expression had passed away but she looked sorrowful and wearyweary of incessant strife I wondered that it did not lessen her love for me but if it did she never showed it She was always kind always ready to sympathize with my troubles There might have been peace and contentment in that lovable home if it had not been for the demon Slavery The winter passed undisturbed by the doctor The beautiful spring came and when Nature resumes her loveliness the human soul is apt to revive also My drooping hopes came to life again with the flowers I was dreaming of freedom again more for my children's sake than my own I planned and I planned Obstacles hit against plans There seemed no way of overcoming them and yet I hoped Back came the wily doctor I was not at home when he called A friend had invited me to a small party and to gratify her I went To my great consternation a messenger came in haste to say that Dr Flint was at my grandmother's and insisted on seeing me They did not tell him where I was or he would have come and raised a disturbance in my friend's house They sent me a dark wrapper I threw it on and hurried home My speed did not save me the doctor had gone away in anger I dreaded the morning but I could not delay it it came warm and bright At an early hour the doctor came and asked me where I had been last night I told him He did not believe me and sent to my friend's house to ascertain the facts He came in the afternoon to assure me he was satisfied that I had spoken the truth He seemed to be in a facetious mood and I expected some jeers were coming I suppose you need some recreation said he but I am surprised at your being there among those negroes It was not the place for you Are you allowed to visit such people I understood this covert fling at the white gentleman who was my friend but I merely replied I went to visit my friends and any company they keep is good enough for me He went on to say I have seen very little of you of late but my interest in you is unchanged When I said I would have no more mercy on you I was rash I recall my words Linda you desire freedom for yourself and your children and you can obtain it only through me If you agree to what I am about to propose you and they shall be free There must be no communication of any kind between you and their father I will procure a cottage where you and the children can live together Your labor shall be light such as sewing for my family Think what is offered you Lindaa home and freedom Let the past be forgotten If I have been harsh with you at times your wilfulness drove me to it You know I exact obedience from my own children and I consider you as yet a child He paused for an answer but I remained silent Why don't you speak said he What more do you wait for Nothing sir Then you accept my offer No sir His anger was ready to break loose but he succeeded in curbing it and replied You have answered without thought But I must let you know there are two sides to my proposition if you reject the bright side you will be obliged to take the dark one You must either accept my offer or you and your children shall be sent to your young master's plantation there to remain till your young mistress is married and your children shall fare like the rest of the negro children I give you a week to consider of it He was shrewd but I knew he was not to be trusted I told him I was ready to give my answer now I will not receive it now he replied You act too much from impulse Remember that you and your children can be free a week from to-day if you choose On what a monstrous chance hung the destiny of my children I knew that my master's offer was a snare and that if I entered it escape would be impossible As for his promise I knew him so well that I was sure if he gave me free papers they would be so managed as to have no legal value The alternative was inevitable I resolved to go to the plantation But then I thought how completely I should be in his power and the prospect was apalling Even if I should kneel before him and implore him to spare me for the sake of my children I knew he would spurn me with his foot and my weakness would be his triumph Before the week expired I heard that young Mr Flint was about to be married to a lady of his own stamp I foresaw the position I should occupy in his establishment I had once been sent to the plantation for punishment and fear of the son had induced the father to recall me very soon My mind was made up I was resolved that I would foil my master and save my children or I would perish in the attempt I kept my plans to myself I knew that friends would try to dissuade me from them and I would not wound their feelings by rejecting their advice On the decisive day the doctor came and said he hoped I had made a wise choice I am ready to go to the plantation sir I replied Have you thought how important your decision is to your children said he I told him I had Very well Go to the plantation and my curse go with you he replied Your boy shall be put to work and he shall soon be sold and your girl shall be raised for the purpose of selling well Go your own ways He left the room with curses not to be repeated As I stood rooted to the spot my grandmother came and said Linda child what did you tell him I answered that I was going to the plantation Must you go said she Can't something be done to stop it I told her it was useless to try but she begged me not to give up She said she would go to the doctor and remind him how long and how faithfully she had served in the family and how she had taken her own baby from her breast to nourish his wife She would tell him I had been out of the family so long they would not miss me that she would pay them for my time and the money would procure a woman who had more strength for the situation than I had I begged her not to go but she persisted in saying He will listen to me Linda She went and was treated as I expected He coolly listened to what she said but denied her request He told her that what he did was for my good that my feelings were entirely above my situation and that on the plantation I would receive treatment that was suitable to my behavior My grandmother was much cast down I had my secret hopes but I must fight my battle alone I had a woman's pride and a mother's love for my children and I resolved that out of the darkness of this hour a brighter dawn should rise for them My master had power and law on his side I had a determined will There is might in each XVI SCENES AT THE PLANTATION EARLY the next morning I left my grandmother's with my youngest child My boy was ill and I left him behind I had many sad thoughts as the old wagon jolted on Hitherto I had suffered alone now my little one was to be treated as a slave As we drew near the great house I thought of the time when I was formerly sent there out of revenge I wondered for what purpose I was now sent I could not tell I resolved to obey orders so far as duty required but within myself I determined to make my stay as short as possible Mr Flint was waiting to receive us and told me to follow him up stairs to receive orders for the day My little Ellen was left below in the kitchen It was a change for her who had always been so carefully tended My young master said she might amuse herself in the yard This was kind of him since the child was hateful to his sight My task was to fit up the house for the reception of the bride In the midst of sheets tablecloths towels drapery and carpeting my head was as busy planning as were my fingers with the needle At noon I was allowed to go to Ellen She had sobbed herself to sleep I heard Mr Flint say to a neighbor I've got her down here and I'll soon take the town notions out of her head My father is partly to blame for her nonsense He ought to have broke her in long ago The remark was made within my hearing and it would have been quite as manly to have made it to my face He had said things to my face which might or might not have surprised his neighbor if he had known of them He was a chip of the old block I resolved to give him no cause to accuse me of being too much of a lady so far as work was concerned I worked day and night with wretchedness before me When I lay down beside my child I felt how much easier it would be to see her die than to see her master beat her about as I daily saw him beat other little ones The spirit of the mothers was so crushed by the lash that they stood by without courage to remonstrate How much more must I suffer before I should be broke in to that degree I wished to appear as contented as possible Sometimes I had an opportunity to send a few lines home and this brought up recollections that made it difficult for a time to seem calm and indifferent to my lot Notwithstanding my efforts I saw that Mr Flint regarded me with a suspicious eye Ellen broke down under the trials of her new life Separated from me with no one to look after her she wandered about and in a few days cried herself sick One day she sat under the window where I was at work crying that weary cry which makes a mother's heart bleed I was obliged to steel myself to bear it After a while it ceased I looked out and she was gone As it was near noon I ventured to go down in search of her The great house was raised two feet above the ground I looked under it and saw her about midway fast asleep I crept under and drew her out As I held her in my arms I thought how well it would be for her if she never waked up and I uttered my thought aloud I was startled to hear some one say Did you speak to me I looked up and saw Mr Flint standing beside me He said nothing further but turned frowning away That night he sent Ellen a biscuit and a cup of sweetened milk This generosity surprised me I learned afterwards that in the afternoon he had killed a large snake which crept from under the house and I supposed that incident had prompted his unusual kindness The next morning the old cart was loaded with shingles for town I put Ellen into it and sent her to her grandmother Mr Flint said I ought to have asked his permission I told him the child was sick and required attention which I had no time to give He let it pass for he was aware that I had accomplished much work in a little time I had been three weeks on the plantation when I planned a visit home It must be at night after every body was in bed I was six miles from town and the road was very dreary I was to go with a young man who I knew often stole to town to see his mother One night when all was quiet we started Fear gave speed to our steps and we were not long in performing the journey I arrived at my grandmother's Her bed room was on the first floor and the window was open the weather being warm I spoke to her and she awoke She let me in and closed the window lest some late passer-by should see me A light was brought and the whole household gathered round me some smiling and some crying I went to look at my children and thanked God for their happy sleep The tears fell as I leaned over them As I moved to leave Benny stirred I turned back and whispered Mother is here After digging at his eyes with his little fist they opened and he sat up in bed looking at me curiously Having satisfied himself that it was I he exclaimed O mother you ain't dead are you They didn't cut off your head at the plantation did they My time was up too soon and my guide was waiting for me I laid Benny back in his bed and dried his tears by a promise to come again soon Rapidly we retraced our steps back to the plantation About half way we were met by a company of four patrols Luckily we heard their horse's hoofs before they came in sight and we had time to hide behind a large tree They passed hallooing and shouting in a manner that indicated a recent carousal How thankful we were that they had not their dogs with them We hastened our footsteps and when we arrived on the plantation we heard the sound of the hand-mill The slaves were grinding their corn We were safely in the house before the horn summoned them to their labor I divided my little parcel of food with my guide knowing that he had lost the chance of grinding his corn and must toil all day in the field Mr Flint often took an inspection of the house to see that no one was idle The entire management of the work was trusted to me because he knew nothing about it and rather than hire a superintendent he contented himself with my arrangements He had often urged upon his father the necessity of having me at the plantation to take charge of his affairs and make clothes for the slaves but the old man knew him too well to consent to that arrangement When I had been working a month at the plantation the great aunt of Mr Flint came to make him a visit This was the good old lady who paid fifty dollars for my grandmother for the purpose of making her free when she stood on the auction block My grandmother loved this old lady whom we all called Miss Fanny She often came to take tea with us On such occasions the table was spread with a snow-white cloth and the china cups and silver spoons were taken from the old-fashioned buffet There were hot muffins tea rusks and delicious sweetmeats My grandmother kept two cows and the fresh cream was Miss Fanny's delight She invariably declared that it was the best in town The old ladies had cosey times together They would work and chat and sometimes while talking over old times their spectacles would get dim with tears and would have to be taken off and wiped When Miss Fanny bade us good by her bag was filled with grandmother's best cakes and she was urged to come again soon There had been a time when Dr Flint's wife came to take tea with us and when her children were also sent to have a feast of Aunt Marthy's nice cooking But after I became an object of her jealousy and spite she was angry with grandmother for giving a shelter to me and my children She would not even speak to her in the street This wounded my grandmother's feelings for she could not retain ill will against the woman whom she had nourished with her milk when a babe The doctor's wife would gladly have prevented our intercourse with Miss Fanny if she could have done it but fortunately she was not dependent on the bounty of the Flints She had enough to be independent and that is more than can ever be gained from charity however lavish it may be Miss Fanny was endeared to me by many recollections and I was rejoiced to see her at the plantation The warmth of her large loyal heart made the house seem pleasanter while she was in it She staid a week and I had many talks with her She said her principal object in coming was to see how I was treated and whether any thing could be done for me She inquired whether she could help me in any way I told her I believed not She condoled with me in her own peculiar way saying she wished that I and all my grandmother's family were at rest in our graves for not until then should she feel any peace about us The good old soul did not dream that I was planning to bestow peace upon her with regard to myself and my children not by death but by securing our freedom Again and again I had traversed those dreary twelve miles to and from the town and all the way I was meditating upon some means of escape for myself and my children My friends had made every effort that ingenuity could devise to effect our purchase but all their plans had proved abortive Dr Flint was suspicious and determined not to loosen his grasp upon us I could have made my escape alone but it was more for my helpless children than for myself that I longed for freedom Though the boon would have been precious to me above all price I would not have taken it at the expense of leaving them in slavery Every trial I endured every sacrifice I made for their sakes drew them closer to my heart and gave me fresh courage to beat back the dark waves that rolled and rolled over me in a seemingly endless night of storms The six weeks were nearly completed when Mr Flint's bride was expected to take possession of her own home The arrangements were all completed and Mr Flint said I had done well He expected to leave home on Saturday and return with his bride the following Wednesday After receiving various orders from him I ventured to ask permission to spend Sunday in town It was granted for which favor I was thankful It was the first I had ever asked of him and I intended it should be the last It needed more than one night to accomplish the project I had in view but the whole of Sunday would give me an opportunity I spent the Sabbath with my grandmother A calmer more beautiful day never came down out of heaven To me it was a day of conflicting emotions Perhaps it was the last day I should ever spend under that dear old sheltered roof Perhaps these were the last talks I should ever have with the faithful old friend of my whole life Perhaps it was the last time I and my children should be together Well better so I thought than that they should be slaves I knew the doom that awaited my fair baby in slavery and I determined to save her from it or perish in the attempt I went to make this vow at the graves of my poor parents in the burying-ground of the slaves There the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary be at rest There the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice of the oppressor the servant is free from his master I knelt by the graves of my parents and thanked God as I had often done before that they had not lived to witness my trials or to mourn over my sins I had received my mother's blessing when she died and in many an hour of tribulation I had seemed to hear her voice sometimes chiding me sometimes whispering loving words into my wounded heart I have shed many and bitter tears to think that when I am gone from my children they cannot remember me with such entire satisfaction as I remembered my mother The graveyard was in the woods and twilight was coming on Nothing broke the death-like stillness except the occasional twitter of a bird My spirit was overawed by the solemnity of the scene For more than ten years I had frequented this spot but never had it seemed to me so sacred as now A black stump at the head of my mother's grave was all that remained of a tree my father had planted His grave was marked by a small wooden board bearing his name the letters of which were nearly obliterated I knelt down and kissed them and poured forth a prayer to God for guidance and support in the perilous step I was about to take As I passed the wreck of the old meeting house where before Nat Turner's time the slaves had been allowed to meet for worship I seemed to hear my father's voice come from it bidding me not to tarry till I reached freedom or the grave I rushed on with renovated hopes My trust in God had been strengthened by that prayer among the graves My plan was to conceal myself at the house of a friend and remain there a few weeks till the search was over My hope was that the doctor would get discouraged and for fear of losing my value and also of subsequently finding my children among the missing he would consent to sell us and I knew somebody would buy us I had done all in my power to make my children comfortable during the time I expected to be separated from them I was packing my things when grandmother came into the room and asked what I was doing I am putting my things in order I replied I tried to look and speak cheerfully but her watchful eye detected something beneath the surface She drew me towards her and asked me to sit down She looked earnestly at me and said Linda do you want to kill your old grandmother Do you mean to leave your little helpless children I am old now and cannot do for your babies as I once did for you I replied that if I went away perhaps their father would be able to secure their freedom Ah my child said she don't trust too much to him Stand by your own children and suffer with them till death Nobody respects a mother who forsakes her children and if you leave them you will never have a happy moment If you go you will make me miserable the short time I have to live You would be taken and brought back and your sufferings would be dreadful Remember poor Benjamin Do give it up Linda Try to bear a little longer Things may turn out better than we expect My courage failed me in view of the sorrow I should bring on that faithful loving old heart I promised that I would try longer and that I would take nothing out of her house without her knowledge Whenever the children climbed on my knee or laid their heads on my lap she would say Poor little souls what would you do without a mother She don't love you as I do And she would hug them to her own bosom as if to reproach me for my want of affection but she knew all the while that I loved them better than my life I slept with her that night and it was the last time The memory of it haunted me for many a year On Monday I returned to the plantation and busied myself with preparations for the important day Wednesday came It was a beautiful day and the faces of the slaves were as bright as the sunshine The poor creatures were merry They were expecting little presents from the bride and hoping for better times under her administration I had no such hopes for them I knew that the young wives of slaveholders often thought their authority and importance would be best established and maintained by cruelty and what I had heard of young Mrs Flint gave me no reason to expect that her rule over them would be less severe than that of the master and overseer Truly the colored race are the most cheerful and forgiving people on the face of the earth That their masters sleep in safety is owing to their superabundance of heart and yet they look upon their sufferings with less pity than they would bestow on those of a horse or a dog I stood at the door with others to receive the bridegroom and bride She was a handsome delicate-looking girl and her face flushed with emotion at sight of her new home I thought it likely that visions of a happy future were rising before her It made me sad for I knew how soon clouds would come over her sunshine She examined every part of the house and told me she was delighted with the arrangements I had made I was afraid old Mrs Flint had tried to prejudice her against me and I did my best to please her All passed off smoothly for me until dinner time arrived I did not mind the embarrassment of waiting on a dinner party for the first time in my life half so much as I did the meeting with Dr Flint and his wife who would be among the guests It was a mystery to me why Mrs Flint had not made her appearance at the plantation during all the time I was putting the house in order I had not met her face to face for five years and I had no wish to see her now She was a praying woman and doubtless considered my present position a special answer to her prayers Nothing could please her better than to see me humbled and trampled upon I was just where she would have mein the power of a hard unprincipled master She did not speak to me when she took her seat at the table but her satisfied triumphant smile when I handed her plate was more eloquent than words The old doctor was not so quiet in his demonstrations He ordered me here and there and spoke with peculiar emphasis when he said your mistress I was drilled like a disgraced soldier When all was over and the last key turned I sought my pillow thankful that God had appointed a season of rest for the weary The next day my new mistress began her housekeeping I was not exactly appointed maid of all work but I was to do whatever I was told Monday evening came It was always a busy time On that night the slaves received their weekly allowance of food Three pounds of meat a peck of corn and perhaps a dozen herring were allowed to each man Women received a pound and a half of meat a peck of corn and the same number of herring Children over twelve years old had half the allowance of the women The meat was cut and weighed by the foreman of the field hands and piled on planks before the meat house Then the second foreman went behind the building and when the first foreman called out Who takes this piece of meat he answered by calling somebody's name This method was resorted to as a means of preventing partiality in distributing the meat The young mistress came out to see how things were done on her plantation and she soon gave a specimen of her character Among those in waiting for their allowance was a very old slave who had faithfully served the Flint family through three generations When he hobbled up to get his bit of meat the mistress said he was too old to have any allowance that when niggers were too old to work they ought to be fed on grass Poor old man He suffered much before he found rest in the grave My mistress and I got along very well together At the end of a week old Mrs Flint made us another visit and was closeted a long time with her daughter-in-law I had my suspicions what was the subject of the conference The old doctor's wife had been informed that I could leave the plantation on one condition and she was very desirous to keep me there If she had trusted me as I deserved to be trusted by her she would have had no fears of my accepting that condition When she entered her carriage to return home she said to young Mrs Flint Don't neglect to send for them as quick as possible My heart was on the watch all the time and I at once concluded that she spoke of my children The doctor came the next day and as I entered the room to spread the tea table I heard him say Don't wait any longer Send for them to-morrow I saw through the plan They thought my children's being there would fetter me to the spot and that it was a good place to break us all in to abject submission to our lot as slaves After the doctor left a gentleman called who had always manifested friendly feelings towards my grandmother and her family Mr Flint carried him over the plantation to show him the results of labor performed by men and women who were unpaid miserably clothed and half famished The cotton crop was all they thought of It was duly admired and the gentleman returned with specimens to show his friends I was ordered to carry water to wash his hands As I did so he said Linda how do you like your new home I told him I liked it as well as I expected He replied They don't think you are contented and to-morrow they are going to bring your children to be with you I am sorry for you Linda I hope they will treat you kindly I hurried from the room unable to thank him My suspicions were correct My children were to be brought to the plantation to be broke in To this day I feel grateful to the gentleman who gave me this timely information It nerved me to immediate action XVII THE FLIGHT MR FLINT was hard pushed for house servants and rather than lose me he had restrained his malice I did my work faithfully though not of course with a willing mind They were evidently afraid I should leave them Mr Flint wished that I should sleep in the great house instead of the servants' quarters His wife agreed to the proposition but said I mustn't bring my bed into the house because it would scatter feathers on her carpet I knew when I went there that they would never think of such a thing as furnishing a bed of any kind for me and my little one I therefore carried my own bed and now I was forbidden to use it I did as I was ordered But now that I was certain my children were to be put in their power in order to give them a stronger hold on me I resolved to leave them that night I remembered the grief this step would bring upon my dear old grandmother and nothing less than the freedom of my children would have induced me to disregard her advice I went about my evening work with trembling steps Mr Flint twice called from his chamber door to inquire why the house was not locked up I replied that I had not done my work You have had time enough to do it said he Take care how you answer me I shut all the windows locked all the doors and went up to the third story to wait till midnight How long those hours seemed and how fervently I prayed that God would not forsake me in this hour of utmost need I was about to risk every thing on the throw of a die and if I failed O what would become of me and my poor children They would be made to suffer for my fault At half past twelve I stole softly down stairs I stopped on the second floor thinking I heard a noise I felt my way down into the parlor and looked out of the window The night was so intensely dark that I could see nothing I raised the window very softly and jumped out Large drops of rain were falling and the darkness bewildered me I dropped on my knees and breathed a short prayer to God for guidance and protection I groped my way to the road and rushed towards the town with almost lightning speed I arrived at my grandmother's house but dared not see her She would say Linda you are killing me and I knew that would unnerve me I tapped softly at the window of a room occupied by a woman who had lived in the house several years I knew she was a faithful friend and could be trusted with my secret I tapped several times before she heard me At last she raised the window and I whispered Sally I have run away Let me in quick She opened the door softly and said in low tones For God's sake don't Your grandmother is trying to buy you and de chillern Mr Sands was here last week He tole her he was going away on business but he wanted her to go ahead about buying you and de chillern and he would help her all he could Don't run away Linda Your grandmother is all bowed down wid trouble now I replied Sally they are going to carry my children to the plantation to-morrow and they will never sell them to any body so long as they have me in their power Now would you advise me to go back No chile no answered she When dey finds you is gone dey won't want de plague ob de chillern but where is you going to hide Dey knows ebery inch ob dis house I told her I had a hiding-place and that was all it was best for her to know I asked her to go into my room as soon as it was light and take all my clothes out of my trunk and pack them in hers for I knew Mr Flint and the constable would be there early to search my room I feared the sight of my children would be too much for my full heart but I could not go out into the uncertain future without one last look I bent over the bed where lay my little Benny and baby Ellen Poor little ones fatherless and motherless Memories of their father came over me He wanted to be kind to them but they were not all to him as they were to my womanly heart I knelt and prayed for the innocent little sleepers I kissed them lightly and turned away As I was about to open the street door Sally laid her hand on my shoulder and said Linda is you gwine all alone Let me call your uncle No Sally I replied I want no one to be brought into trouble on my account I went forth into the darkness and rain I ran on till I came to the house of the friend who was to conceal me Early the next morning Mr Flint was at my grandmother's inquiring for me She told him she had not seen me and supposed I was at the plantation He watched her face narrowly and said Don't you know any thing about her running off She assured him that she did not He went on to say Last night she ran off without the least provocation We had treated her very kindly My wife liked her She will soon be found and brought back Are her children with you When told that they were he said I am very glad to hear that If they are here she cannot be far off If I find out that any of my niggers have had any thing to do with this damned business I'll give 'em five hundred lashes As he started to go to his father's he turned round and added persuasively Let her be brought back and she shall have her children to live with her The tidings made the old doctor rave and storm at a furious rate It was a busy day for them My grandmother's house was searched from top to bottom As my trunk was empty they concluded I had taken my clothes with me Before ten o'clock every vessel northward bound was thoroughly examined and the law against harboring fugitives was read to all on board At night a watch was set over the town Knowing how distressed my grandmother would be I wanted to send her a message but it could not be done Every one who went in or out of her house was closely watched The doctor said he would take my children unless she became responsible for them which of course she willingly did The next day was spent in searching Before night the following advertisement was posted at every corner and in every public place for miles round REWARD Ran away from the subscriber an intelligent bright mulatto girl named Linda years age Five feet four inches high Dark eyes and black hair inclined to curl but it can be made straight Has a decayed spot on a front tooth She can read and write and in all probability will try to get to the Free States All persons are forbidden under penalty of the law to harbor or employ said slave will be given to whoever takes her in the state and if taken out of the state and delivered to me or lodged in jail DR FLINT XVIII MONTHS OF PERIL THE search for me was kept up with more perseverence than I had anticipated I began to think that escape was impossible I was in great anxiety lest I should implicate the friend who harbored me I knew the consequences would be frightful and much as I dreaded being caught even that seemed better than causing an innocent person to suffer for kindness to me A week had passed in terrible suspense when my pursuers came into such close vicinity that I concluded they had tracked me to my hiding-place I flew out of the house and concealed myself in a thicket of bushes There I remained in an agony of fear for two hours Suddenly a reptile of some kind seized my leg In my fright I struck a blow which loosened its hold but I could not tell whether I had killed it it was so dark I could not see what it was I only knew it was something cold and slimy The pain I felt soon indicated that the bite was poisonous I was compelled to leave my place of concealment and I groped my way back into the house The pain had become intense and my friend was startled by my look of anguish I asked her to prepare a poultice of warm ashes and vinegar and I applied it to my leg which was already much swollen The application gave me some relief but the swelling did not abate The dread of being disabled was greater than the physical pain I endured My friend asked an old woman who doctored among the slaves what was good for the bite of a snake or a lizard She told her to steep a dozen coppers in vinegar over night and apply the cankered vinegar to the inflamed part I had succeeded in cautiously conveying some messages to my relatives They were harshly threatened and despairing of my having a chance to escape they advised me to return to my master ask his forgiveness and let him make an example of me But such counsel had no influence on me When I started upon this hazardous undertaking I had resolved that come what would there should be no turning back Give me liberty or give me death was my motto When my friend contrived to make known to my relatives the painful situation I had been in for twenty-four hours they said no more about my going back to my master Something must be done and that speedily but where to turn for help they knew not God in his mercy raised up a friend in need Among the ladies who were acquainted with my grandmother was one who had known her from childhood and always been very friendly to her She had also known my mother and her children and felt interested for them At this crisis of affairs she called to see my grandmother as she not unfrequently did She observed the sad and troubled expression of her face and asked if she knew where Linda was and whether The poison of a snake is a powerful acid and is counteracted by powerful alkalies such as potash ammonia c The Indians are accustomed to apply wet ashes or plunge the limb into strong lie White men employed to lay out railroads in snaky places often carry ammonia with them as an antidoteEDITOR she was safe My grandmother shook her head without answering Come Aunt Martha said the kind lady tell me all about it Perhaps I can do something to help you The husband of this lady held many slaves and bought and sold slaves She also held a number in her own name but she treated them kindly and would never allow any of them to be sold She was unlike the majority of slaveholders' wives My grandmother looked earnestly at her Something in the expression of her face said Trust me and she did trust her She listened attentively to the details of my story and sat thinking for a while At last she said Aunt Martha I pity you both If you think there is any chance of Linda's getting to the Free States I will conceal her for a time But first you must solemnly promise that my name shall never be mentioned If such a thing should become known it would ruin me and my family No one in my house must know of it except the cook She is so faithful that I would trust my own life with her and I know she likes Linda It is a great risk but I trust no harm will come of it Get word to Linda to be ready as soon as it is dark before the patrols are out I will send the housemaids on errands and Betty shall go to meet Linda The place where we were to meet was designated and agreed upon My grandmother was unable to thank the lady for this noble deed overcome by her emotions she sank on her knees and sobbed like a child I received a message to leave my friend's house at such an hour and go to a certain place where a friend would be waiting for me As a matter of prudence no names were mentioned I had no means of conjecturing who I was to meet or where I was going I did not like to move thus blindfolded but I had no choice It would not do for me to remain where I was I disguised myself summoned up courage to meet the worst and went to the appointed place My friend Betty was there she was the last person I expected to see We hurried along in silence The pain in my leg was so intense that it seemed as if I should drop but fear gave me strength We reached the house and entered unobserved Her first words were Honey now you is safe Dem devils ain't coming to search dis house When I get you into missis' safe place I will bring some nice hot supper I specs you need it after all dis skeering Betty's vocation led her to think eating the most important thing in life She did not realize that my heart was too full for me to care much about supper The mistress came to meet us and led me up stairs to a small room over her own sleeping apartment You will be safe here Linda said she I keep this room to store away things that are out of use The girls are not accustomed to be sent to it and they will not suspect anything unless they hear some noise I always keep it locked and Betty shall take care of the key But you must be very careful for my sake as well as your own and you must never tell my secret for it would ruin me and my family I will keep the girls busy in the morning that Betty may have a chance to bring your breakfast but it will not do for her to come to you again till night I will come to see you sometimes Keep up your courage I hope this state of things will not last long Betty came with the nice hot supper and the mistress hastened down stairs to keep things straight till she returned How my heart overflowed with gratitude Words choked in my throat but I could have kissed the feet of my benefactress For that deed of Christian womanhood may God forever bless her I went to sleep that night with the feeling that I was for the present the most fortunate slave in town Morning came and filled my little cell with light I thanked the heavenly Father for this safe retreat Opposite my window was a pile of feather beds On the top of these I could lie perfectly concealed and command a view of the street through which Dr Flint passed to his office Anxious as I was I felt a gleam of satisfaction when I saw him Thus far I had outwitted him and I triumphed over it Who can blame slaves for being cunning They are constantly compelled to resort to it It is the only weapon of the weak and oppressed against the strength of their tyrants I was daily hoping to hear that my master had sold my children for I knew who was on the watch to buy them But Dr Flint cared even more for revenge than he did for money My brother William and the good aunt who had served in his family twenty years and my little Benny and Ellen who was a little over two years old were thrust into jail as a means of compelling my relatives to give some information about me He swore my grandmother should never see one of them again till I was brought back They kept these facts from me for several days When I heard that my little ones were in a loathsome jail my first impulse was to go to them I was encountering dangers for the sake of freeing them and must I be the cause of their death The thought was agonizing My benefactress tried to soothe me by telling me that my aunt would take good care of the children while they remained in jail But it added to my pain to think that the good old aunt who had always been so kind to her sister's orphan children should be shut up in prison for no other crime than loving them I suppose my friends feared a reckless movement on my part knowing as they did that my life was bound up in my children I received a note from my brother William It was scarcely legible and ran thus Wherever you are dear sister I beg of you not to come here We are all much better off than you are If you come you will ruin us all They would force you to tell where you had been or they would kill you Take the advice of your friends if not for the sake of me and your children at least for the sake of those you would ruin Poor William He also must suffer for being my brother I took his advice and kept quiet My aunt was taken out of jail at the end of a month because Mrs Flint could not spare her any longer She was tired of being her own housekeeper It was quite too fatiguing to order her dinner and eat it too My children remained in jail where brother William did all he could for their comfort Betty went to see them sometimes and brought me tidings She was not permitted to enter the jail but William would hold them up to the grated window while she chatted with them When she repeated their prattle and told me how they wanted to see their ma my tears would flow Old Betty would exclaim Lors chile what's you crying 'bout Dem young uns vil kill you dead Don't be so chick'n hearted If you does you vil nebber git thro' dis world Good old soul She had gone through the world childless She had never had little ones to clasp their arms round her neck she had never seen their soft eyes looking into hers no sweet little voices had called her mother she had never pressed her own infants to her heart with the feeling that even in fetters there was something to live for How could she realize my feelings Betty's husband loved children dearly and wondered why God had denied them to him He expressed great sorrow when he came to Betty with the tidings that Ellen had been taken out of jail and carried to Dr Flint's She had the measles a short time before they carried her to jail and the disease had left her eyes affected The doctor had taken her home to attend to them My children had always been afraid of the doctor and his wife They had never been inside of their house Poor little Ellen cried all day to be carried back to prison The instincts of childhood are true She knew she was loved in the jail Her screams and sobs annoyed Mrs Flint Before night she called one of the slaves and said Here Bill carry this brat back to the jail I can't stand her noise If she would be quiet I should like to keep the little minx She would make a handy waiting maid for my daughter by and by But if she staid here with her white face I suppose I should either kill her or spoil her I hope the doctor will sell them as far as wind and water can carry them As for their mother her ladyship will find out yet what she gets by running away She hasn't so much feeling for her children as a cow has for its calf If she had she would have come back long ago to get them out of jail and save all this expense and trouble The good-for-nothing hussy When she is caught she shall stay in jail in irons for one six months and then be sold to a sugar plantation I shall see her broke in yet What do you stand there for Bill Why don't you go off with the brat Mind now that you don't let any of the niggers speak to her in the street When these remarks were reported to me I smiled at Mrs Flint's saying that she should either kill my child or spoil her I thought to myself there was very little danger of the latter I have always considered it as one of God's special providences that Ellen screamed till was carried back to jail That same night Dr Flint was called to a patient and did not return till near morning Passing my grandmother's he saw a light in the house and thought to himself Perhaps this has something to do with Linda He knocked and the door was opened What calls you up so early said he I saw your light and I thought I would just stop and tell you that I have found out where Linda is I know where to put my hands on her and I shall have her before twelve o'clock When he had turned away my grandmother and my uncle looked anxiously at each other They did not know whether or not it was merely one of the doctor's tricks to frighten them In their uncertainty they thought it was best to have a message conveyed to my friend Betty Unwilling to alarm her mistress Betty resolved to dispose of me herself She came to me and told me to rise and dress quickly We hurried down stairs and across the yard into the kitchen She locked the door and lifted up a plank in the floor A buffalo skin and a bit of carpet were spread for me to lie on and a quilt thrown over me Stay dar said she till I sees if dey know 'bout you Dey say dey vil put thar hans on you afore twelve o'clock If dey did know whar you are dey won't know now Dey'll be disapinted dis time Dat's all I got to say If dey comes rummagin 'mong my tings dey'll get one bressed sarssin from dis 'ere nigger In my shallow bed I had but just room enough to bring my hands to my face to keep the dust out of my eyes for Betty walked over me twenty times in an hour passing from the dresser to the fireplace When she was alone I could hear her pronouncing anathemas over Dr Flint and all his tribe every now and then saying with a chuckling laugh Dis nigger's too cute for 'em dis time When the housemaids were about she had sly ways of drawing them out that I might hear what they would say She would repeat stories she had heard about my being in this or that or the other place To which they would answer that I was not fool enough to be staying round there that I was in Philadelphia or New York before this time When all were abed and asleep Betty raised the plank and said Come out chile come out Dey don't know nottin 'bout you 'Twas only white folks' lies to skeer de niggers Some days after this adventure I had a much worse fright As I sat very still in my retreat above stairs cheerful visions floated through my mind I thought Dr Flint would soon get discouraged and would be willing to sell my children when he lost all hopes of making them the means of my discovery I knew who was ready to buy them Suddenly I heard a voice that chilled my blood The sound was too familiar to me it had been too dreadful for me not to recognize at once my old master He was in the house and I at once concluded that he had come to seize me I looked round in terror There was no way of escape The voice receded I supposed the constable was with him and they were searching the house In my alarm I did not forget the trouble I was bringing on my generous benefactress It seemed as if I were born to bring sorrow on all who befriended me and that was the bitterest drop in the bitter cup of my life After a while I heard approaching footsteps the key was turned in my door I braced myself against the wall to keep from falling I ventured to look up and there stood my kind benefactress I was too much overcome to speak and sunk down upon the floor I thought you would hear your master's voice she said and knowing you would be terrified I came to tell you there is nothing to fear You may even indulge in a laugh at the old gentleman's expense He is so sure you are in New York that he came to borrow five hundred dollars to go in pursuit of you My sister had some money to loan on interest He has obtained it and proposes to start for New York to-night So for the present you see you are safe The doctor will merely lighten his pocket hunting after the bird he has left behind XIX THE CHILDREN SOLD THE doctor came back from New York of course without accomplishing his purpose He had expended considerable money and was rather disheartened My brother and the children had now been in jail two months and that also was some expense My friends thought it was a favorable time to work on his discouraged feelings Mr Sands sent a speculator to offer him nine hundred dollars for my brother William and eight hundred for the two children These were high prices as slaves were then selling but the offer was rejected If it had been merely a question of money the doctor would have sold any boy of Benny's age for two hundred dollars but he could not bear to give up the power of revenge But he was hard pressed for money and he revolved the matter in his mind He knew that if he could keep Ellen till she was fifteen he could sell her for a high price but I presume he reflected that she might die or might be stolen away At all events he came to the conclusion that he had better accept the slave-trader's offer Meeting him in the street he inquired when he would leave town To-day at ten o'clock he replied Ah do you go so soon said the doctor I have been reflecting upon your proposition and I have concluded to let you have the three negroes if you will say nineteen hundred dollars After some parley the trader agreed to his terms He wanted the bill of sale drawn up and signed immediately as he had a great deal to attend to during the short time he remained in town The doctor went to the jail and told William he would take him back into his service if he would promise to behave himself but he replied that he would rather be sold And you shall be sold you ungrateful rascal exclaimed the doctor In less than an hour the money was paid the papers were signed sealed and delivered and my brother and children were in the hands of the trader It was a hurried transaction and after it was over the doctor's characteristic caution returned He went back to the speculator and said Sir I have come to lay you under obligations of a thousands dollars not to sell any of those negroes in this state You come too late replied the trader our bargain is closed He had in fact already sold them to Mr Sands but he did not mention it The doctor required him to put irons on that rascal Bill and to pass through the back streets when he took his gang out of town The trader was privately instructed to concede to his wishes My good old aunt went to jail to bid the children good by supposing them to be the speculator's property and that she should never see them again As she held Benny in her lap he said Aunt Nancy I want to show you something He led her to the door and showed her a long row of marks saying Uncle Will taught me to count I have made a mark for every day I have been here and it is sixty days It is a long time and the speculator is going to take me and Ellen away He's a bad man It's wrong for him to take grandmother's children I want to go to my mother My grandmother was told that the children would be restored to her but she was requested to act as if they were really to be sent away Accordingly she made up a bundle of clothes and went to the jail When she arrived she found William handcuffed among the gang and the children in the trader's cart The scene seemed too much like a reality She was afraid there might have been some deception or mistake She fainted and was carried home When the wagon stopped at the hotel several gentlemen came out and proposed to purchase William but the trader refused their offers without stating that he was already sold And now came the trying hour for that drove of human beings driven away like cattle to be sold they knew not where Husbands were torn from wives parents from children never to look upon each other again this side the grave There was wringing of hands and cries of despair Dr Flint had the supreme satisfaction of seeing the wagon leave town and Mrs Flint had the gratification of supposing that my children were going as far as wind and water would carry them According to the agreement my uncle followed the wagon some miles until they came to an old farm house There the trader took the irons from William and as he did so he said You are a damned clever fellow I should like to own you myself Them gentlemen that wanted to buy you said you was a bright honest chap and I must git you a good home I guess your old master will swear to-morrow and call himself an old fool for selling the children I reckon he'll never git their mammy back agin I expect she's made tracks for the north Good by old boy Remember I have done you a good turn You must thank me by coaxing all the pretty gals to go with me next fall That's going to be my last trip The trading in niggers is a bad business for a fellow that's got any heart Move on you fellows And the gang went on God alone knows where Much as I despise and detest the class of slave-traders whom I regard as the vilest wretches on earth I must do this man the justice to say that he seemed to have some feeling He took a fancy to William in the jail and wanted to buy him When he heard the story of my children he was willing to aid them in getting out of Dr Flint's power even without charging the customary fee My uncle procured a wagon and carried William and the children back to town Great was the joy in my grandmother's house The curtains were closed and the candles lighted The happy grandmother cuddled the little ones to her bosom They hugged her and kissed her and clapped their hands and shouted She knelt down and poured forth one of her heartfelt prayers of thanksgiving to God The father was present for awhile and though such a parental relation as existed between him and my children takes slight hold of the heart or consciences of slaveholders it must be that he experienced some moments of pure joy in witnessing the happiness he had imparted I had no share in the rejoicings of that evening The events of that day had not come to my knowledge And now I will tell you something that happened to me though you will perhaps think it illustrates the superstition of slaves I sat in my usual place on the floor near the window where I could hear much that was said in the street without being seen The family had retired for the night and all was still I sat there thinking of my children when I heard a low strain of music A band of serenaders were under the window playing Home sweet home I listened till the sounds did not seem like music but like the moaning of children It seemed as if my heart would burst I rose from my sitting posture and knelt A streak of moonlight was on the floor before me and in the midst of it appeared the forms of my two children They vanished but I had seen them distinctly Some will call it a dream others a vision I know not how to account for it but it made a strong impression on my mind and I felt certain something had happened to my little ones I had not seen Betty since morning Now I heard her softly turning the key As soon as she entered I clung to her and begged her to let me know whether my children were dead or whether they were sold for I had seen their spirits in my room and I was sure something had happened to them Lor chile said she putting her arms round me you's got de highsterics I'll sleep wid you to-night 'cause you'll make a noise and ruin missis Something has stirred you up mightily When you is done cryin I'll talk wid you De chillern is well and mighty happy I seed 'em myself Does dat satisfy you Dar chile be still Somebody vill hear you I tried to obey her She lay down and was soon sound asleep but no sleep would come to my eyelids At dawn Betty was up and off to the kitchen The hours passed on and the vision of the night kept constantly recurring to my thought After a while I heard the voices of two women in the entry In one of them I recognized the housemaid The other said to her Did you know Linda Brent's children was sold to the speculator yesterday They say ole massa Flint was mighty glad to see 'em drove out of town but they say they've come back agin I 'spect it's all their daddy's doings They say he's bought William too Lor how it will take hold of ole massa Flint I'm going roun' to aunt Marthy's to see 'bout it I bit my lips till the blood came to keep from crying out Were my children with their grandmother or had the speculator carried them off The suspense was dreadful Would Betty never come and tell me the truth about it At last she came and I eagerly repeated what I had overheard Her face was one broad bright smile Lor you foolish ting said she I'se gwine to tell you all bout it De gals is eating thar breakfast and missus tole me to let her tell you but poor creeter t'aint right to keep you waitin' and I'se gwine to tell you Brudder chillern all is bought by de daddy I'se laugh more dan nuff tinking 'bout ole massa Flint Lor how he vill swar He's got ketched dis time and how but I must be getting out o' dis or dem gals vill come and ketch me Betty went off laughing and I said to myself Can it be true that my children are free I have not suffered for them in vain Thank God Great surprise was expressed when it was known that my children had returned to their grandmother's The news spread through town and many a kind word was bestowed on the little ones Dr Flint went to my grandmother's to ascertain who was the owner of my children and she informed him I expected as much said he I am glad to hear it I have had news from Linda lately and I shall soon have her You need never expect to see her free She shall be my slave as long as I live and when I am dead she shall be the slave of my children If I ever find out that you or Phillip had any thing to do with her running off I'll kill him And if I meet William in the street and he presumes to look at me I'll flog him within an inch of his life Keep those brats out of my sight As he turned to leave my grandmother said something to remind him of his own doings He looked back upon her as if he would have been glad to strike her to the ground I had my season of joy and thanksgiving It was the first time since my childhood that I had experienced any real happiness I heard of the old doctor's threats but they no longer had the same power to trouble me The darkest cloud that hung over my life had rolled away Whatever slavery might do to me it could not shackle my children If I fell a sacrifice my little ones were saved It was well for me that my simple heart believed all that had been promised for their welfare It is always better to trust than to doubt XX NEW PERILS THE doctor more exasperated than ever again tried to revenge himself on my relatives He arrested uncle Phillip on the charge of having aided my flight He was carried before a court and swore truly that he knew nothing of my intention to escape and that he had not seen me since I left my master's plantation The doctor then demanded that he should give bail for five hundred dollars that he would have nothing to do with me Several gentlemen offered to be security for him but Mr Sands told him he had better go back to jail and he would see that he came out without giving bail The news of his arrest was carried to my grandmother who conveyed it to Betty In the kindness of her heart she again stowed me away under the floor and as she walked back and forth in the performance of her culinary duties she talked apparently to herself but with the intention that I should hear what was going on I hoped that my uncle's imprisonment would last but few days still I was anxious I thought it likely that Dr Flint would do his utmost to taunt and insult him and I was afraid my uncle might lose control of himself and retort in some way that would be construed into a punishable offence and I was well aware that in court his word would not be taken against any white man's The search for me was renewed Something had excited suspicions that I was in the vicinity They searched the house I was in I heard their steps and their voices At night when all were asleep Betty came to release me from my place of confinement The fright I had undergone the constrained posture and the dampness of the ground made me ill for several days My uncle was soon after taken out of prison but the movements of all my relatives and of all our friends were very closely watched We all saw that I could not remain where I was much longer I had already staid longer than was intended and I knew my presence must be a source of perpetual anxiety to my kind benefactress During this time my friends had laid many plans for my escape but the extreme vigilance of my persecutors made it impossible to carry them into effect One morning I was much startled by hearing somebody trying to get into my room Several keys were tried but none fitted I instantly conjectured it was one of the housemaids and I concluded she must either have heard some noise in the room or have noticed the entrance of Betty When my friend came at her usual time I told her what had happened I knows who it was said she 'Pend upon it 'twas dat Jenny Dat nigger allers got de debble in her I suggested that she might have seen or heard something that excited her curiosity Tut tut chile exclaimed Betty she ain't seen notin' nor hearn notin' She only 'spects something Dat's all She wants to fine out who hab cut and make my gownd But she won't nebber know Dat's sartin I'll git missis to fix her I reflected a moment and said Betty I must leave here to-night Do as you tink best poor chile she replied I'se mighty 'fraid dat 'ere nigger vill pop on you some time She reported the incident to her mistress and received orders to keep Jenny busy in the kitchen till she could see my uncle Phillip He told her he would send a friend for me that very evening She told him she hoped I was going to the north for it was very dangerous for me to remain any where in the vicinity Alas it was not an easy thing for one in my situation to go to the north In order to leave the coast quite clear for me she went into the country to spend the day with her brother and took Jenny with her She was afraid to come and bid me good by but she left a kind message with Betty I heard her carriage roll from the door and I never again saw her who had so generously befriended the poor trembling fugitive Though she was a slaveholder to this day my heart blesses her I had not the slightest idea where I was going Betty brought me a suit of sailor's clothesjacket trousers and tarpaulin hat She gave me a small bundle saying I might need it where I was going In cheery tones she exclaimed I'se so glad you is gwine to free parts Don't forget ole Betty P'raps I'll come 'long by and by I tried to tell her how grateful I felt for all her kindness but she interrupted me I don't want no tanks honey I'se glad I could help you and I hope de good Lord vill open de path for you I'se gwine wid you to de lower gate Put your hands in your pockets and walk ricketty like de sailors I performed to her satisfaction At the gate I found Peter a young colored man waiting for me I had known him for years He had been an apprentice to my father and had always borne a good character I was not afraid to trust to him Betty bade me a hurried good by and we walked off Take courage Linda said my friend Peter I've got a dagger and no man shall take you from me unless he passes over my dead body It was a long time since I had taken a walk out of doors and the fresh air revived me It was also pleasant to hear a human voice speaking to me above a whisper I passed several people whom I knew but they did not recognize me in my disguise I prayed internally that for Peter's sake as well as my own nothing might occur to bring out his dagger We walked on till we came to the wharf My aunt Nancy's husband was a seafaring man and it had been deemed necessary to let him into our secret He took me into his boat rowed out to a vessel not far distant and hoisted me on board We three were the only occupants of the vessel I now ventured to ask what they proposed to do with me They said I was to remain on board till near dawn and then they would hide me in Snaky Swamp till my uncle Phillip had prepared a place of concealment for me If the vessel had been bound north it would have been of no avail to me for it would certainly have been searched About four o'clock we were again seated in the boat and rowed three miles to the swamp My fear of snakes had been increased by the venomous bite I had received and I dreaded to enter this hiding-place But I was in no situation to choose and I gratefully accepted the best that my poor persecuted friends could do for me Peter landed first and with a large knife cut a path through bamboos and briers of all descriptions He came back took me in his arms and carried me to a seat made among the bamboos Before we reached it we were covered with hundreds of mosquitos In an hour's time they had so poisoned my flesh that I was a pitiful sight to behold As the light increased I saw snake after snake crawling round us I had been accustomed to the sight of snakes all my life but these were larger than any I had ever seen To this day I shudder when I remember that morning As evening approached the number of snakes increased so much that we were continually obliged to thrash them with sticks to keep them from crawling over us The bamboos were so high and so thick that it was impossible to see beyond a very short distance Just before it became dark we procured a seat nearer to the entrance of the swamp being fearful of losing our way back to the boat It was not long before we heard the paddle of oars and the low whistle which had been agreed upon as a signal We made haste to enter the boat and were rowed back to the vessel I passed a wretched night for the heat of the swamp the mosquitos and the constant terror of snakes had brought on a burning fever I had just dropped asleep when they came and told me it was time to go back to that horrid swamp I could scarcely summon courage to rise But even those large venomous snakes were less dreadful to my imagination than the white men in that community called civilized This time Peter took a quantity of tobacco to burn to keep off the mosquitos It produced the desired effect on them but gave me nausea and severe headache At dark we returned to the vessel I had been so sick during the day that Peter declared I should go home that night if the devil himself was on patrol They told me a place of concealment had been provided for me at my grandmother's I could not imagine how it was possible to hide me in her house every nook and corner of which was known to the Flint family They told me to wait and see We were rowed ashore and went boldly through the streets to my grandmother's I wore my sailor's clothes and had blackened my face with charcoal I passed several people whom I knew The father of my children came so near that I brushed against his arm but he had no idea who it was You must make the most of this walk said my friend Peter for you may not have another very soon I thought his voice sounded sad It was kind of him to conceal from me what a dismal hole was to be my home for a long long time XXI THE LOOPHOLE OF RETREAT A SMALL shed had been added to my grandmother's house years ago Some boards were laid across the joists at the top and between these boards and the roof was a very small garret never occupied by any thing but rats and mice It was a pent roof covered with nothing but shingles according to the southern custom for such buildings The garret was only nine feet long and seven wide The highest part was three feet high and sloped down abruptly to the loose board floor There was no admission for either light or air My uncle Philip who was a carpenter had very skillfully made a concealed trap door which communicated with the storeroom He had been doing this while I was waiting in the swamp The storeroom opened upon a piazza To this hole I was conveyed as soon as I entered the house The air was stifling the darkness total A bed had been spread on the floor I could sleep quite comfortably on one side but the slope was so sudden that I could not turn on the other without hitting the roof The rats and mice ran over my bed but I was weary and I slept such sleep as the wretched may when a tempest has passed over them Morning came I knew it only by the noises I heard for in my small den day and night were all the same I suffered for air even more than for light But I was not comfortless I heard the voices of my children There was joy and there was sadness in the sound It made my tears flow How I longed to speak to them I was eager to look on their faces but there was no hole no crack through which I could peep This continued darkness was oppressive It seemed horrible to sit or lie in a cramped position day after day without one gleam of light Yet I would have chosen this rather than my lot as a slave though white people considered it an easy one and it was so compared with the fate of others I was never cruelly over-worked I was never lacerated with the whip from head to foot I was never so beaten and bruised that I could not turn from one side to the other I never had my heel-strings cut to prevent my running away I was never chained to a log and forced to drag it about while I toiled in the fields from morning till night I was never branded with hot iron or torn by bloodhounds On the contrary I had always been kindly treated and tenderly cared for until I came into the hands of Dr Flint I had never wished for freedom till then But though my life in slavery was comparatively devoid of hardships God pity the woman who is compelled to lead such a life My food was passed up to me through the trap-door my uncle had contrived and my grandmother my uncle Phillip and aunt Nancy would seize such opportunities as they could to mount up there and chat with me at the opening But of course this was not safe in the daytime It must all be done in darkness It was impossible for me to move in an erect position but I crawled about my den for exercise One day I hit my head against something and found it was a gimlet My uncle had left it sticking there when he made the trap-door I was as rejoiced as Robinson Crusoe could have been in finding such a treasure It put a lucky thought into my head I said to myself Now I will have some light Now I will see my children I did not dare to begin my work during the daytime for fear of attracting attention But I groped round and having found the side next the street where I could frequently see my children I stuck the gimlet in and waited for evening I bored three rows of holes one above another then I bored out the interstices between I thus succeeded in making one hole about an inch long and an inch broad I sat by it till late into the night to enjoy the little whiff of air that floated in In the morning I watched for my children The first person I saw in the street was Dr Flint I had a shuddering superstitious feeling that it was a bad omen Several familiar faces passed by At last I heard the merry laughing of children and presently two sweet little faces were looking up at me as though they knew I was there and were conscious of the joy they imparted How I longed to tell them I was there My condition was now a little improved But for weeks I was tormented by hundreds of little red insects fine as a needle's point that pierced through my skin and produced an intolerable burning The good grandmother gave me herb teas and cooling medicines and finally I got rid of them The heat of my den was intense for nothing but thin shingles protected me from the scorching summer's sun But I had my consolations Through my peeping-hole I could watch the children and when they were near enough I could hear their talk Aunt Nancy brought me all the news she could hear at Dr Flint's From her I learned that the doctor had written to New York to a colored woman who had been born and raised in our neighborhood and had breathed his contaminating atmosphere He offered her a reward if she could find out any thing about me I know not what was the nature of her reply but he soon after started for New York in haste saying to his family that he had business of importance to transact I peeped at him as he passed on his way to the steamboat It was a satisfaction to have miles of land and water between us even for a little while and it was a still greater satisfaction to know that he believed me to be in the Free States My little den seemed less dreary than it had done He returned as he did from his former journey to New York without obtaining any satisfactory information When he passed our house next morning Benny was standing at the gate He had heard them say that he had gone to find me and he called out Dr Flint did you bring my mother home I want to see her The doctor stamped his foot at him in a rage and exclaimed Get out of the way you little damned rascal If you don't I'll cut off your head Benny ran terrified into the house saying You can't put me in jail again I don't belong to you now It was well that the wind carried the words away from the doctor's ear I told my grandmother of it when we had our next conference at the trap-door and begged of her not to allow the children to be impertinent to the irascible old man Autumn came with a pleasant abatement of heat My eyes had become accustomed to the dim light and by holding my book or work in a certain position near the aperture I contrived to read and sew That was a great relief to the tedious monotony of my life But when winter came the cold penetrated through the thin shingle roof and I was dreadfully chilled The winters there are not so long or so severe as in northern latitudes but the houses are not built to shelter from cold and my little den was peculiarly comfortless The kind grandmother brought me bed-clothes and warm drinks Often I was obliged to lie in bed all day to keep comfortable but with all my precautions my shoulders and feet were frostbitten O those long gloomy days with no object for my eye to rest upon and no thoughts to occupy my mind except the dreary past and the uncertain future I was thankful when there came a day sufficiently mild for me to wrap myself up and sit at the loophole to watch the passers by Southerners have the habit of stopping and talking in the streets and I heard many conversations not intended to meet my ears I heard slave-hunters planning how to catch some poor fugitive Several times I heard allusions to Dr Flint myself and the history of my children who perhaps were playing near the gate One would say I wouldn't move my little finger to catch her as old Flint's property Another would say I'll catch any nigger for the reward A man ought to have what belongs to him if he is a damned brute The opinion was often expressed that I was in the Free States Very rarely did any one suggest that I might be in the vicinity Had the least suspicion rested on my grandmother's house it would have been burned to the ground But it was the last place they thought of Yet there was no place where slavery existed that could have afforded me so good a place of concealment Dr Flint and his family repeatedly tried to coax and bribe my children to tell something they had heard said about me One day the doctor took them into a shop and offered them some bright little silver pieces and gay handkerchiefs if they would tell where their mother was Ellen shrank away from him and would not speak but Benny spoke up and said Dr Flint I don't know where my mother is I guess she's in New York and when you go there again I wish you'd ask her to come home for I want to see her but if you put her in jail or tell her you'll cut her head off I'll tell her to go right back XXII CHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES CHRISTMAS was approaching Grandmother brought me materials and I busied myself making some new garments and little playthings for my children Were it not that hiring day is near at hand and many families are fearfully looking forward to the probability of separation in a few days Christmas might be a happy season for the poor slaves Even slave mothers try to gladden the hearts of their little ones on that occasion Benny and Ellen had their Christmas stockings filled Their imprisoned mother could not have the privilege of witnessing their surprise and joy But I had the pleasure of peeping at them as they went into the street with their new suits on I heard Benny ask a little playmate whether Santa Claus brought him any thing Yes replied the boy but Santa Claus ain't a real man It's the children's mothers that put things into the stockings No that can't be replied Benny for Santa Claus brought Ellen and me these new clothes and my mother has been gone this long time How I longed to tell him that his mother made those garments and that many a tear fell on them while she worked Every child rises early on Christmas morning to see the Johnkannaus Without them Christmas would be shorn of its greatest attraction They consist of companies of slaves from the plantations generally of the lower class Two athletic men in calico wrappers have a net thrown over them covered with all manner of bright-colored stripes Cows' tails are fastened to their backs and their heads are decorated with horns A box covered with sheepskin is called the gumbo box A dozen beat on this while others strike triangles and jawbones to which bands of dancers keep time For a month previous they are composing songs which are sung on this occasion These companies of a hundred each turn out early in the morning and are allowed to go round till twelve o'clock begging for contributions Not a door is left unvisited where there is the least chance of obtaining a penny or a glass of rum They do not drink while they are out but carry the rum home in jugs to have a carousal These Christmas donations frequently amount to twenty or thirty dollars It is seldom that any white man or child refuses to give them a trifle If he does they regale his ears with the following song Poor massa so dey say Down in de heel so dey say Got no money so dey say Not one shillin so dey say God A'mighty bress you so dey say Christmas is a day of feasting both with white and colored people Slaves who are lucky enough to have a few shillings are sure to spend them for good eating and many a turkey and pig is captured without saying By your leave sir Those who cannot obtain these cook a 'possum or a raccoon from which savory dishes can be made My grandmother raised poultry and pigs for sale and it was her established custom to have both a turkey and a pig roasted for Christmas dinner On this occasion I was warned to keep extremely quiet because two guests had been invited One was the town constable and the other was a free colored man who tried to pass himself off for white and who was always ready to do any mean work for the sake of currying favor with white people My grandmother had a motive for inviting them She managed to take them all over the house All the rooms on the lower floor were thrown open for them to pass in and out and after dinner they were invited up stairs to look at a fine mocking bird my uncle had just brought home There too the rooms were all thrown open that they might look in When I heard them talking on the piazza my heart almost stood still I knew this colored man had spent many nights hunting for me Every body knew he had the blood of a slave father in his veins but for the sake of passing himself off for white he was ready to kiss the slaveholders' feet How I despised him As for the constable he wore no false colors The duties of his office were despicable but he was superior to his companion inasmuch as he did not pretend to be what he was not Any white man who could raise money enough to buy a slave would have considered himself degraded by being a constable but the office enabled its possessor to exercise authority If he found any slave out after nine o'clock he could whip him as much as he liked and that was a privilege to be coveted When the guests were ready to depart my grandmother gave each of them some of her nice pudding as a present for their wives Through my peep-hole I saw them go out of the gate and I was glad when it closed after them So passed the first Christmas in my den XXIII STILL IN PRISON WHEN spring returned and I took in the little patch of green the aperture commanded I asked myself how many more summers and winters I must be condemned to spend thus I longed to draw in a plentiful draught of fresh air to stretch my cramped limbs to have room to stand erect to feel the earth under my feet again My relatives were constantly on the lookout for a chance of escape but none offered that seemed practicable and even tolerably safe The hot summer came again and made the turpentine drop from the thin roof over my head During the long nights I was restless for want of air and I had no room to toss and turn There was but one compensation the atmosphere was so stifled that even mosquitos would not condescend to buzz in it With all my detestation of Dr Flint I could hardly wish him a worse punishment either in this world or that which is to come than to suffer what I suffered in one single summer Yet the laws allowed him to be out in the free air while I guiltless of crime was pent up in here as the only means of avoiding the cruelties the laws allowed him to inflict upon me I don't know what kept life within me Again and again I thought I should die before long but I saw the leaves of another autumn whirl through the air and felt the touch of another winter In summer the most terrible thunder storms were acceptable for the rain came through the roof and I rolled up my bed that it might cool the hot boards under it Later in the season storms sometimes wet my clothes through and through and that was not comfortable when the air grew chilly Moderate storms I could keep out by filling the chinks with oakum But uncomfortable as my situation was I had glimpses of things out of doors which made me thankful for my wretched hiding-place One day I saw a slave pass our gate muttering It's his own and he can kill it if he will My grandmother told me that woman's history Her mistress had that day seen her baby for the first time and in the lineaments of its fair face she saw a likeness to her husband She turned the bondwoman and her child out of doors and forbade her ever to return The slave went to her master and told him what had happened He promised to talk with her mistress and make it all right The next day she and her baby were sold to a Georgia trader Another time I saw a woman rush wildly by pursued by two men She was a slave the wet nurse of her mistress's children For some trifling offence her mistress ordered her to be stripped and whipped To escape the degradation and the torture she rushed to the river jumped in and ended her wrongs in death Senator Brown of Mississippi could not be ignorant of many such facts as these for they are of frequent occurrence in every Southern State Yet he stood up in the Congress of the United States and declared that slavery was a great moral social and political blessing a blessing to the master and a blessing to the slave I suffered much more during the second winter than I did during the first My limbs were benumbed by inaction and the cold filled them with cramp I had a very painful sensation of coldness in my head even my face and tongue stiffened and I lost the power of speech Of course it was impossible under the circumstances to summon any physician My brother William came and did all he could for me Uncle Phillip also watched tenderly over me and poor grandmother crept up and down to inquire whether there were any signs of returning life I was restored to consciousness by the dashing of cold water in my face and found myself leaning against my brother's arm while he bent over me with streaming eyes He afterwards told me he thought I was dying for I had been in an unconscious state sixteen hours I next became delirious and was in great danger of betraying myself and my friends To prevent this they stupefied me with drugs I remained in bed six weeks weary in body and sick at heart How to get medical advice was the question William finally went to a Thompsonian doctor and described himself as having all my pains and aches He returned with herbs roots and ointment He was especially charged to rub on the ointment by a fire but how could a fire be made in my little den Charcoal in a furnace was tried but there was no outlet for the gas and it nearly cost me my life Afterwards coals already kindled were brought up in an iron pan and placed on bricks I was so weak and it was so long since I had enjoyed the warmth of a fire that those few coals actually made me weep I think the medicines did me some good but my recovery was very slow Dark thoughts passed through my mind as I lay there day after day I tried to be thankful for my little cell dismal as it was and even to love it as part of the price I had paid for the redemption of my children Sometimes I thought God was a compassionate Father who would forgive my sins for the sake of my sufferings At other times it seemed to me there was no justice or mercy in the divine government I asked why the curse of slavery was permitted to exist and why I had been so persecuted and wronged from youth upward These things took the shape of mystery which is to this day not so clear to my soul as I trust it will be hereafter In the midst of my illness grandmother broke down under the weight of anxiety and toil The idea of losing her who had always been my best friend and a mother to my children was the sorest trial I had yet had O how earnestly I prayed that she might recover How hard it seemed that I could not tend upon her who had so long and so tenderly watched over me One day the screams of a child nerved me with strength to crawl to my peeping-hole and I saw my son covered with blood A fierce dog usually kept chained had seized and bitten him A doctor was sent for and I heard the groans and screams of my child while the wounds were being sewed up O what torture to a mother's heart to listen to this and be unable to go to him But childhood is like a day in spring alternately shower and sunshine Before night Benny was bright and lively threatening the destruction of the dog and great was his delight when the doctor told him the next day that the dog had bitten another boy and been shot Benny recovered from his wounds but it was long before he could walk When my grandmother's illness became known many ladies who were her customers called to bring her some little comforts and to inquire whether she had every thing she wanted Aunt Nancy one night asked permission to watch with her sick mother and Mrs Flint replied I don't see any need of your going I can't spare you But when she found other ladies in the neighborhood were so attentive not wishing to be outdone in Christian charity she also sallied forth in magnificent condescension and stood by the bedside of her who had loved her in her infancy and who had been repaid by such grievous wrongs She seemed surprised to find her so ill and scolded uncle Phillip for not sending for Dr Flint She herself sent for him immediately and he came Secure as I was in my retreat I should have been terrified if I had known he was so near me He pronounced my grandmother in a very critical situation and said if her attending physician wished it he would visit her Nobody wished to have him coming to the house at all hours and we were not disposed to give him a chance to make out a long bill As Mrs Flint went out Sally told her the reason Benny was lame was that a dog had bitten him I'm glad of it she replied I wish he had killed him It would be good news to send to his mother Her day will come The dogs will grab her yet With these Christian words she and her husband departed and to my great satisfaction returned no more I heard from uncle Phillip with feelings of unspeakable joy and gratitude that the crisis was passed and grandmother would live I could now say from my heart God is merciful He has spared me the anguish of feeling that I caused her death XXIV THE CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS THE summer had nearly ended when Dr Flint made a third visit to New York in search of me Two candidates were running for Congress and he returned in season to vote The father of my children was the Whig candidate The doctor had hitherto been a stanch Whig but now he exerted all his energies for the defeat of Mr Sands He invited large parties of men to dine in the shade of his trees and supplied them with plenty of rum and brandy If any poor fellow drowned his wits in the bowl and in the openness of his convivial heart proclaimed that he did not mean to vote the Democratic ticket he was shoved into the street without ceremony The doctor expended his liquor in vain Mr Sands was elected an event which occasioned me some anxious thoughts He had not emancipated my children and if he should die they would be at the mercy of his heirs Two little voices that frequently met my ear pleaded with me not to let their father depart without striving to make their freedom secure Years had passed since I had spoken to him I had not even seen him since the night I passed him unrecognized in my disguise of a sailor I supposed he would call before he left to say something to my grandmother concerning the children and I resolved what course to take The day before his departure for Washington I made arrangements towards evening to get from my hiding-place into the storeroom below I found myself so stiff and clumsy that it was with great difficulty I could hitch from one resting place to another When I reached the storeroom my ankles gave way under me and I sank exhausted on the floor It seemed as if I could never use my limbs again But the purpose I had in view roused all the strength I had I crawled on my hands and knees to the window and screened behind a barrel I waited for his coming The clock struck nine and I knew the steamboat would leave between ten and eleven My hopes were failing But presently I heard his voice saying to some one Wait for me a moment I wish to see aunt Martha When he came out as he passed the window I said Stop one moment and let me speak for my children He started hesitated and then passed on and went out of the gate I closed the shutter I had partially opened and sank down behind the barrel I had suffered much but seldom had I experienced a leaner pang than I then felt Had my children then become of so little consequence to him And had he so little feeling for their wretched mother that he would not listen a moment while she pleaded for them Painful memories were so busy within me that I forgot I had not hooked the shutter till I heard some one opening it I looked up He had come back Who called me said he in a low tone I did I replied Oh Linda said he I knew your voice but I was afraid to answer lest my friend should hear me Why do you come here Is it possible you risk yourself in this house They are mad to allow it I shall expect to hear that you are all ruined I did not wish to implicate him by letting him know my place of concealment so I merely said I thought you would come to bid grandmother good by and so I came here to speak a few words to you about emancipating my children Many changes may take place during the six months you are gone to Washington and it does not seem right for you to expose them to the risk of such changes I want nothing for myself all I ask is that you will free my children or authorize some friend to do it before you go He promised he would do it and also expressed a readiness to make any arrangements whereby I could be purchased I heard footsteps approaching and closed the shutter hastily I wanted to crawl back to my den without letting the family know what I had done for I knew they would deem it very imprudent But he stepped back into the house to tell my grandmother that he had spoken with me at the storeroom window and to beg of her not to allow me to remain in the house over night He said it was the height of madness for me to be there that we should certainly all be ruined Luckily he was in too much of a hurry to wait for a reply or the dear old woman would surely have told him all I tried to go back to my den but found it more difficult to go up than I had to come down Now that my mission was fulfilled the little strength that had supported me through it was gone and I sank helpless on the floor My grandmother alarmed at the risk I had run came into the storeroom in the dark and locked the door behind her Linda she whispered where are you I am here by the window I replied I couldn't have him go away without emancipating the children Who knows what may happen Come come child said she it won't do for you to stay here another minute You've done wrong but I can't blame you poor thing I told her I could not return without assistance and she must call my uncle Uncle Phillip came and pity prevented him from scolding me He carried me back to my dungeon laid me tenderly on the bed gave me some medicine and asked me if there was any thing more he could do Then he went away and I was left with my own thoughtsstarless as the midnight darkness around me My friends feared I should become a cripple for life and I was so weary of my long imprisonment that had it not been for the hope of serving my children I should have been thankful to die but for their sakes I was willing to bear on XXV COMPETITION IN CUNNING DR FLINT had not given me up Every now and then he would say to my grandmother that I would yet come back and voluntarily surrender myself and that when I did I could be purchased by my relatives or any one who wished to buy me I knew his cunning nature too well not to believe that this was a trap laid for me and so all my friends understood it I resolved to match my cunning against his cunning In order to make him believe that I was in New York I resolved to write him a letter dated from that place I sent for my friend Peter and asked him if he knew any trustworthy seafaring person who would carry such a letter to New York and put it in the post office there He said he knew one that he would trust with his own life to the ends of the world I reminded him that it was a hazardous thing for him to undertake He said he knew it but he was willing to do any thing to help me I expressed a wish for a New York paper to ascertain the names of some of the streets He run his hand into his pocket and said Here is half a one that was round a cap I bought of a pedler yesterday I told him the letter would be ready the next evening He bade me good by adding Keep up your spirits Linda brighter days will come by and by My uncle Phillip kept watch over the gate until our brief interview was over Early the next morning I seated myself near the little aperture to examine the newspaper It was a piece of the New York Herald and for once the paper that systematically abuses the colored people was made to render them a service Having obtained what information I wanted concerning streets and numbers I wrote two letters one to my grandmother the other to Dr Flint I reminded him how he a gray-headed man had treated a helpless child who had been placed in his power and what years of misery he had brought upon her To my grandmother I expressed a wish to have my children sent to me at the north where I could teach them to respect themselves and set them a virtuous example which a slave mother was not allowed to do at the south I asked her to direct her answer to a certain street in Boston as I did not live in New York though I went there sometimes I dated these letters ahead to allow for the time it would take to carry them and sent a memorandum of the date to the messenger When my friend came for the letters I said God bless and reward you Peter for this disinterested kindness Pray be careful If you are detected both you and I will have to suffer dreadfully I have not a relative who would dare to do it for me He replied You may trust to me Linda I don't forget that your father was my best friend and I will be a friend to his children so long as God lets me live It was necessary to tell my grandmother what I had done in order that she might be ready for the letter and prepared to hear what Dr Flint might say about my being at the north She was sadly troubled She felt sure mischief would come of it I also told my plan to aunt Nancy in order that she might report to us what was said at Dr Flint's house I whispered it to her through a crack and she whispered back I hope it will succeed I shan't mind being a slave all my life if I can only see you and the children free I had directed that my letters should be put into the New York post office on the th of the month On that evening of the th my aunt came to say that Dr Flint and his wife had been talking in a low voice about a letter he had received and that when he went to his office he promised to bring it when he came to tea So I concluded I should hear my letter read the next morning I told my grandmother Dr Flint would be sure to come and asked her to have him sit near a certain door and leave it open that I might hear what he said The next morning I took my station within sound of that door and remained motionless as a statue It was not long before I heard the gate slam and the well-known footsteps enter the house He seated himself in the chair that was placed for him and said Well Martha I've brought you a letter from Linda She has sent me a letter also I know exactly where to find her but I don't choose to go to Boston for her I had rather she would come back of her own accord in a respectable manner Her uncle Phillip is the best person to go for her With him she would feel perfectly free to act I am willing to pay his expenses going and returning She shall be sold to her friends Her children are free at least I suppose they are and when you obtain her freedom you'll make a happy family I suppose Martha you have no objection to my reading to you the letter Linda has written to you He broke the seal and I heard him read it The old villian He had suppressed the letter I wrote to grandmother and prepared a substitute of his own the purport of which was as follows Dear Grandmother I have long wanted to write to you but the disgraceful manner in which I left you and my children made me ashamed to do it If you knew how much I have suffered since I ran away you would pity and forgive me I have purchased freedom at a dear rate If any arrangement could be made for me to return to the south without being a slave I would gladly come If not I beg of you to send my children to the north I cannot live any longer without them Let me know in time and I will meet them in New York or Philadelphia whichever place best suits my uncle's convenience Write as soon as possible to your unhappy daughter LINDA It is very much as I expected it would be said the old hypocrite rising to go You see the foolish girl has repented of her rashness and wants to return We must help her to do it Martha Talk with Phillip about it If he will go for her she will trust to him and come back I should like an answer tomorrow Good morning Martha As he stepped out on the piazza he stumbled over my little girl Ah Ellen is that you he said in his most gracious manner I didn't see you How do you do Pretty well sir she replied I heard you tell grandmother that my mother is coming home I want to see her Yes Ellen I am going to bring her home very soon rejoiced he and you shall see her as much as you like you little curly-headed nigger This was as good as a comedy to me who had heard it all but grandmother was frightened and distressed because the doctor wanted my uncle to go for me The next evening Dr Flint called to talk the matter over My uncle told him that from what he had heard of Massachusetts he judged he should be mobbed if he went there after a runaway slave All stuff and nonsense Phillip replied the doctor Do you suppose I want you to kick up a row in Boston The business can all be done quietly Linda writes that she wants to come back You are her relative and she would trust you The case would be different if I went She might object to coming with me and the damned abolitionists if they knew I was her master would not believe me if I told them she had begged to go back They would get up a row and I should not like to see Linda dragged through the streets like a common negro She has been very ungrateful to me for all my kindness but I forgive her and want to act the part of a friend towards her I have no wish to hold her as my slave Her friends can buy her as soon as she arrives here Finding that his arguments failed to convince my uncle the doctor let the cat out of the bag by saying that he had written to the mayor of Boston to ascertain whether there was a person of my description at the street and number from which my letter was dated He had omitted this date in the letter he had made up to read to my grandmother If I had dated from New York the old man would probably have made another journey to that city But even in that dark region where knowledge is so carefully excluded from the slave I had heard enough about Massachusetts to come to the conclusion that slaveholders did not consider it a comfortable place to go to in search of a runaway That was before the Fugitive Slave Law was passed before Massachusetts had consented to become a nigger hunter for the south My grandmother who had become skittish by seeing her family always in danger came to me with a very distressed countenance and said What will you do if the mayor of Boston sends him word that you haven't been there Then he will suspect the letter was a trick and maybe he'll find out something about it and we shall all get into trouble O Linda I wish you had never sent the letters Don't worry yourself grandmother said I The mayor of Boston won't trouble himself to hunt niggers for Dr Flint The letters will do good in the end I shall get out of this dark hole some time or other I hope you will child replied the good patient old friend You have been here a long time almost five years but whenever you do go it will break your old grandmother's heart I should be expecting every day to hear that you were brought back in irons and put in jail God help you poor child Let us be thankful that some time or other we shall go where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest My heart responded Amen The fact that Dr Flint had written to the mayor of Boston convinced me that he believed my letter to be genuine and of course that he had no suspicion of my being any where in the vicinity It was a great object to keep up this delusion for it made me and my friends feel less anxious and it would be very convenient whenever there was a chance to escape I resolved therefore to continue to write letters from the north from time to time Two or three weeks passed and as no news came from the mayor of Boston grandmother began to listen to my entreaty to be allowed to leave my cell sometimes and exercise my limbs to prevent my becoming a cripple I was allowed to slip down into the small storeroom early in the morning and remain there a little while The room was all filled up with barrels except a small open space under my trap-door This faced the door the upper part of which was of glass and purposely left uncurtained that the curious might look in The air of this place was close but it was so much better than the atmosphere of my cell that I dreaded to return I came down as soon as it was light and remained till eight o'clock when people began to be about and there was danger that some one might come on the piazza I had tried various applications to bring warmth and feeling into my limbs but without avail They were so numb and stiff that it was a painful effort to move and had my enemies come upon me during the first mornings I tried to exercise them a little in the small unoccupied space of the storeroom it would have been impossible for me to have escaped XXVI IMPORTANT ERA IN MY BROTHER'S LIFE I MISSED the company and kind attentions of my brother William who had gone to Washington with his master Mr Sands We received several letters from him written without any allusion to me but expressed in such a manner that I knew he did not forget me I disguised my hand and wrote to him in the same manner It was a long session and when it closed William wrote to inform us that Mr Sands was going to the north to be gone some time and that he was to accompany him I knew that his master had promised to give him his freedom but no time had been specified Would William trust to a slave's chances I remembered how we used to talk together in our young days about obtaining our freedom and I thought it very doubtful whether he would come back to us Grandmother received a letter from Mr Sands saying that William had proved a most faithful servant and he would also say a valued friend that no mother had ever trained a better boy He said he had travelled through the Northern States and Canada and though the abolitionists had tried to decoy him away they had never succeeded He ended by saying they should be at home shortly We expected letters from William describing the novelties of his journey but none came In time it was reported that Mr Sands would return late in the autumn accompanied by a bride Still no letters from William I felt almost sure I should never see him again on southern soil but had he no word of comfort to send to his friends at home to the poor captive in her dungeon My thoughts wandered through the dark past and over the uncertain future Alone in my cell where no eye but God's could see me I wept bitter tears How earnestly I prayed to him to restore me to my children and enable me to be a useful woman and a good mother At last the day arrived for the return of the travellers Grandmother had made loving preparations to welcome her absent boy back to the old hearthstone When the dinner table was laid William's plate occupied its old place The stage coach went by empty My grandmother waited dinner She thought perhaps he was necessarily detained by his master In my prison I listened anxiously expecting every moment to hear my dear brother's voice and step In the course of the afternoon a lad was sent by Mr Sands to tell grandmother that William did not return with him that the abolitionists had decoyed him away But he begged her not to feel troubled about it for he felt confident she would see William in a few days As soon as he had time to reflect he would come back for he could never expect to be so well off at the north as he had been with him If you had seen the tears and heard the sobs you would have thought the messenger had brought tidings of death instead of freedom Poor old grandmother felt that she should never see her darling boy again And I was selfish I thought more of what I had lost than of what my brother had gained A new anxiety began to trouble me Mr Sands had expended a good deal of money and would naturally feel irritated by the loss he had incurred I greatly feared this might injure the prospects of my children who were now becoming valuable property I longed to have their emancipation made certain The more so because their master and father was now married I was too familiar with slavery not to know that promises made to slaves though with kind intentions and sincere at the time depend upon many contingencies for their fulfillment Much as I wished William to be free the step he had taken made me sad and anxious The following Sabbath was calm and clear so beautiful that it seemed like a Sabbath in the eternal world My grandmother brought the children out on the piazza that I might hear their voices She thought it would comfort me in my despondency and it did They chatted merrily as only children can Benny said Grandmother do you think uncle Will has gone for good Won't he ever come back again May be he'll find mother If he does won't she be glad to see him Why don't you and uncle Phillip and all of us go and live where mother is I should like it wouldn't you Ellen Yes I should like it replied Ellen but how could we find her Do you know the place grandmother I don't remember how mother lookeddo you Benny Benny was just beginning to describe me when they were interrupted by an old slave woman a near neighbor named Aggie This poor creature had witnessed the sale of her children and seen them carried off to parts unknown without any hopes of ever hearing from them again She saw that my grandmother had been weeping and she said in a sympathizing tone What's the matter aunt Marthy O Aggie she replied it seems as if I shouldn't have any of my children or grandchildren left to hand me a drink when I'm dying and lay my old body in the ground My boy didn't come back with Mr Sands He staid at the north Poor old Aggie clapped her hands for joy Is dat what you's crying fur she exclaimed Git down on your knees and bress de Lord I don't know whar my poor chillern is and I nebber 'spect to know You don't know whar poor Linda's gone to but you do know whar her brudder is He's in free parts and dat's de right place Don't murmur at de Lord's doings but git down on your knees and tank him for his goodness My selfishness was rebuked by what poor Aggie said She rejoiced over the escape of one who was merely her fellow-bondman while his own sister was only thinking what his good fortune might cost her children I knelt and prayed God to forgive me and I thanked him from my heart that one of my family was saved from the grasp of slavery It was not long before we received a letter from William He wrote that Mr Sands had always treated him kindly and that he had tried to do his duty to him faithfully But ever since he was a boy he had longed to be free and he had already gone through enough to convince him he had better not lose the chance that offered He concluded by saying Don't worry about me dear grandmother I shall think of you always and it will spur me on to work hard and try to do right When I have earned money enough to give you a home perhaps you will come to the north and we can all live happy together Mr Sands told my uncle Phillip the particulars about William's leaving him He said I trusted him as if he were my own brother and treated him as kindly The abolitionists talked to him in several places but I had no idea they could tempt him However I don't blame William He's young and inconsiderate and those Northern rascals decoyed him I must confess the scamp was very bold about it I met him coming down the steps of the Astor House with his trunk on his shoulder and I asked him where he was going He said he was going to change his old trunk I told him it was rather shabby and asked if he didn't need some money He said No thanked me and went off He did not return so soon as I expected but I waited patiently At last I went to see if our trunks were packed ready for our journey I found them locked and a sealed note on the table informed me where I could find the keys The fellow even tried to be religious He wrote that he hoped God would always bless me and reward me for my kindness that he was not unwilling to serve me but he wanted to be a free man and that if I thought he did wrong he hoped I would forgive him I intended to give him his freedom in five years He might have trusted me He has shown himself ungrateful but I shall not go for him or send for him I feel confident that he will soon return to me I afterwards heard an account of the affair from William himself He had not been urged away by abolitionists He needed no information they could give him about slavery to stimulate his desire for freedom He looked at his hands and remembered that they were once in irons What security had he that they would not be so again Mr Sands was kind to him but he might indefinitely postpone the promise he had made to give him his freedom He might come under pecuniary embarrassments and his property be seized by creditors or he might die without making any arrangements in his favor He had too often known such accidents to happen to slaves who had kind masters and he wisely resolved to make sure of the present opportunity to own himself He was scrupulous about taking any money from his master on false pretences so he sold his best clothes to pay for his passage to Boston The slaveholders pronounced him a base ungrateful wretch for thus requiting his master's indulgence What would they have done under similar circumstances When Dr Flint's family heard that William had deserted Mr Sands they chuckled greatly over the news Mrs Flint made her usual manifestations of Christian feeling by saying I'm glad of it I hope he'll never get him again I like to see people paid back in their own coin I reckon Linda's children will have to pay for it I should be glad to see them in the speculator's hands again for I'm tired of seeing those little niggers march about the streets XXVII NEW DESTINATION FOR THE CHILDREN MRS FLINT proclaimed her intention of informing Mrs Sands who was the father of my children She likewise proposed to tell her what an artful devil I was that I had made a great deal of trouble in her family that when Mr Sands was at the north she didn't doubt I had followed him in disguise and persuaded William to run away She had some reason to entertain such an idea for I had written from the north from time to time and I dated my letters from various places Many of them fell into Dr Flint's hands as I expected they would and he must have come to the conclusion that I travelled about a good deal He kept a close watch over my children thinking they would eventually lead to my detection A new and unexpected trial was in store for me One day when Mr Sands and his wife were walking in the street they met Benny The lady took a fancy to him and exclaimed What a pretty little negro Whom does he belong to Benny did not hear the answer but he came home very indignant with the stranger lady because she had called him a negro A few days afterwards Mr Sands called on my grandmother and told her he wanted her to take the children to his house He said he had informed his wife of his relation to them and told her they were motherless and she wanted to see them When he had gone my grandmother came and asked what I would do The question seemed a mockery What could I do They were Mr Sands's slaves and their mother was a slave whom he had represented to be dead Perhaps he thought I was I was too much pained and puzzled to come to any decision and the children were carried without my knowledge Mrs Sands had a sister from Illinois staying with her This lady who had no children of her own was so much pleased with Ellen that she offered to adopt her and bring her up as she would a daughter Mrs Sands wanted to take Benjamin When grandmother reported this to me I was tried almost beyond endurance Was this all I was to gain by what I had suffered for the sake of having my children free True the prospect seemed fair but I knew too well how lightly slaveholders held such parental relations If pecuniary troubles should come or if the new wife required more money than could conveniently be spared my children might be thought of as a convenient means of raising funds I had no trust in thee O Slavery Never should I know peace till my children were emancipated with all due formalities of law I was too proud to ask Mr Sands to do any thing for my own benefit but I could bring myself to become a supplicant for my children I resolved to remind him of the promise he had made me and to throw myself upon his honor for the performance of it I persuaded my grandmother to go to him and tell him I was not dead and that I earnestly entreated him to keep the promise he had made me that I had heard of the recent proposals concerning my children and did not feel easy to accept them that he had promised to emancipate them and it was time for him to redeem his pledge I know there was some risk in thus betraying that I was in the vicinity but what will not a mother do for her children He received the message with surprise and said The children are free I have never intended to claim them as slaves Linda may decide their fate In my opinion they had better be sent to the north I don't think they are quite safe here Dr Flint boasts that they are still in his power He says they were his daughter's property and as she was not of age when they were sold the contract is not legally binding So then after all I had endured for their sakes my poor children were between two fires between my old master and their new master And I was powerless There was no protecting arm of the law for me to invoke Mr Sands proposed that Ellen should go for the present to some of his relatives who had removed to Brooklyn Long Island It was promised that she should be well taken care of and sent to school I consented to it as the best arrangement I could make for her My grandmother of course negotiated it all and Mrs Sands knew of no other person in the transaction She proposed that they should take Ellen with them to Washington and keep her till they had a good chance of sending her with friends to Brooklyn She had an infant daughter I had a glimpse of it as the nurse passed with it in her arms It was not a pleasant thought to me that the bondwoman's child should tend her free-born sister but there was no alternative Ellen was made ready for the journey O how it tried my heart to send her away so young alone among strangers Without a mother's love to shelter her from the storms of life almost without memory of a mother I doubted whether she and Benny would have for me the natural affection that children feel for a parent I thought to myself that I might perhaps never see my daughter again and I had a great desire that she should look upon me before she went that she might take my image with her in her memory It seemed to me cruel to have her brought to my dungeon It was sorrow enough for her young heart to know that her mother was a victim of slavery without seeing the wretched hiding place to which it had driven her I begged permission to pass the last night in one of the open chambers with my little girl They thought I was crazy to think of trusting such a young child with my perilous secret I told them I had watched her character and I felt sure she would not betray me that I was determined to have an interview and if they would not facilitate it I would take my own way to obtain it They remonstrated against the rashness of such a proceeding but finding they could not change my purpose they yielded I slipped through the trap-door into the storeroom and my uncle kept watch at the gate while I passed into the piazza and went up stairs to the room I used to occupy It was more than five years since I had seen it and how the memories crowded on me There I had taken shelter when my mistress drove me from her house there came my old tyrant to mock insult and curse me there my children were first laid in my arms there I had watched over them each day with a deeper and sadder love there I had knelt to God in anguish of heart to forgive the wrong I had done How vividly it all came back And after this long gloomy interval I stood there such a wreck In the midst of these meditations I heard footsteps on the stairs The door opened and my uncle Phillip came in leading Ellen by the hand I put my arms round her and said Ellen my dear child I am your mother She drew back a little and looked at me then with sweet confidence she laid her cheek against mine and I folded her to the heart that had been so long desolated She was the first to speak Raising her head she said inquiringly You really are my mother I told her I really was that during all the long time she had not seen me I had loved her most tenderly and that now she was going away I wanted to see her and talk with her that she might remember me With a sob in her voice she said I'm glad you've come to see me but why didn't you ever come before Benny and I have wanted so much to see you He remembers you and sometimes he tells me about you Why didn't you come home when Dr Flint went to bring you I answered I couldn't come before dear But now that I am with you tell me whether you like to go away I don't know said she crying Grandmother says I ought not to cry that I am going to a good place where I can learn to read and write and that by and by I can write her a letter But I shan't have Benny or grandmother or uncle Phillip or any body to love me Can't you go with me O do go dear mother I told her I couldn't go now but sometime I would come to her and then she and Benny and I would live together and have happy times She wanted to run and bring Benny to see me now I told her he was going to the north before long with uncle Phillip and then I would come to see him before he went away I asked if she would like to have me stay all night and sleep with her O yes she replied Then turning to her uncle she said pleadingly May I stay Please uncle She is my own mother He laid his hand on her head and said solemnly Ellen this is the secret you have promised grandmother never to tell If you ever speak of it to any body they will never let you see your grandmother again and your mother can never come to Brooklyn Uncle she replied I will never tell He told her she might stay with me and when he had gone I took her in my arms and told her I was a slave and that was the reason she must never say she had seen me I exhorted her to be a good child to try to please the people where she was going and that God would raise her up friends I told her to say her prayers and remember always to pray for her poor mother and that God would permit us to meet again She wept and I did not check her tears Perhaps she would never again have a chance to pour her tears into a mother's bosom All night she nestled in my arms and I had no inclination to slumber The moments were too precious to lose any of them Once when I thought she was asleep I kissed her forehead softly and she said I am not asleep dear mother Before dawn they came to take me back to my den I drew aside the window curtain to take a last look of my child The moonlight shone on her face and I bent over her as I had done years before that wretched night when I ran away I hugged her close to my throbbing heart and tears too sad for such young eyes to shed flowed down her cheeks as she gave her last kiss and whispered in my ear Mother I will never tell And she never did When I got back to my den I threw myself on the bed and wept there alone in the darkness It seemed as if my heart would burst When the time for Ellen's departure drew nigh I could hear neighbors and friends saying to her Good by Ellen I hope your poor mother will find you out Won't you be glad to see her She replied Yes ma'am and they little dreamed of the weighty secret that weighed down her young heart She was an affectionate child but naturally very reserved except with those she loved and I felt secure that my secret would be safe with her I heard the gate close after her with such feelings as only a slave mother can experience During the day my meditations were very sad Sometimes I feared I had been very selfish not to give up all claim to her and let her go to Illinois to be adopted by Mrs Sands's sister It was my experience of slavery that decided me against it I feared that circumstances might arise that would cause her to be sent back I felt confident that I should go to New York myself and then I should be able to watch over her and in some degree protect her Dr Flint's family knew nothing of the proposed arrangement till after Ellen was gone and the news displeased them greatly Mrs Flint called on Mrs Sands's sister to inquire into the matter She expressed her opinion very freely as to the respect Mr Sands's showed for his wife and for his own character in acknowledging those young niggers And as for sending Ellen away she pronounced it to be just as much stealing as it would be for him to come and take a piece of furniture out of her parlor She said her daughter was not of age to sign the bill of sale and the children were her property and when she became of age or was married she could take them wherever she could lay hands on them Miss Emily Flint the little girl to whom I had been bequeathed was now in her sixteenth year Her mother considered it all right and honorable for her or her future husband to steal my children but she did not understand how any body could hold up their heads in respectable society after they had purchased their own children as Mr Sands had done Dr Flint said very little Perhaps he thought that Benny would be less likely to be sent away if he kept quiet One of my letters that fell into his hands was dated from Canada and he seldom spoke of me now This state of things enabled me to slip down into the storeroom more frequently where I could stand upright and move my limbs more freely Days weeks and months passed and there came no news of Ellen I sent a letter to Brooklyn written in my grandmother's name to inquire whether she had arrived there Answer was returned that she had not I wrote to her in Washington but no notice was taken of it There was one person there who ought to have had some sympathy with the anxiety of the child's friends at home but the links of such relations as he had formed with me are easily broken and cast away as rubbish Yet how protectively and persuasively he once talked to the poor helpless slave girl And how entirely I trusted him But now suspicions darkened my mind Was my child dead or had they deceived me and sold her If the secret memoirs of many members of Congress should be published curious details would be unfolded I once saw a letter from a member of Congress to a slave who was the mother of six of his children He wrote to request that she would send her children away from the great house before his return as he expected to be accompanied by friends The woman could not read and was obliged to employ another to read the letter The existence of the colored children did not trouble this gentleman it was only the fear that friends might recognize in their features a resemblance to him At the end of six months a letter came to my grandmother from Brooklyn It was written by a young lady in the family and announced that Ellen had just arrived It contained the following message from her I do try to do just as you told me to and I pray for you every night and morning I understood that these words were meant for me and they were a balsam to my heart The writer closed her letter by saying Ellen is a nice girl and we shall like to have to have her with us My cousin Mr Sands has given her to me to be my little waiting maid I shall send her to school and I hope some day she will write to you herself This letter perplexed and troubled me Had my child's father merely placed her there till she was old enough to support herself Or had he given her to his cousin as a piece of property If the last idea was correct his cousin might return to the south at any time and hold Ellen as a slave I tried to put away from me the painful thought that such a foul wrong could have been done to us I said to myself Surely there must be some justice in man then I remembered with a sigh how slavery perverted all the natural feelings of the human heart It gave me a pang to look on my light-hearted boy He believed himself free and to have him brought under the yoke of slavery would be more than I could bear How I longed to have him safely out of the reach of its power XXVIII AUNT NANCY I HAVE mentioned my great-aunt who was a slave in Dr Flint's family and who had been my refuge during the shameful persecutions I suffered from him This aunt had been married at twenty years of age that is as far as slaves can marry She had the consent of her master and mistress and a clergyman performed the ceremony But it was a mere form without any legal value Her master or mistress could annul it any day they pleased She had always slept on the floor in the entry near Mrs Flint's chamber door that she might be within call When she was married she was told that she might have the use of a small room in an outhouse Her mother and her husband furnished it He was a seafaring man and was allowed to sleep there when he was at home But on the wedding evening the bride was ordered to her old post on the entry floor Mrs Flint at that time had no children but she was expecting to be a mother and if she should want a drink of water in the night what could she do without her slave to bring it So my aunt was compelled to lie at her door until one midnight she was forced to leave to give premature birth to a child In a fortnight she was required to resume her place on the entry floor because Mrs Flint's babe needed her attentions She kept her station there through the summer and winter until she had given premature birth to six children and all the while she was employed as night-nurse to Mr Flint's children Finally toiling all day and being deprived of rest at night completely broke down her constitution and Dr Flint declared it was impossible she could ever become the mother of a living child The fear of losing so valuable a servant by death now induced them to allow her to sleep in her little room in the out-house except when there was sickness in the family She afterwards had two feeble babes one of whom died in a few days and the other in four weeks I well remember her patient sorrow as she held the last dead baby in her arms I wish it could have lived she said it is not the will of God that any of my children should live But I will try to be fit to meet their little spirits in heaven Aunt Nancy was housekeeper and waiting-maid in Dr Flint's family Indeed she was the factotum of the household Nothing went on well without her She was my mother's twin sister and as far as was in her power she supplied a mother's place to us orphans I slept with her all the time I lived in my old master's house and the bond between us was very strong When my friends tried to discourage me from running away she always encouraged me When they thought I had better return and ask my master's pardon because there was no possibility of escape she sent me word never to yield She said if I persevered I might perhaps gain the freedom of my children and even if I perished in doing it that was better than to leave them to groan under the same persecutions that had blighted my own life After I was shut up in my dark cell she stole away whenever she could to bring me the news and say something cheering How often did I kneel down to listen to her words of consolation whispered through a crack I am old and have not long to live she used to say and I could die happy if I could only see you and the children free You must pray to God Linda as I do for you that he will lead you out of this darkness I would beg her not to worry herself on my account that there was an end of all the suffering sooner or later and that whether I lived in chains or in freedom I should always remember her as the good friend who had been the comfort of my life A word from her always strengthened me and not me only The whole family relied upon her judgment and were guided by her advice I had been in my cell six years when my grandmother was summoned to the bedside of this her last remaining daughter She was very ill and they said she would die Grandmother had not entered Dr Flint's house for several years They had treated her cruelly but she thought nothing of that now She was grateful for permission to watch by the death-bed of her child They had always been devoted to each other and now they sat looking into each other's eyes longing to speak of the secret that had weighed so much on them both My aunt had been stricken with paralysis She lived two days and the last day she was speechless Before she lost the power of utterance she told her mother not to grieve if she could not speak to her that she would try to hold up her hand to let her know that all was well with her Even the hard-heartened doctor was a little softened when he saw the dying woman try to smile on the aged mother who was kneeling by her side His eyes moistened for a moment as he said she had always been a faithful servant and they should never be able to supply her place Mrs Flint took to her bed quite overcome by the shock While my grandmother sat alone with the dead the doctor came in leading his youngest son who had always been a great pet with aunt Nancy and was much attached to her Martha said he aunt Nancy loved this child and when he comes where you are I hope you will be kind to him for her sake She replied Your wife was my foster-child Dr Flint the foster-sister of my poor Nancy and you little know me if you think I can feel any thing but good will for her children I wish the past could be forgotten and that we might never think of it said he and that Linda would come to supply her aunt's place She would be worth more to us than all the money that could be paid for her I wish it for your sake also Martha Now that Nancy is taken away from you she would be a great comfort to your old age He knew he was touching a tender chord Almost choking with grief my grandmother replied It was not I that drove Linda away My grandchildren are gone and of my nine children only one is left God help me To me the death of this kind relative was an inexpressible sorrow I knew that she had been slowly murdered and I felt that my troubles had helped to finish the work After I heard of her illness I listened constantly to hear what news was brought from the great house and the thought that I could not go to her made me utterly miserable At last as uncle Phillip came into the house I heard some one inquire How is she and he answered She is dead My little cell seemed whirling round and I knew nothing more till I opened my eyes and found uncle Phillip bending over me I had no need to ask any questions He whispered Linda she died happy I could not weep My fixed gaze troubled him Don't look so he said Don't add to my poor mother's trouble Remember how much she has to bear and that we ought to do all we can to comfort her Ah yes that blessed old grandmother who for seventy-three years had borne the pelting storms of a slave-mother's life She did indeed need consolation Mrs Flint had rendered her poor foster-sister childless apparently without any compunction and with cruel selfishness had ruined her health by years of incessant unrequited toil and broken rest But now she became very sentimental I suppose she thought it would be a beautiful illustration of the attachment existing between slaveholder and slave if the body of her old worn-out servant was buried at her feet She sent for the clergyman and asked if he had any objection to burying aunt Nancy in the doctor's family burial place No colored person had ever been allowed interment in the white people's burying-ground and the minister knew that all the deceased of our family reposed together in the old graveyard of the slaves He therefore replied I have no objection to complying with your wish but perhaps aunt Nancy's mother may have some choice as to where her remains shall be deposited It had never occurred to Mrs Flint that slaves could have any feelings When my grandmother was consulted she at once said she wanted Nancy to lie with all the rest of her family and where her own old body would be buried Mrs Flint graciously complied with her wish though she said it was painful to her to have Nancy buried away from her She might have added with touching pathos I was so long used to sleep with her lying near me on the entry floor My uncle Phillip asked permission to bury his sister at his own expense and slaveholders are always ready to grant such favors to slaves and their relatives The arrangements were very plain but perfectly respectable She was buried on the Sabbath and Mrs Flint's minister read the funeral service There was a large concourse of colored people bond and free and a few white persons who had always been friendly to our family Dr Flint's carriage was in the procession and when the body was deposited in its humble resting place the mistress dropped a tear and returned to her carriage probably thinking she had performed her duty nobly It was talked of by the slaves as a mighty grand funeral Northern travellers passing through the place might have described this tribute of respect to the humble dead as a beautiful feature in the patriarchal institution a touching proof of the attachment between slaveholders and their servants and tender-hearted Mrs Flint would have confirmed this impression with handkerchief at her eyes We could have told them a different story We could have given them a of wrongs and sufferings that would have touched their hearts if they had any hearts to feel for the colored people We could have told them how the poor old slave-mother had toiled year after year to earn eight hundred dollars to buy her son Phillip's right to his own earnings and how that same Phillip paid the expenses of the funeral which they regarded as doing so much credit to the master We could also have told them of a poor blighted young creature shut up in a living grave for years to avoid the tortures that would be inflicted on her if she ventured to come out and look on the face of her departed friend All this and much more I thought of as I sat at my loophole waiting for the family to return from the grave sometimes weeping sometimes falling asleep dreaming strange dreams of the dead and the living It was sad to witness the grief of my bereaved grandmother She had always been strong to bear and now as ever religious faith supported her But her dark life had become still darker and age and trouble were leaving deep traces on her withered face She had four places to knock for me to come to the trap-door and each place had a different meaning She now came oftener than she had done and talked to me of her dead daughter while tears trickled slowly down her furrowed cheeks I said all I could to comfort her but it was a sad reflection that instead of being able to help her I was a constant source of anxiety and trouble The poor old back was fitted to its burden It bent under it but did not break XXIX PREPARATIONS FOR ESCAPE I HARDLY expect that the reader will credit me when I affirm that I lived in that little dismal hole almost deprived of light and air and with no space to move my limbs for nearly seven years But it is a fact and to me a sad one even now for my body still suffers from the effects of that long imprisonment to say nothing of my soul Members of my family now living in New York and Boston can testify to the truth of what I say Countless were the nights that I sat late at the little loophole scarcely large enough to give me a glimpse of one twinkling star There I heard the patrols and slave-hunters conferring together about the capture of runaways well knowing how rejoiced they would be to catch me Season after season year after year I peeped at my children's faces and heard their sweet voices with a heart yearning all the while to say Your mother is here Sometimes it appeared to me as if ages had rolled away since I entered upon that gloomy monotonous existence At times I was stupefied and listless at other times I became very impatient to know when these dark years would end and I should again be allowed to feel the sunshine and breathe the pure air After Ellen left us this feeling increased Mr Sands had agreed that Benny might go to the north whenever his uncle Phillip could go with him and I was anxious to be there also to watch over my children and protect them so far as I was able Moreover I was likely to be drowned out of my den if I remained much longer for the slight roof was getting badly out of repair and uncle Phillip was afraid to remove the shingles lest some one should get a glimpse of me When storms occurred in the night they spread mats and bits of carpet which in the morning appeared have been laid out to dry but to cover the roof in the daytime might have attracted attention Consequently my clothes and bedding were often drenched a process by which the pains and aches in my cramped and stiffened limbs were greatly increased I revolved various plans of escape in my mind which I sometimes imparted to my grandmother when she came to whisper with me at the trap-door The kind-hearted old woman had an intense sympathy for runaways She had known too much of the cruelties inflicted on those who were captured Her memory always flew back at once to the sufferings of her bright and handsome son Benjamin the youngest and dearest of her flock So whenever I alluded to the subject she would groan out O don't think of it child You'll break my heart I had no good old aunt Nancy now to encourage me but my brother William and my children were continually beckoning me to the north And now I must go back a few months in my story I have stated that the first of January was the time for selling slaves or leasing them out to new masters If time were counted by heart-throbs the poor slaves might reckon years of suffering during that festival so joyous to the free On the New Year's day preceding my aunt's death one of my friends named Fanny was to be sold at auction to pay her master's debts My thoughts were with her during all the day and at night I anxiously inquired what had been her fate I was told that she had been sold to one master and her four little girls to another master far distant that she had escaped from her purchaser and was not to be found Her mother was the old Aggie I have spoken of She lived in a small tenement belonging to my grandmother and built on the same lot with her own house Her dwelling was searched and watched and that brought the patrols so near me that I was obliged to keep very close in my den The hunters were somehow eluded and not long afterwards Benny accidentally caught sight of Fanny in her mother's hut He told his grandmother who charged him never to speak of it explaining to him the frightful consequences and he never betrayed the trust Aggie little dreamed that my grandmother knew where her daughter was concealed and that the stooping form of her old neighbor was bending under a similar burden of anxiety and fear but these dangerous secrets deepened the sympathy between the two old persecuted mothers My friend Fanny and I remained many weeks hidden within call of each other but she was unconscious of the fact I longed to have her share my den which seemed a more secure retreat than her own but I had brought so much trouble on my grandmother that it seemed wrong to ask her to incur greater risks My restlessness increased I had lived too long in bodily pain and anguish of spirit Always I was in dread that by some accident or some contrivance slavery would succeed in snatching my children from me This thought drove me nearly frantic and I determined to steer for the North Star at all hazards At this crisis Providence opened an unexpected way for me to escape My friend Peter came one evening and asked to speak with me Your day has come Linda said he I have found a chance for you to go to the Free States You have a fortnight to decide The news seemed too good to be true but Peter explained his arrangements and told me all that was necessary was for me to say I would go I was going to answer him with a joyful yes when the thought of Benny came to my mind I told him the temptation was exceedingly strong but I was terribly afraid of Dr Flint's alleged power over my child and that I could not go and leave him behind Peter remonstrated earnestly He said such a good chance might never occur again that Benny was free and could be sent to me and that for the sake of my children's welfare I ought not to hesitate a moment I told him I would consult with uncle Phillip My uncle rejoiced in the plan and bade me to go by all means He promised if his life was spared that he would either bring or send my son to me as soon as I reached a place of safety I resolved to go but thought nothing had better be said to my grandmother till very near the time of departure But my uncle thought she would feel it more keenly if I left her so suddenly I will reason with her said he and convince her how necessary it is not only for your sake but for hers also You cannot be blind to the fact that she is sinking under her burdens I was not blind to it I knew that my concealment was an ever-present source of anxiety and that the older she grew the more nervously fearful she was of discovery My uncle talked with her and finally succeeded in persuading her that it was absolutely necessary for me to seize the chance so unexpectedly offered The anticipation of being a free woman proved almost too much for my weak frame The excitement stimulated me and at the same time bewildered me I made busy preparations for my journey and for my son to follow me I resolved to have an interview with him before I went that I might give him cautions and advice and tell him how anxiously I should be waiting for him at the north Grandmother stole up to me as often as possible to whisper words of counsel She insisted upon my writing to Dr Flint as soon as I arrived in the Free States and asking him to sell me to her She said she would sacrifice her house and all she had in the world for the sake of having me safe with my children in any part of the world If she could only live to know that she could die in peace I promised the dear old faithful friend that I would write to her as soon as I arrived and put the letter in a safe way to reach her but in my own mind I resolved that not another cent of her hard earnings should be spent to pay rapacious slaveholders for what they called their property And even if I had not been unwilling to buy what I had already a right to possess common humanity would have prevented me from accepting the generous offer at the expense of turning my aged relative out of house and home when she was trembling on the brink of the grave I was to escape in a vessel but I forbear to mention any further particulars I was in readiness but the vessel was unexpectedly detained several days Meantime news came to town of a most horrible murder committed on a fugitive slave named James Charity the mother of this unfortunate young man had been an old acquaintance of ours I have told the shocking particulars of his death in my description of some of the neighboring slaveholders My grandmother always nervously sensitive about runaways was terribly frightened She felt sure that a similar fate awaited me if I did not desist from my enterprise She sobbed and groaned and entreated me not to go Her excessive fear was somewhat contagious and my heart was not proof against her extreme agony I was grievously disappointed but I promised to relinquish my project When my friend Peter was apprised of this he was disappointed and vexed He said that judging from our past experience it would be a long time before I has such another chance to throw away I told him it need not be thrown away that I had a friend concealed near by who would be glad enough to take to the place that had been provided for me I told him about poor Fanny and the kind-hearted noble fellow who never turned his back upon any body in distress white or black expressed his readiness to help her Aggie was much surprised when she found that we knew her secret She was rejoiced to hear of such a chance for Fanny and arrangements were made for her to go on board the vessel the next night They both supposed that I had long been at the north therefore my name was not mentioned in the transaction Fanny was carried on board at the appointed time and stowed away in a very small cabin This accommodation had been purchased at a price that would pay for a voyage to England But when one proposes to go to fine old England they stop to calculate whether they can afford the cost of the pleasure while in making a bargain to escape from slavery the trembling victim is ready to say Take all I have only don't betray me The next morning I peeped through my loophole and saw that it was dark and cloudy At night I received news that the wind was ahead and the vessel had not sailed I was exceedingly anxious about Fanny and Peter too who was running a tremendous risk at my instigation Next day the wind and weather remained the same Poor Fanny had been half dead with fright when they carried her on board and I could readily imagine how she must be suffering now Grandmother came often to my den to say how thankful she was I did not go On the third morning she rapped for me to come down to the storeroom The poor old sufferer was breaking down under her weight of trouble She was easily flurried now I found her in a nervous excited state but I was not aware that she had forgotten to lock the door behind her as usual She was exceedingly worried about the detention of the vessel She was afraid all would be discovered and then Fanny and Peter and I would all be tortured to death and Phillip should be utterly ruined and her house would be torn down Poor Peter If he should die such a horrible death as the poor slave James had lately done and all for his kindness in trying to help me how dreadful it would be for us all Alas the thought was familiar to me and had sent many a sharp pang through my heart I tried to suppress my own anxiety and speak soothingly to her She brought in some allusion to aunt Nancy the dear daughter she had recently buried and then she lost all control of herself As she stood there trembling and sobbing a voice from the piazza called out Whar is you aunt Marthy Grandmother was startled and in her agitation opened the door without thinking of me In stepped Jenny the mischievous housemaid who had tried to enter my room when I was concealed in the house of my white benefactress I's bin huntin ebery whar for you aunt Marthy said she My missis wants you to send her some crackers I had slunk down behind a barrel which entirely screened me but I imagined that Jenny was looking directly at the spot and my heart beat violently My grandmother immediately thought what she had done and went out quickly with Jenny to count the crackers locking the door behind her She returned to me in a few minutes the perfect picture of despair Poor child she exclaimed my carelessness has ruined you The boat ain't gone yet Get ready immediately and go with Fanny I ain't got another word to say against it now for there's no telling what may happen this day Uncle Phillip was sent for and he agreed with his mother in thinking that Jenny would inform Dr Flint in less than twenty-four hours He advised getting me on board the boat if possible if not I had better keep very still in my den where they could not find me without tearing the house down He said it would not do for him to move in the matter because suspicion would be immediately excited but he promised to communicate with Peter I felt reluctant to apply to him again having implicated him too much already but there seemed to be no alternative Vexed as Peter had been by my indecision he was true to his generous nature and said at once that he would do his best to help me trusting I should show myself a stronger woman this time He immediately proceeded to the wharf and found that the wind had shifted and the vessel was slowly beating down stream On some pretext of urgent necessity he offered two boatmen a dollar apiece to catch up with her He was of lighter complexion than the boatmen he hired and when the captain saw them coming so rapidly he thought officers were pursuing his vessel in search of the runaway slave he had on board They hoisted sails but the boat gained upon them and the indefatigable Peter sprang on board The captain at once recognized him Peter asked him to go below to speak about a bad bill he had given him When he told his errand the captain replied Why the woman's here already and I've put her where you or the devil would have a tough job to find her But it is another woman I want to bring said Peter She is in great distress too and you shall be paid any thing within reason if you'll stop and take her What's her name inquired the captain Linda he replied That's the the name of the woman already here rejoined the captain By George I believe you mean to betray me O exclaimed Peter God knows I wouldn't harm a hair of your head I am too grateful to you But there really is another woman in great danger Do have the humanity to stop and take her After a while they came to an understanding Fanny not dreaming I was any where about in that region had assumed my name though she called herself Johnson Linda is a common name said Peter and the woman I want to bring is Linda Brent The captain agreed to wait at a certain place till evening being handsomely paid for his detention Of course the day was an anxious one for us all But we concluded that if Jenny had seen me she would be too wise to let her mistress know of it and that she probably would not get a chance to see Dr Flint's family till evening for I knew very well what were the rules in that household I afterwards believed that she did not see me for nothing ever came of it and she was one of those base characters that would have jumped to betray a suffering fellow being for the sake of thirty pieces of silver I made all my arrangements to go on board as soon as it was dusk The intervening time I resolved to spend with my son I had not spoken to him for seven years though I had been under the same roof and seen him every day when I was well enough to sit at the loophole I did not dare to venture beyond the storeroom so they brought him there and locked us up together in a place concealed from the piazza door It was an agitating interview for both of us After we had talked and wept together for a little while he said Mother I'm glad you're going away I wish I could go with you I knew you was here and I have been so afraid they would come and catch you I was greatly surprised and asked him how he had found it out He replied I was standing under the eaves one day before Ellen went away and I heard somebody cough up over the wood shed I don't know what made me think it was you but I did think so I missed Ellen the night before she went away and grandmother brought her back into the room in the night and I thought maybe she'd been to see you before she went for I heard grandmother whisper to her 'Now go to sleep and remember never to tell' I asked him if he ever mentioned his suspicions to his sister He said he never did but after he heard the cough if he saw her playing with other children on that side of the house he always tried to coax her round to the other side for fear they would hear me cough too He said he had kept a close lookout for Dr Flint and if he saw him speak to a constable or a patrol he always told grandmother I now recollected that I had seen him manifest uneasiness when people were on that side of the house and I had at the time been puzzled to conjecture a motive for his actions Such prudence may seem extraordinary in a boy of twelve years but slaves being surrounded by mysteries deceptions and dangers early learn to be suspicious and watchful and prematurely cautious and cunning He had never asked a question of grandmother or uncle Phillip and I had often heard him chime in with other children when they spoke of my being at the north I told him I was now really going to the Free States and if he was a good honest boy and a loving child to his dear old grandmother the Lord would bless him and bring him to me and we and Ellen would live together He began to tell me that grandmother had not eaten any thing all day While he was speaking the door was unlocked and she came in with a small bag of money which she wanted me to take I begged her to keep a part of it at least to pay for Benny's being sent to the north but she insisted while her tears were falling fast that I should take the whole You may be sick among strangers she said and they would send you to the poorhouse to die Ah that good grandmother For the last time I went up to my nook Its desolate appearance no longer chilled me for the light of hope had risen in my soul Yet even with the blessed prospect of freedom before me I felt very sad at leaving forever that old homestead where I had been sheltered so long by the dear old grandmother where I had dreamed my first young dream of love and where after that had faded away my children came to twine themselves so closely round my desolate heart As the hour approached for me to leave I again descended to the storeroom My grandmother and Benny were there She took me by the hand and said Linda let us pray We knelt down together with my child pressed to my heart and my other arm round the faithful loving old friend I was about to leave forever On no other occasion has it ever been my lot to listen to so fervent a supplication for mercy and protection It thrilled through my heart and inspired me with trust in God Peter was waiting for me in the street I was soon by his side faint in body but strong of purpose I did not look back upon the old place though I felt that I should never see it again XXX NORTHWARD BOUND I NEVER could tell how we reached the wharf My brain was all of a whirl and my limbs tottered under me At an appointed place we met my uncle Phillip who had started before us on a different route that he might reach the wharf first and give us timely warning if there was any danger A row-boat was in readiness As I was about to step in I felt something pull me gently and turning round I saw Benny looking pale and anxious He whispered in my ear I've been peeping into the doctor's window and he's at home Don't cry I'll come He hastened away I clasped the hand of my good uncle to whom I owed so much and of Peter the brave generous friend who had volunteered to run such terrible risks to secure my safety To this day I remember how bright his face beamed with joy when he told me he had discovered a safe method for me to escape Yet that intelligent enterprising noble-hearted man was a chattel liable by the laws of a country that calls itself civilized to be sold with horses and pigs We parted in silence Our hearts were all too full for words Swiftly the boat glided over the water After a while one of the sailors said Don't be down-hearted madam We will take you safely to your husband in At first I could not imagine what he meant but I had presence of mind to think that it probably referred to something the captain had told him so I thanked him and said I hoped we should have pleasant weather When I entered the vessel the captain came forward to meet me He was an elderly man with a pleasant countenance He showed me to a little box of a cabin where sat my friend Fanny She started as if she had seen a spectre She gazed on me in utter astonishment and exclaimed Linda can this be you or is it your ghost When we were locked in each other's arms my overwrought feelings could no longer be restrained My sobs reached the ears of the captain who came and very kindly reminded us that for his safety as well as our own it would be prudent for us not to attract any attention He said that when there was a sail in sight he wished us to keep below but at other times he had no objection to our being on deck He assured us that he would keep a good lookout and if we acted prudently he thought we should be in no danger He had represented us as women going to meet our husbands in We thanked him and promised to observe carefully all the directions he gave us Fanny and I now talked by ourselves low and quietly in our little cabin She told me of the sufferings she had gone through in making her escape and of her terrors while she was concealed in her mother's house Above all she dwelt on the agony of separation from all her children on that dreadful auction day She could scarcely credit me when I told her of the place where I had passed nearly seven years We have the same sorrows said I No replied she you are going to see your children soon and there is no hope that I shall ever even hear from mine The vessel was soon under way but we made slow progress The wind was against us I should not have cared for this if we had been out of sight of the town but until there were miles of water between us and our enemies we were filled with constant apprehension that the constables would come on board Neither could I feel quite at ease with the captain and his men I was an entire stranger to that class of people and I had heard that sailors were rough and sometimes cruel We were so completely in their power that if they were bad men our situation would be dreadful Now that the captain was paid for our passage might he not be tempted to make more money by giving us up to those who claimed us as property I was naturally of a confiding disposition but slavery had made me suspicious of every body Fanny did not share my distrust of the captain or his men She said she was afraid at first but she had been on board three days while the vessel lay in the dock and nobody had betrayed her or treated her otherwise than kindly The captain soon came to advise us to go on deck for fresh air His friendly and respectful manner combined with Fanny's testimony reassured me and we went with him He placed us in a comfortable seat and occasionally entered into conversations He told us he was a Southerner by birth and had spent the greater part of his life in the Slave States and that he had recently lost a brother who traded in slaves But said he it is a pitiable and degrading business and I always felt ashamed to acknowledge my brother in connection with it As we passed Snaky Swamp he pointed to it and said There is a slave territory that defies all the laws I though of the terrible days I had spent there and though it was not called Dismal Swamp it made me feel very dismal as I looked at it I shall never forget that night The balmy air of spring was so refreshing And how shall I describe my sensations when we were fairly sailing on Chesapeake Bay O the beautiful sunshine the exhilarating breeze and I could enjoy them without fear or restraint I had never realized what grand things air and sunlight are till I had been deprived of them Ten days after we left land we were approaching Philadelphia The captain said we should arrive there in the night but he thought we had better wait till morning and go on shore in broad daylight as the best way to avoid suspicion I replied You know best But will you stay on board and protect us He saw that I was suspicious and he said he was sorry now that he had brought us to the end of our voyage to find I had so little confidence in him Ah if he had ever been a slave he would have known how difficult it was to trust a white man He assured us that we might sleep through the night without fear that he would take care we were not left unprotected Be it said to the honor of this captain Southerner as he was that if Fanny and I had been white ladies and our passage lawfully engaged he could not have treated us more respectfully My intelligent friend Peter had rightly estimated the character of the man to whose honor he had intrusted us The next morning I was on deck as soon as the day dawned I called Fanny to see the sunrise for the first time in our lives on free soil for such I then believed it to be We watched the reddening sky and saw the great orb come up slowly out of the water as it seemed Soon the waves began to sparkle and every thing caught the beautiful glow Before us lay the city of strangers We looked at each other and the eyes of both were moistened with tears We had escaped from slavery and we supposed ourselves to be safe from the hunters But we were alone in the world and we had left dear ties behind us ties cruelly sundered by the demon Slavery XXXI INCIDENTS IN PHILADELPHIA I HAD heard that the poor slave had many friends at the north I trusted we should find some of them Meantime we would take it for granted that all were friends till they proved to the contrary I sought out the kind captain thanked him for his attentions and told him I should never cease to be grateful for the service he had rendered us I gave him a message to the friends I had left at home and he promised to deliver it We were placed in a row-boat and in about fifteen minutes were landed on a wood wharf in Philadelphia As I stood looking round the friendly captain touched me on the shoulder and said There is a respectable-looking colored man behind you I will speak to him about the New York trains and tell him you wish to go directly on I thanked him and asked him to direct me to some shops where I could buy gloves and veils He did so and said he would talk with the colored man till I returned I made what haste I could Constant exercise on board the vessel and frequent rubbing with salt water had nearly restored the use of my limbs The noise of the great city confused me but I found the shops and bought some double veils and gloves for Fanny and myself The shopman told me they were so many levies I had never heard the word before but I did not tell him so I thought if he knew I was a stranger he might ask me where I came from I gave him a gold piece and when he returned the change I counted it and found out how much a levy was I made my way back to the wharf where the captain introduced me to the colored man as the Rev Jeremiah Durham minister of Bethel church He took me by the hand as if I had been an old friend He told us we were too late for the morning cars to New York and must wait until the evening or the next morning He invited me to go home with him assuring me that his wife would give me a cordial welcome and for my friend he would provide a home with one of his neighbors I thanked him for so much kindness to strangers and told him if I must be detained I should like to hunt up some people who formerly went from our part of the country Mr Durham insisted that I should dine with him and then he would assist me in finding my friends The sailors came to bid us good by I shook their hardy hands with tears in my eyes They had all been kind to us and they had rendered us a greater service than they could possibly conceive of I had never seen so large a city or been in contact with so many people in the streets It seemed as if those who passed looked at us with an expression of curiosity My face was so blistered and peeled by sitting on deck in wind and sunshine that I thought they could not easily decide to what nation I belonged Mrs Durham met me with a kindly welcome without asking any questions I was tired and her friendly manner was a sweet refreshment God bless her I was sure that she had comforted other weary hearts before I received her sympathy She was surrounded by her husband and children in a home made sacred by protecting laws I thought of my own children and sighed After dinner Mr Durham went with me in quest of the friends I had spoken of They went from my native town and I anticipated much pleasure in looking on familiar faces They were not at home and we retraced our steps through streets delightfully clean On the way Mr Durham observed that I had spoken to him of a daughter I expected to meet that he was surprised for I looked so young he had taken me for a single woman He was approaching a subject on which I was extremely sensitive He would ask about my husband next I thought and if I answered him truly what would he think of me I told him I had two children one in New York the other at the south He asked some further questions and I frankly told him some of the most important events of my life It was painful for me to do it but I would not deceive him If he was desirous of being my friend I thought he ought to know how far I was worthy of it Excuse me if I have tried your feelings said he I did not question you from idle curiosity I wanted to understand your situation in order to know whether I could be of any service to you or your little girl Your straight-forward answers do you credit but don't answer every body so openly It might give some heartless people a pretext for treating you with contempt That word contempt burned me like coals of fire I replied God alone knows how I have suffered and He I trust will forgive me If I am permitted to have my children I intend to be a good mother and to live in such a manner that people cannot treat me with contempt I respect your sentiments said he Place your trust in God and be governed by good principles and you will not fail to find friends When we reached home I went to my room glad to shut out the world for a while The words he had spoken made an indelible impression upon me They brought up great shadows from the mournful past In the midst of my meditations I was startled by a knock at the door Mrs Durham entered her face all beaming with kindness to say that there was an anti-slavery friend down stairs who would like to see me I overcame my dread of encountering strangers and went with her Many questions were asked concerning my experiences and my escape from slavery but I observed how careful they all were not to say any thing that might wound my feelings How gratifying this was can be fully understood only by those who have been accustomed to be treated as if they were not included within the pale of human beings The anti-slavery friend had come to inquire into my plans and to offer assistance if needed Fanny was comfortably established for the present with a friend of Mr Durham The Anti-Slavery Society agreed to pay her expenses to New York The same was offered to me but I declined to accept it telling them that my grandmother had given me sufficient to pay my expenses to the end of my journey We were urged to remain in Philadelphia a few days until some suitable escort could be found for us I gladly accepted the proposition for I had a dread of meeting slaveholders and some dread also of railroads I had never entered a railroad car in my life and it seemed to me quite an important event That night I sought my pillow with feelings I had never carried to it before I verily believed myself to be a free woman I was wakeful for a long time and I had no sooner fallen asleep than I was roused by fire-bells I jumped up and hurried on my clothes Where I came from every body hastened to dress themselves on such occasions The white people thought a great fire might be used as a good opportunity for insurrection and that it was best to be in readiness and the colored people were ordered out to labor in extinguishing the flames There was but one engine in our town and colored women and children were often required to drag it to the river's edge and fill it Mrs Durham's daughter slept in the same room with me and seeing that she slept through all the din I thought it was my duty to wake her What's the matter said she rubbing her eyes They're screaming fire in the streets and the bells are ringing I replied What of that said she drowsily We are used to it We never get up without the fire is very near What good would it do I was quite surprised that it was not necessary for us to go and help fill the engine I was an ignorant child just beginning to learn how things went on in great cities At daylight I heard women crying fresh fish berries radishes and various other things All this was new to me I dressed myself at an early hour and sat at the window to watch that unknown tide of life Philadelphia seemed to be a wonderfully great place At the breakfast table my idea of going out to drag the engine was laughed over and I joined in the mirth I went to see Fanny and found her so well contented among her new friends that she was in no haste to leave I was also very happy with my kind hostess She had had advantages for education and was vastly my superior Every day almost every hour I was adding to my little stock of knowledge She took me out to see the city as much as she deemed prudent One day she took me to an artist's room and showed me the portraits of some of her children I had never seen any paintings of colored people before and they seemed to me beautiful At the end of five days one of Mrs Durham's friends offered to accompany us to New York the following morning As I held the hand of my good hostess in a parting clasp I longed to know whether her husband had repeated to her what I had told him I supposed he had but she never made any allusion to it I presume it was the delicate silence of womanly sympathy When Mr Durham handed us our tickets he said I am afraid you will have a disagreeable ride but I could not procure tickets for the first class cars Supposing I had not given him money enough I offered more O no said he they could not be had for any money They don't allow colored people to go in the first-class cars This was the first chill to my enthusiasm about the Free States Colored people were allowed to ride in a filthy box behind white people at the south but there they were not required to pay for the privilege It made me sad to find how the north aped the customs of slavery We were stowed away in a large rough car with windows on each side too high for us to look out without standing up It was crowded with people apparently of all nations There were plenty of beds and cradles containing screaming and kicking babies Every other man had a cigar or pipe in his mouth and jugs of whiskey were handed round freely The fumes of the whiskey and the dense tobacco smoke were sickening to my senses and my mind was equally nauseated by the coarse jokes and ribald songs around me It was a very disagreeable ride Since that time there has been some improvement in these matters XXXII THE MEETING OF MOTHER AND DAUGHTER When we arrived in New York I was half crazed by the crowd of coachmen calling out Carriage ma'am We bargained with one to take us to Sullivan Street for twelve shillings A burly Irishman stepped up and said I'll tak' ye for sax shillings The reduction of half the price was an object to us and we asked if he could take us right away Troth an I will ladies he replied I noticed that the hackmen smiled at each other and I inquired whether his conveyance was decent Yes it's dacent it is marm Devil a bit would I be after takin' ladies in a cab that was not dacent We gave him our checks He went for the baggage and soon reappeared saying This way if you plase ladies We followed and found our trunks on a truck and we were invited to take our seats on them We told him that was not what we bargained for and he must take the trunks off He swore they should not be touched till we had paid him six shillings In our situation it was not prudent to attract attention and I was about to pay him what he required when a man near by shook his head for me not to do it After a great ado we got rid of the Irishman and had our trunks fastened on a hack We had been recommended to a boarding-house in Sullivan Street and thither we drove There Fanny and I separated The Anti-Slavery Society provided a home for her and I afterwards heard of her in prosperous circumstances I sent for an old friend from my part of the country who had for some time been doing business in New York He came immediately I told him I wanted to go to my daughter and asked him to aid me in procuring an interview I cautioned him not to let it be known to the family that I had just arrived from the south because they supposed I had been at the north seven years He told me there was a colored woman in Brooklyn who came from the same town I did and I had better go to her house and have my daughter meet me there I accepted the proposition thankfully and he agreed to escort me to Brooklyn We crossed Fulton ferry went up Myrtle Avenue and stopped at the house he designated I was just about to enter when two girls passed My friend called my attention to them I turned and recognized in the eldest Sarah the daughter of a woman who used to live with my grandmother but who had left the south years ago Surprised and rejoiced at this unexpected meeting I threw my arms round her and inquired concerning her mother You take no notice of the other girl said my friend I turned and there stood my Ellen I pressed her to my heart then held her away from me to take a look at her She had changed a good deal in the two years since I parted from her Signs of neglect could be discerned by eyes less observing than a mother's My friend invited us all to go into the house but Ellen said she had been sent of an errand which she would do as quickly as possible and go home and ask Mrs Hobbs to let her come and see me It was agreed that I should send for her the next day Her companion Sarah hastened to tell her mother of my arrival When I entered the house I found the mistress of it absent and I waited for her return Before I saw her I heard her saying Where is Linda Brent I used to know her father and mother Soon Sarah came with her mother So there was quite a company of us all from my grandmother's neighborhood These friends gathered round me and questioned me eagerly They laughed they cried and they shouted They thanked God that I had got away from my persecutors and was safe on Long Island It was a day of great excitement How different from the silent days I had passed in my dreary den The next morning was Sunday My first waking thoughts were occupied with the note I was to send to Mrs Hobbs the lady with whom Ellen lived That I had recently come into that vicinity was evident otherwise I should have sooner inquired for my daughter It would not do to let them know I had just arrived from the south for that would involve the suspicion of my having been harbored there and might bring trouble if not ruin on several people I like a straightforward course and am always reluctant to resort to subterfuges So far as my ways have been crooked I charge them all upon slavery It was that system of violence and wrong which now left me no alternative but to enact a falsehood I began my note by stating that I had recently arrived from Canada and was very desirous to have my daughter come to see me She came and brought a message from Mrs Hobbs inviting me to her house and assuring me that I need not have any fears The conversation I had with my child did not leave my mind at ease When I asked if she was well treated she answered yes but there was no heartiness in the tone and it seemed to me that she said it from an unwillingness to have me troubled on her account Before she left me she asked very earnestly Mother when will you take me to live with you It made me sad to think that I could not give her a home till I went to work and earned the means and that might take me a long time When she was placed with Mrs Hobbs the agreement was that she should be sent to school She had been there two years and was now nine years old and she scarcely knew her letters There was no excuse for this for there were good public schools in Brooklyn to which she could have been sent without expense She staid with me till dark and I went home with her I was received in a friendly manner by the family and all agreed in saying that Ellen was a useful good girl Mrs Hobbs looked me coolly in the face and said I suppose you know that my cousin Mr Sands has given her to my eldest daughter She will make a nice waiting-maid for her when she grows up I did not answer a word How could she who knew by experience the strength of a mother's love and who was perfectly aware of the relation Mr Sands bore to my childrenhow could she look me in the face while she thrust such a dagger into my heart I was no longer surprised that they had kept her in such a state of ignorance Mr Hobbs had formerly been wealthy but he had failed and afterwards obtained a subordinate situation in the Custom House Perhaps they expected to return to the south some day and Ellen's knowledge was quite sufficient for a slave's condition I was impatient to go to work and earn money that I might change the uncertain position of my children Mr Sands had not kept his promise to emancipate them I had also been deceived about Ellen What security had I with regard to Benjamin I felt that I had none I returned to my friend's house in an uneasy state of mind In order to protect my children it was necessary that I should own myself I called myself free and sometimes felt so but I knew I was insecure I sat down that night and wrote a civil letter to Dr Flint asking him to state the lowest terms on which he would sell me and as I belonged by law to his daughter I wrote to her also making a similar request Since my arrival at the north I had not been unmindful of my dear brother William I had made diligent inquiries for him and having heard of him in Boston I went thither When I arrived there I found he had gone to New Bedford I wrote to that place and was informed he had gone on a whaling voyage and would not return for some months I went back to New York to get employment near Ellen I received an answer from Dr Flint which gave me no encouragement He advised me to return and submit myself to my rightful owners and then any request I might make would be granted I lent this letter to a friend who lost it otherwise I would present a copy to my readers XXXIII A HOME FOUND MY greatest anxiety now was to obtain employment My health was greatly improved though my limbs continued to trouble me with swelling whenever I walked much The greatest difficulty in my way was that those who employed strangers required a recommendation and in my peculiar position I could of course obtain no certificates from the families I had so faithfully served One day an acquaintance told me of a lady who wanted a nurse for her babe and I immediately applied for the situation The lady told me she preferred to have one who had been a mother and accustomed to the care of infants I told her I had nursed two babes of my own She asked me many questions but to my great relief did not require a recommendation from my former employers She told me she was an English woman and that was a pleasant circumstance to me because I had heard they had less prejudice against color than Americans entertained It was agreed that we should try each other for a week The trial proved satisfactory to both parties and I was engaged for a month The heavenly Father had been most merciful to me in leading me to this place Mrs Bruce was a kind and gentle lady and proved a true and sympathizing friend Before the stipulated month expired the necessity of passing up and down stairs frequently caused my limbs to swell so painfully that I became unable to perform my duties Many ladies would have thoughtlessly discharged me but Mrs Bruce made arrangements to save me steps and employed a physician to attend upon me I had not yet told her that I was a fugitive slave She noticed that I was often sad and kindly inquired the cause I spoke of being separated from my children and from relatives who were dear to me but I did not mention the constant feeling of insecurity which oppressed my spirits I longed for some one to confide in but I had been so deceived by white people that I had lost all confidence in them If they spoke kind words to me I thought it was for some selfish purpose I had entered this family with the distrustful feelings I had brought with me out of slavery but ere six months had passed I found that the gentle deportment of Mrs Bruce and the smiles of her lovely babe were thawing my chilled heart My narrow mind also began to expand under the influences of her intelligent conversation and the opportunities for reading which were gladly allowed me whenever I had leisure from my duties I gradually became more energetic and more cheerful The old feeling of insecurity especially with regard to my children often threw its dark shadow across my sunshine Mrs Bruce offered me a home for Ellen but pleasant as it would have been I did not dare to accept it for fear of offending the Hobbs family Their knowledge of my precarious situation placed me in their power and I felt that it was important for me to keep on the right side of them till by dint of labor and economy I could make a home for my children I was far from feeling satisfied with Ellen's situation She was not well cared for She sometimes came to New York to visit me but she generally brought a request from Mrs Hobbs that I would buy her a pair of shoes or some article of clothing This was accompanied by a promise of payment when Mr Hobbs's salary at the Custom House became due but some how or other the pay-day never came Thus many dollars of my earnings were expended to keep my child comfortably clothed That however was a slight trouble compared with the fear that their pecuniary embarrassments might induce them to sell my precious young daughter I knew they were in constant communication with Southerners and had frequent opportunities to do it I have stated that when Dr Flint put Ellen in jail at two years old she had an inflammation of the eyes occasioned by measles This disease still troubled her and kind Mrs Bruce proposed that she should come to New York for a while to be under the care of Dr Elliott a well known oculist It did not occur to me that there was any thing improper in a mother's making such a request but Mrs Hobbs was very angry and refused to let her go Situated as I was it was not politic to insist upon it I made no complaint but I longed to be entirely free to act a mother's part towards my children The next time I went over to Brooklyn Mrs Hobbs as if to apologize for her anger told me she had employed her own physician to attend to Ellen's eyes and that she had refused my request because she did not consider it safe to trust her in New York I accepted the explanation in silence but she had told me that my child belonged to her daughter and I suspected that her real motive was a fear of my conveying her property away from her Perhaps I did her injustice but my knowledge of Southerners made it difficult for me to feel otherwise Sweet and bitter were mixed in the cup of my life and I was thankful that it had ceased to be entirely bitter I loved Mrs Bruce's babe When it laughed and crowed in my face and twined its little tender arms confidingly about my neck it made me think of the time when Benny and Ellen were babies and my wounded heart was soothed One bright morning as I stood at the window tossing baby in my arms my attention was attracted by a young man in sailor's dress who was closely observing every house as he passed I looked at him earnestly Could it be my brother William It must be heand yet how changed I placed the baby safely flew down stairs opened the front door beckoned to the sailor and in less than a minute I was clasped in my brother's arms How much we had to tell each other How we laughed and how we cried over each other's adventures I took him to Brooklyn and again saw him with Ellen the dear child whom he had loved and tended so carefully while I was shut up in my miserable den He staid in New York a week His old feelings of affection for me and Ellen were as lively as ever There are no bonds so strong as those which are formed by suffering together XXXIV THE OLD ENEMY AGAIN MY young mistress Miss Emily Flint did not return any answer to my letter requesting her to consent to my being sold But after a while I received a reply which purported to be written by her younger brother In order rightly to enjoy the contents of this letter the reader must bear in mind that the Flint family supposed I had been at the north many years They had no idea that I knew of the doctor's three excursions to New York in search of me that I had heard his voice when he came to borrow five hundred dollars for that purpose and that I had seen him pass on his way to the steamboat Neither were they aware that all the particulars of aunt Nancy's death and burial were conveyed to me at the time they occurred I have kept the letter of which I herewith subjoin a copy Your letter to sister was received a few days ago I gather from it that you are desirous of returning to your native place among your friends and relatives We were all gratified with the contents of your letter and let me assure you that if any members of the family have had any feeling of resentment towards you they feel it no longer We all sympathize with you in your unfortunate condition and are ready to do all in our power to make you contented and happy It is difficult for you to return home as a free person If you were purchased by your grandmother it is doubtful whether you would be permitted to remain although it would be lawful for you to do so If a servant should be allowed to purchase herself after absenting herself so long from her owners and return free it would have an injurious effect From your letter I think your situation must be hard and uncomfortable Come home You have it in your power to be reinstated in our affections We would receive you with open arms and tears of joy You need not apprehend any unkind treatment as we have not put ourselves to any trouble or expense to get you Had we done so perhaps we should feel otherwise You know my sister was always attached to you and that you were never treated as a slave You were never put to hard work nor exposed to field labor On the contrary you were taken into the house and treated as one of us and almost as free and we at least felt that you were above disgracing yourself by running away Believing you may be induced to come home voluntarily has induced me to write for my sister The family will be rejoiced to see you and your poor old grandmother expressed a great desire to have you come when she heard your letter read In her old age she needs the consolation of having her children round her Doubtless you have heard of the death of your aunt She was a faithful servant and a faithful member of the Episcopal church In her Christian life she taught us how to liveand O too high the price of knowledge she taught us how to die Could you have seen us round her death bed with her mother all mingling our tears in one common stream you would have thought the same heartfelt tie existed between a master and his servant as between a mother and her child But this subject is too painful to dwell upon I must bring my letter to a close If you are contented to stay away from your old grandmother your child and the friends who love you stay where you are We shall never trouble ourselves to apprehend you But should you prefer to come home we will do all that we can to make you happy If you do not wish to remain in the family I know that father by our persuasion will be induced to let you be purchased by any person you may choose in our community You will please answer this as soon as possible and let us know your decision Sister sends much love to you In the mean time believe me your sincere friend and well wisher This letter was signed by Emily's brother who was as yet a mere lad I knew by the style that it was not written by a person of his age and though the writing was disguised I had been made too unhappy by it in former years not to recognize at once the hand of Dr Flint O the hypocrisy of slaveholders Did the old fox suppose I was goose enough to go into such a trap Verily he relied too much on the stupidity of the African race I did not return the family of Flints any thanks for their cordial invitationa remissness for which I was no doubt charged with base ingratitude Not long afterwards I received a letter from one of my friends at the south informing me that Dr Flint was about to visit the north The letter had been delayed and I supposed he might be already on the way Mrs Bruce did not know I was a fugitive I told her that important business called me to Boston where my brother then was and asked permission to bring a friend to supply my place as nurse for a fortnight I started on my journey immediately and as soon as I arrived I wrote to my grandmother that if Benny came he must be sent to Boston I knew she was only waiting for a good chance to send him north and fortunately she had the legal power to do so without asking leave of any body She was a free woman and when my children were purchased Mr Sands preferred to have the bill of sale drawn up in her name It was conjectured that he advanced the money but it was not known At the south a gentleman may have a shoal of colored children without any disgrace but if he is known to purchase them with the view of setting them free the example is thought to be dangerous to their peculiar institution and he becomes unpopular There was a good opportunity to send Benny in a vessel coming directly to New York He was put on board with a letter to a friend who was requested to see him off to Boston Early one morning there was a loud rap at my door and in rushed Benjamin all out of breath O mother he exclaimed here I am I run all the way and I come all alone How d'you do O reader can you imagine my joy No you cannot unless you have been a slave mother Benjamin rattled away as fast as his tongue could go Mother why don't you bring Ellen here I went over to Brooklyn to see her and she felt very bad when I bid her good by She said 'O Ben I wish I was going too' I thought she'd know ever so much but she don't know so much as I do for I can read and she can't And mother I lost all my clothes coming What can I do to get some more I 'spose free boys can get along here at the north as well as white boys I did not like to tell the sanguine happy little fellow how much he was mistaken I took him to a tailor and procured a change of clothes The rest of the day was spent in mutual asking and answering of questions with the wish constantly repeated that the good old grandmother was with us and frequent injunctions from Benny to write to her immediately and be sure to tell her every thing about his voyage and his journey to Boston Dr Flint made his visit to New York and made every exertion to call upon me and invite me to return with him but not being able to ascertain where I was his hospitable intentions were frustrated and the affectionate family who were waiting for me with open arms were doomed to disappointment As soon as I knew he was safely at home I placed Benjamin in the care of my brother William and returned to Mrs Bruce There I remained through the winter and spring endeavoring to perform my duties faithfully and finding a good degree of happiness in the attractions of baby Mary the considerate kindness of her excellent mother and occasional interviews with my darling daughter But when summer came the old feeling of insecurity haunted me It was necessary for me to take little Mary out daily for exercise and fresh air and the city was swarming with Southerners some of whom might recognize me Hot weather brings out snakes and slaveholders and I like one class of the venomous creatures as little as I do the other What a comfort it is to be free to say so XXXV PREJUDICE AGAINST COLOR IT was a relief to my mind to see preparations for leaving the city We went to Albany in the steamboat Knickerbocker When the gong sounded for tea Mrs Bruce said Linda it is late and you and baby had better come to the table with me I replied I know it is time baby had her supper but I had rather not go with you if you please I am afraid of being insulted O no not if you are with me she said I saw several white nurses go with their ladies and I ventured to do the same We were at the extreme end of the table I was no sooner seated than a gruff voice said Get up You know you are not allowed to sit here I looked up and to my astonishment and indignation saw that the speaker was a colored man If his office required him to enforce the by-laws of the boat he might at least have done it politely I replied I shall not get up unless the captain comes and takes me up No cup of tea was offered me but Mrs Bruce handed me hers and called for another I looked to see whether the other nurses were treated in a similar manner They were all properly waited on Next morning when we stopped at Troy for breakfast every body was making a rush for the table Mrs Bruce said Take my arm Linda and we'll go in together The landlord heard her and said Madam will you allow your nurse and baby to take breakfast with my family I knew this was to be attributed to my complexion but he spoke courteously and therefore I did not mind it At Saratoga we found the United States Hotel crowded and Mr Bruce took one of the cottages belonging to the hotel I had thought with gladness of going to the quiet of the country where I should meet few people but here I found myself in the midst of a swarm of Southerners I looked round me with fear and trembling dreading to see some one who would recognize me I was rejoiced to find that we were to stay but a short time We soon returned to New York to make arrangements for spending the remainder of the summer at Rockaway While the laundress was putting the clothes in order I took an opportunity to go over to Brooklyn to see Ellen I met her going to a grocery store and the first words she said were O mother don't go to Mrs Hobbs's Her brother Mr Thorne has come from the south and may be he'll tell where you are I accepted the warning I told her I was going away with Mrs Bruce the next day and would try to see her when I came back Being in servitude to the Anglo-Saxon race I was not put into a Jim Crow car on our way to Rockaway neither was I invited to ride through the streets on the top of trunks in a truck but every where I found the same manifestations of that cruel prejudice which so discourages the feelings and represses the energies of the colored people We reached Rockaway before dark and put up at the Paviliona large hotel beautifully situated by the sea-sidea great resort of the fashionable world Thirty or forty nurses were there of a great variety of nations Some of the ladies had colored waiting-maids and coachmen but I was the only nurse tinged with the blood of Africa When the tea bell rang I took little Mary and followed the other nurses Supper was served in a long hall A young man who had the ordering of things took the circuit of the table two or three times and finally pointed me to a seat at the lower end of it As there was but one chair I sat down and took the child in my lap Whereupon the young man came to me and said in the blandest manner possible Will you please to seat the little girl in the chair and stand behind it and feed her After they have done you will be shown to the kitchen where you will have a good supper This was the climax I found it hard to preserve my self-control when I looked round and saw women who were nurses as I was and only one shade lighter in complexion eyeing me with a defiant look as if my presence were a contamination However I said nothing I quietly took the child in my arms went to our room and refused to go to the table again Mr Bruce ordered meals to be sent to the room for little Mary and I This answered for a few days but the waiters of the establishment were white and they soon began to complain saying they were not hired to wait on negroes The landlord requested Mr Bruce to send me down to my meals because his servants rebelled against bringing them up and the colored servants of other boarders were dissatisfied because all were not treated alike My answer was that the colored servants ought to be dissatisfied with themselves for not having too much self-respect to submit to such treatment that there was no difference in the price of board for colored and white servants and there was no justification for difference of treatment I staid a month after this and finding I was resolved to stand up for my rights they concluded to treat me well Let every colored man and woman do this and eventually we shall cease to be trampled under foot by our oppressors XXXVI THE HAIRBREADTH ESCAPE AFTER we returned to New York I took the earliest opportunity to go and see Ellen I asked to have her called down stairs for I supposed Mrs Hobbs's southern brother might still be there and I was desirous to avoid seeing him if possible But Mrs Hobbs came to the kitchen and insisted on my going up stairs My brother wants to see you said she and he is sorry you seem to shun him He knows you are living in New York He told me to say to you that he owes thanks to good old aunt Martha for too many little acts of kindness for him to be base enough to betray her grandchild This Mr Thorne had become poor and reckless long before he left the south and such persons had much rather go to one of the faithful old slaves to borrow a dollar or get a good dinner than to go to one whom they consider an equal It was such acts of kindness as these for which he professed to feel grateful to my grandmother I wished he had kept at a distance but as he was here and knew where I was I concluded there was nothing to be gained by trying to avoid him on the contrary it might be the means of exciting his ill will I followed his sister up stairs He met me in a very friendly manner congratulated me on my escape from slavery and hoped I had a good place where I felt happy I continued to visit Ellen as often as I could She good thoughtful child never forgot my hazardous situation but always kept a vigilant lookout for my safety She never made any complaint about her own inconveniences and troubles but a mother's observing eye easily perceived that she was not happy On the occasion of one of my visits I found her unusually serious When I asked her what was the matter she said nothing was the matter But I insisted upon knowing what made her look so very grave Finally I ascertained that she felt troubled about the dissipation that was continually going on in the house She was sent to the store very often for rum and brandy and she felt ashamed to ask for it so often and Mr Hobbs and Mr Thorne drank a great deal and their hands trembled so that they had to call her to pour out the liquor for them But for all that said she Mr Hobbs is good to me and I can't help liking him I feel sorry for him I tried to comfort her by telling her that I had laid up a hundred dollars and that before long I hoped to be able to give her and Benjamin a home and send them to school She was always desirous not to add to my troubles more than she could help and I did not discover till years afterwards that Mr Thorne's intemperance was not the only annoyance she suffered from him Though he professed too much gratitude to my grandmother to injure any of her descendants he had poured vile language into the ears of her innocent great-grandchild I usually went to Brooklyn to spend Sunday afternoon One Sunday I found Ellen anxiously waiting for me near the house O mother said she I've been waiting for you this long time I'm afraid Mr Thorne has written to tell Dr Flint where you are Make haste and come in Mrs Hobbs will tell you all about it The story was soon told While the children were playing in the grape-vine arbor the day before Mr Thorne came out with a letter in his hand which he tore up and scattered about Ellen was sweeping the yard at the time and having her mind full of suspicions of him she picked up the pieces and carried them to the children saying I wonder who Mr Thorne has been writing to I'm sure I don't know and don't care replied the oldest of the children and I don't see how it concerns you But it does concern me replied Ellen for I'm afraid he's been writing to the south about my mother They laughed at her and called her a silly thing but good-naturedly put the fragments of writing together in order to read them to her They were no sooner arranged than the little girl exclaimed I declare Ellen I believe you are right The contents of Mr Thorne's letter as nearly as I can remember were as follows I have seen your slave Linda and conversed with her She can be taken very easily if you manage prudently There are enough of us here to swear to her identity as your property I am a patriot a lover of my country and I do this as an act of justice to the laws He concluded by informing the doctor of the street and number where I lived The children carried the pieces to Mrs Hobbs who immediately went to her brother's room for an explanation He was not to be found The servants said they saw him go out with a letter in his hand and they supposed he had gone to the post office The natural inference was that he had sent to Dr Flint a copy of those fragments When he returned his sister accused him of it and he did not deny the charge He went immediately to his room and the next morning he was missing He had gone over to New York before any of the family were astir It was evident that I had no time to lose and I hastened back to the city with a heavy heart Again I was to be torn from a comfortable home and all my plans for the welfare of my children were to be frustrated by that demon Slavery I now regretted that I never told Mrs Bruce my story I had not concealed it merely on account of being a fugitive that would have made her anxious but it would have excited sympathy in her kind heart I valued her good opinion and I was afraid of losing it if I told her all the particulars of my sad story But now I felt that it was necessary for her to know how I was situated I had once left her abruptly without explaining the reason and it would not be proper to do it again I went home resolved to tell her in the morning But the sadness of my face attracted her attention and in answer to her kind inquiries I poured out my full heart to her before bed time She listened with true womanly sympathy and told me she would do all she could to protect me How my heart blessed her Early the next morning Judge Vanderpool and Lawyer Hopper were consulted They said I had better leave the city at once as the risk would be great if the case came to trial Mrs Bruce took me in a carriage to the house of one of her friends where she assured me I should be safe until my brother could arrive which would be in a few days In the interval my thoughts were much occupied with Ellen She was mine by birth and she was also mine by Southern law since my grandmother held the bill of sale that made her so I did not feel that she was safe unless I had her with me Mrs Hobbs who felt badly about her brother's treachery yielded to my entreaties on condition that she should return in ten days I avoided making any promise She came to me clad in very thin garments all outgrown and with a school satchel on her arm containing a few articles It was late in October and I knew the child must suffer and not daring to go out in the streets to purchase any thing I took off my own flannel skirt and converted it into one for her Kind Mrs Bruce came to bid me good by and when she saw that I had taken off my clothing for my child the tears came to her eyes She said Wait for me Linda and went out She soon returned with a nice warm shawl and hood for Ellen Truly of such souls as hers are the kingdom of heaven My brother reached New York on Wednesday Lawyer Hopper advised us to go to Boston by the Stonington route as there was less Southern travel in that direction Mrs Bruce directed her servants to tell all inquirers that I formerly lived there but had gone from the city We reached the steamboat Rhode Island in safety That boat employed colored hands but I knew that colored passengers were not admitted to the cabin I was very desirous for the seclusion of the cabin not only on account of exposure to the night air but also to avoid observation Lawyer Hopper was waiting on board for us He spoke to the stewardess and asked as a particular favor that she would treat us well He said to me Go and speak to the captain yourself by and by Take your little girl with you and I am sure that he will not let her sleep on deck With these kind words and a shake of the hand he departed The boat was soon on her way bearing me rapidly from the friendly home where I had hoped to find security and rest My brother had left me to purchase the tickets thinking that I might have better success than he would When the stewardess came to me I paid what she asked and she gave me three tickets with clipped corners In the most unsophisticated manner I said You have made a mistake I asked you for cabin tickets I cannot possibly consent to sleep on deck with my little daughter She assured me there was no mistake She said on some of the routes colored people were allowed to sleep in the cabin but not on this route which was much travelled by the wealthy I asked her to show me to the captain's office and she said she would after tea When the time came I took Ellen by the hand and went to the captain politely requesting him to change our tickets as we should be very uncomfortable on deck He said it was contrary to their custom but he would see that we had berths below he would also try to obtain comfortable seats for us in the cars of that he was not certain but he would speak to the conductor about it when the boat arrived I thanked him and returned to the ladies' cabin He came afterwards and told me that the conductor of the cars was on board that he had spoken to him and he had promised to take care of us I was very much surprised at receiving so much kindness I don't know whether the pleasing face of my little girl had won his heart or whether the stewardess inferred from Lawyer Hopper's manner that I was a fugitive and had pleaded with him in my behalf When the boat arrived at Stonington the conductor kept his promise and showed us to seats in the first car nearest the engine He asked us to take seats next the door but as he passed through we ventured to move on toward the other end of the car No incivility was offered us and we reached Boston in safety The day after my arrival was one of the happiest of my life I felt as if I was beyond the reach of the bloodhounds and for the first time during many years I had both my children together with me They greatly enjoyed their reunion and laughed and chatted merrily I watched them with a swelling heart Their every motion delighted me I could not feel safe in New York and I accepted the offer of a friend that we should share expenses and keep house together I represented to Mrs Hobbs that Ellen must have some schooling and must remain with me for that purpose She felt ashamed of being unable to read or spell at her age so instead of sending her to school with Benny I instructed her myself till she was fitted to enter an intermediate school The winter passed pleasantly while I was busy with my needle and my children with their books XXXVII A VISIT TO ENGLAND IN the spring sad news came to me Mrs Bruce was dead Never again in this world should I see her gentle face or hear her sympathizing voice I had lost an excellent friend and little Mary had lost a tender mother Mr Bruce wished the child to visit some of her mother's relatives in England and he was desirous that I should take charge of her The little motherless one was accustomed to me and attached to me and I thought she would be happier in my care than in that of a stranger I could also earn more in this way than I could by my needle So I put Benny to a trade and left Ellen to remain in the house with my friend and go to school We sailed from New York and arrived in Liverpool after a pleasant voyage of twelve days We proceeded directly to London and took lodgings at the Adelaide Hotel The supper seemed to me less luxurious than those I had seen in American hotels but my situation was indescribably more pleasant For the first time in my life I was in a place where I was treated according to my deportment without reference to my complexion I felt as if a great millstone had been lifted from my breast Ensconced in a pleasant room with my dear little charge I laid my head on my pillow for the first time with the delightful consciousness of pure unadulterated freedom As I had constant care of the child I had little opportunity to see the wonders of that great city but I watched the tide of life that flowed through the streets and found it a strange contrast to the stagnation in our Southern towns Mr Bruce took his little daughter to spend some days with friends in Oxford Crescent and of course it was necessary for me to accompany her I had heard much of the systematic method of English education and I was very desirous that my dear Mary should steer straight in the midst of so much propriety I closely observed her little playmates and their nurses being ready to take any lessons in the science of good management The children were more rosy than American children but I did not see that they differed materially in other respects They were like all childrensometimes docile and sometimes wayward We next went to Steventon in Berkshire It was a small town said to be the poorest in the county I saw men working in the fields for six shillings and seven shillings a week and women for sixpence and sevenpence a day out of which they boarded themselves Of course they lived in the most primitive manner it could not be otherwise where a woman's wages for an entire day were not sufficient to buy a pound of meat They paid very low rents and their clothes were made of the cheapest fabrics though much better than could have been procured in the United States for the same money I had heard much about the oppression of the poor in Europe The people I saw around me were many of them among the poorest poor But when I visited them in their little thatched cottages I felt that the condition of even the meanest and most ignorant among them was vastly superior to the condition of the most favored slaves in America They labored hard but they were not ordered out to toil while the stars were in the sky and driven and slashed by an overseer through heat and cold till the stars shone out again Their homes were very humble but they were protected by law No insolent patrols could come in the dead of night and flog them at their pleasure The father when he closed his cottage door felt safe with his family around him No master or overseer could come and take from him his wife or his daughter They must separate to earn their living but the parents knew where their children were going and could communicate with them by letters The relations of husband and wife parent and child were too sacred for the richest noble in the land to violate with impunity Much was being done to enlighten these poor people Schools were established among them and benevolent societies were active in efforts to ameliorate their condition There was no law forbidding them to learn to read and write and if they helped each other in spelling out the Bible they were in no danger of thirty-nine lashes as was the case with myself and poor pious old uncle Fred I repeat that the most ignorant and the most destitute of these peasants was a thousand fold better off than the most pampered American slave I do not deny that the poor are oppressed in Europe I am not disposed to paint their condition so rose-colored as the Hon Miss Murray paints the condition of the slaves in the United States A small portion of my experience would enable her to read her own s with anointed eyes If she were to lay aside her title and instead of visiting among the fashionable become domesticated as a poor governess on some plantation in Louisiana or Alabama she would see and hear things that would make her tell quite a different story My visit to England is a memorable event in my life from the fact of my having there received strong religious impressions The contemptuous manner in which the communion had been administered to colored people in my native place the church membership of Dr Flint and others like him and the buying and selling of slaves by professed ministers of the gospel had given me a prejudice against the Episcopal church The whole service seemed to me a mockery and a sham But my home in Steventon was in the family of a clergyman who was a true disciple of Jesus The beauty of his daily life inspired me with faith in the gentleness of Christian professions Grace entered my heart and I knelt at the communion table I trust in true humility of soul I remained abroad ten months which was much longer than I had anticipated During all that time I never saw the slightest symptom of prejudice against color Indeed I entirely forgot it till the time came for us to return to America XXXVIII RENEWED INVITATIONS TO GO SOUTH WE had a tedious winter passage and from the distance spectres seemed to rise up on the shores of the United States It is a sad feeling to be afraid of one's native country We arrived in New York safely and I hastened to Boston to look after my children I found Ellen well and improving at her school but Benny was not there to welcome me He had been left at a good place to learn a trade and for several months every thing worked well He was liked by the master and was a favorite with his fellow apprentices but one day they accidentally discovered a fact they had never before suspectedthat he was colored This at once transformed him into a different being Some of the apprentices were Americans others American-born Irish and it was offensive to their dignity to have a nigger among them after they had been told that he was a nigger They began by treating him with silent scorn and finding that he returned the same they resorted to insults and abuse He was too spirited a boy to stand that and he went off Being desirous to do something to support himself and having no one to advise him he shipped for a whaling voyage When I received these tidings I shed many tears and bitterly reproached myself for having left him so long But I had done it for the best and now all I could do was to pray to the heavenly Father to guide and protect him Not long after my return I received the following letter from Miss Emily Flint now Mrs Dodge In this you will recognize the hand of your friend and mistress Having heard that you had gone with a family to Europe I have waited to hear of your return to write to you I should have answered the letter you wrote to me long since but as I could not then act independently of my father I knew there could be nothing done satisfactory to you There were persons here who were willing to buy you and run the risk of getting you To this I would not consent I have always been attached to you and would not like to see you the slave of another or have unkind treatment I am married now and can protect you My husband expects to move to Virginia this spring where we think of settling I am very anxious that you should come and live with me If you are not willing to come you may purchase yourself but I should prefer having you live with me If you come you may if you like spend a month with your grandmother and friends then come to me in Norfolk Virginia Think this over and write as soon as possible and let me know the conclusion Hoping that your children are well I remain you friend and mistress Of course I did not write to return thanks for this cordial invitation I felt insulted to be thought stupid enough to be caught by such professions 'Come up into my parlor' said the spider to the fly ''Tis the prettiest little parlor that ever you did spy' It was plain that Dr Flint's family were apprised of my movements since they knew of my voyage to Europe I expected to have further trouble from them but having eluded them thus far I hoped to be as successful in future The money I had earned I was desirous to devote to the education of my children and to secure a home for them It seemed not only hard but unjust to pay for myself I could not possibly regard myself as a piece of property Moreover I had worked many years without wages and during that time had been obliged to depend on my grandmother for many comforts in food and clothing My children certainly belonged to me but though Dr Flint had incurred no expense for their support he had received a large sum of money for them I knew the law would decide that I was his property and would probably still give his daughter a claim to my children but I regarded such laws as the regulations of robbers who had no rights that I was bound to respect The Fugitive Slave Law had not then passed The judges of Massachusetts had not then stooped under chains to enter her courts of justice so called I knew my old master was rather skittish of Massachusetts I relied on her love of freedom and felt safe on her soil I am now aware that I honored the old Commonwealth beyond her deserts XXXIX THE CONFESSION FOR two years my daughter and I supported ourselves comfortably in Boston At the end of that time my brother William offered to send Ellen to a boarding school It required a great effort for me to consent to part with her for I had few near ties and it was her presence that made my two little rooms seem home-like But my judgment prevailed over my selfish feelings I made preparations for her departure During the two years we had lived together I had often resolved to tell her something about her father but I had never been able to muster sufficient courage I had a shrinking dread of diminishing my child's love I knew she must have curiosity on the subject but she had never asked a question She was always very careful not to say any thing to remind me of my troubles Now that she was going from me I thought if I should die before she returned she might hear my story from some one who did not understand the palliating circumstances and that if she were entirely ignorant on the subject her sensitive nature might receive a rude shock When we retired for the night she said Mother it is very hard to leave you alone I am almost sorry I am going though I do want to improve myself But you will write to me often won't you mother I did not throw my arms round her I did not anwer her But in a calm solemn way for it cost me great effort I said Listen to me Ellen I have something to tell you I recounted my early sufferings in slavery and told her how nearly they had crushed me I began to tell her how they had driven me into a great sin when she clasped me in her arms and exclaimed O don't mother Please don't tell me any more I said But my child I want you to know about your father I know all about it mother she replied I am nothing to my father and he is nothing to me All my love is for you I was with him five months in Washington and he never cared for me He never spoke to me as he did to his little Fanny I knew all the time he was my father for Fanny's nurse told me so but she said I must never tell any body and I never did I used to wish he would take me in his arms and kiss me as he did Fanny or that he would sometimes smile at me as he did at her I thought if he was my own father he ought to love me I was a little girl then and didn't know any better But now I never think any thing about my father All my love is for you She hugged me closer as she spoke and I thanked God that the knowledge I had so much dreaded to impart had not diminished the affection of my child I had not the slightest idea she knew that portion of my history If I had I should have spoken to her long before for my pent-up feelings had often longed to pour themselves out to some one I could trust But I loved the dear girl better for the delicacy she had manifested towards her unfortunate mother The next morning she and her uncle started on their journey to the village in New York where she was to be placed at school It seemed as if all the sunshine had gone away My little room was dreadfully lonely I was thankful when a message came from a lady accustomed to employ me requesting me to come and sew in her family for several weeks On my return I found a letter from brother William He thought of opening an anti-slavery reading room in Rochester and combining with it the sale of some books and stationery and he wanted me to unite with him We tried it but it was not successful We found warm anti-slavery friends there but the feeling was not general enough to support such an establishment I passed nearly a year in the family of Isaac and Amy Post practical believers in the Christian doctrine of human brotherhood They measured a man's worth by his character not by his complexion The memory of those beloved and honored friends will remain with me to my latest hour XL THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW MY brother being disappointed in his project concluded to go to California and it was agreed that Benjamin should go with him Ellen liked her school and was a great favorite there They did not know her history and she did not tell it because she had no desire to make capital out of their sympathy But when it was accidentally discovered that her mother was a fugitive slave every method was used to increase her advantages and diminish her expenses I was alone again It was necessary for me to be earning money and I preferred that it should be among those who knew me On my return from Rochester I called at the house of Mr Bruce to see Mary the darling little babe that had thawed my heart when it was freezing into a cheerless distrust of all my fellow-beings She was growing a tall girl now but I loved her always Mr Bruce had married again and it was proposed that I should become nurse to a new infant I had but one hesitation and that was my feeling of insecurity in New York now greatly increased by the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law However I resolved to try the experiment I was again fortunate in my employer The new Mrs Bruce was an American brought up under aristocratic influences and still living in the midst of them but if she had any prejudice against color I was never made aware of it and as for the system of slavery she had a most hearty dislike of it No sophistry of Southerners could blind her to its enormity She was a person of excellent principles and a noble heart To me from that hour to the present she has been a true and sympathizing friend Blessings be with her and hers About the time that I rentered the Bruce family an event occurred of disastrous import to the colored people The slave Hamlin the first fugitive that came under the new law was given up by the bloodhounds of the north to the bloodhounds of the south It was the beginning of a reign of terror to the colored population The great city rushed on in its whirl of excitement taking no note of the short and simple annals of the poor But while fashionables were listening to the thrilling voice of Jenny Lind in Metropolitan Hall the thrilling voices of poor hunted colored people went up in an agony of supplication to the Lord from Zion's church Many families who had lived in the city for twenty years fled from it now Many a poor washerwoman who by hard labor had made herself a comfortable home was obliged to sacrifice her furniture bid a hurried farewell to friends and seek her fortune among strangers in Canada Many a wife discovered a secret she had never known beforethat her husband was a fugitive and must leave her to insure his own safety Worse still many a husband discovered that his wife had fled from slavery years ago and as the child follows the condition of its mother the children of his love were liable to be seized and carried into slavery Every where in those humble homes there was consternation and anguish But what cared the legislators of the dominant race for the blood they were crushing out of trampled hearts When my brother William spent his last evening with me before he went to California we talked nearly all the time of the distress brought on our oppressed people by the passage of this iniquitous law and never had I seen him manifest such bitterness of spirit such stern hostility to our oppressors He was himself free from the operation of the law for he did not run from any Slaveholding State being brought into the Free States by his master But I was subject to it and so were hundreds of intelligent and industrious people all around us I seldom ventured into the streets and when it was necessary to do an errand for Mrs Bruce or any of the family I went as much as possible through back streets and by-ways What a disgrace to a city calling itself free that inhabitants guiltless of offence and seeking to perform their duties conscientiously should be condemned to live in such incessant fear and have nowhere to turn for protection This state of things of course gave rise to many impromptu vigilance committees Every colored person and every friend of their persecuted race kept their eyes wide open Every evening I examined the newspapers carefully to see what Southerners had put up at the hotels I did this for my own sake thinking my young mistress and her husband might be among the list I wished also to give information to others if necessary for if many were running to and fro I resolved that knowledge should be increased This brings up one of my Southern reminiscences which I will here briefly relate I was somewhat acquainted with a slave named Luke who belonged to a wealthy man in our vicinity His master died leaving a son and daughter heirs to his large fortune In the division of the slaves Luke was included in the son's portion This young man became a prey to the vices growing out of the patriarchal institution and when he went to the north to complete his education he carried his vices with him He was brought home deprived of the use of his limbs by excessive dissipation Luke was appointed to wait upon his bed-ridden master whose despotic habits were greatly increased by exasperation at his own helplessness He kept a cowhide beside him and for the most trivial occurrence he would order his attendant to bare his back and kneel beside the couch while he whipped him till his strength was exhausted Some days he was not allowed to wear any thing but his shirt in order to be in readiness to be flogged A day seldom passed without his receiving more or less blows If the slightest resistance was offered the town constable was sent for to execute the punishment and Luke learned from experience how much more the constable's strong arm was to be dreaded than the comparatively feeble one of his master The arm of his tyrant grew weak and was finally palsied and then the constable's services were in constant requisition The fact that he was entirely dependent on Luke's care and was obliged to be tended like an infant instead of inspiring any gratitude or compassion towards his poor slave seemed only to increase his irritability and cruelty As he lay there on his bed a mere disgraced wreck of manhood he took into his head the strangest freaks of despotism and if Luke hesitated to submit to his orders the constable was immediately sent for Some of these freaks were of a nature too filthy to be repeated When I fled from the house of bondage I left poor Luke still chained to the bedside of this cruel and disgusting wretch One day when I had been requested to do an errand for Mrs Bruce I was hurrying through back streets as usual when I saw a young man approaching whose face was familiar to me As he came nearer I recognized Luke I always rejoiced to see or hear of any one who had escaped from the black pit but remembering this poor fellow's extreme hardships I was peculiarly glad to see him on Northern soil though I no longer called it free soil I well remembered what a desolate feeling it was to be alone among strangers and I went up to him and greeted him cordially At first he did not know me but when I mentioned my name he remembered all about me I told him of the Fugitive Slave Law and asked him if he did not know that New York was a city of kidnappers He replied De risk ain't so bad for me as 'tis fur you 'Cause I runned away from de speculator and you runned away from de massa Dem speculators vont spen dar money to come here fur a runaway if dey ain't sartin sure to put dar hans right on him An I tell you I's tuk good car 'bout dat I had too hard times down dar to let 'em ketch dis nigger He then told me of the advice he had received and the plans he had laid I asked if he had money enough to take him to Canada 'Pend upon it I hab he replied I tuk car fur dat I'd bin workin all my days fur dem cussed whites an got no pay but kicks and cuffs So I tought dis nigger had a right to money nuff to bring him to de Free States Massa Henry he lib till ebery body vish him dead an ven he did die I knowed de debbil would hab him an vouldn't vant him to bring his money 'long too So I tuk some of his bills and put 'em in de pocket of his ole trousers An ven he was buried dis nigger ask fur dem ole trousers an dey gub 'em to me With a low chuckling laugh he added You see I didn't steal it dey gub it to me I tell you I had mighty hard time to keep de speculator from findin it but he didn't git it This is a fair specimen of how the moral sense is educated by slavery When a man has his wages stolen from him year after year and the laws sanction and enforce the theft how can he be expected to have more regard to honesty than has the man who robs him I have become somewhat enlightened but I confess that I agree with poor ignorant much-abused Luke in thinking he had a right to that money as a portion of his unpaid wages He went to Canada forthwith and I have not since heard from him All that winter I lived in a state of anxiety When I took the children out to breathe the air I closely observed the countenances of all I met I dreaded the approach of summer when snakes and slaveholders make their appearance I was in fact a slave in New York as subject to slave laws as I had been in a Slave State Strange incongruity in a State called free Spring returned and I received warning from the south that Dr Flint knew of my return to my old place and was making preparations to have me caught I learned afterwards that my dress and that of Mrs Bruce's children had been described to him by some of the Northern tools which slaveholders employ for their base purposes and then indulge in sneers at their cupidity and mean servility I immediately informed Mrs Bruce of my danger and she took prompt measures for my safety My place as nurse could not be supplied immediately and this generous sympathizing lady proposed that I should carry her baby away It was a comfort to me to have the child with me for the heart is reluctant to be torn away from every object it loves But how few mothers would have consented to have one of their own babes become a fugitive for the sake of a poor hunted nurse on whom the legislators of the country had let loose the bloodhounds When I spoke of the sacrifice she was making in depriving herself of her dear baby she replied It is better for you to have baby with you Linda for if they get on your track they will be obliged to bring the child to me and then if there is a possibility of saving you you shall be saved This lady had a very wealthy relative a benevolent gentleman in many respects but aristocratic and pro-slavery He remonstrated with her for harboring a fugitive slave told her she was violating the laws of her country and asked her if she was aware of the penalty She replied I am very well aware of it It is imprisonment and one thousand dollars fine Shame on my country that it is so I am ready to incur the penalty I will go to the state's prison rather than have any poor victim torn from my house to be carried back to slavery The noble heart The brave heart The tears are in my eyes while I write of her May the God of the helpless reward her for her sympathy with my persecuted people I was sent into New England where I was sheltered by the wife of a senator whom I shall always hold in grateful remembrance This honorable gentleman would not have voted for the Fugitive Slave Law as did the senator in Uncle Tom's Cabin on the contrary he was strongly opposed to it but he was enough under its influence to be afraid of having me remain in his house many hours So I was sent into the country where I remained a month with the baby When it was supposed that Dr Flint's emissaries had lost track of me and given up the pursuit for the present I returned to New York XLI FREE AT LAST MRS BRUCE and every member of her family were exceedingly kind to me I was thankful for the blessings of my lot yet I could not always wear a cheerful countenance I was doing harm to no one on the contrary I was doing all the good I could in my small way yet I could never go out to breathe God's free air without trepidation at my heart This seemed hard and I could not think it was a right state of things in any civilized country From time to time I received news from my good old grandmother She could not write but she employed others to write for her The following is an extract from one of her last letters Dear Daughter I cannot hope to see you again on earth but I pray to God to unite us above where pain will no more rack this feeble body of mine where sorrow and parting from my children will be no more God has promised these things if we are faithful unto the end My age and feeble health deprive me of going to church now but God is with me here at home Thank your brother for his kindness Give much love to him and tell him to remember the Creator in the days of his youth and strive to meet me in the Father's kingdom Love to Ellen and Benjamin Don't neglect him Tell him for me to be a good boy Strive my child to train them for God's children May he protect and provide for you is the prayer of your loving old mother These letters both cheered and saddened me I was always glad to have tidings from the kind faithful old friend of my unhappy youth but her messages of love made my heart yearn to see her before she died and I mourned over the fact that it was impossible Some months after I returned from my flight to New England I received a letter from her in which she wrote Dr Flint is dead He has left a distressed family Poor old man I hope he made his peace with God I remembered how he had defrauded my grandmother of the hard earnings she had loaned how he had tried to cheat her out of the freedom her mistress had promised her and how he had persecuted her children and I thought to myself that she was a better Christian than I was if she could entirely forgive him I cannot say with truth that the news of my old master's death softened my feelings towards him There are wrongs which even the grave does not bury The man was odious to me while he lived and his memory is odious now His departure from this world did not diminish my danger He had threatened my grandmother that his heirs should hold me in slavery after he was gone that I never should be free so long as a child of his survived As for Mrs Flint I had seen her in deeper afflictions than I supposed the loss of her husband would be for she had buried several children yet I never saw any signs of softening in her heart The doctor had died in embarrassed circumstances and had little to will to his heirs except such property as he was unable to grasp I was well aware what I had to expect from the family of Flints and my fears were confirmed by a letter from the south warning me to be on my guard because Mrs Flint openly declared that her daughter could not afford to lose so valuable a slave as I was I kept close watch of the newspapers for arrivals but one Saturday night being much occupied I forgot to examine the Evening Express as usual I went down into the parlor for it early in the morning and found the boy about to kindle a fire with it I took it from him and examined the list of arrivals Reader if you have never been a slave you cannot imagine the acute sensation of suffering at my heart when I read the names of Mr and Mrs Dodge at a hotel in Courtland Street It was a third-rate hotel and that circumstance convinced me of the truth of what I had heard that they were short of funds and had need of my value as they valued me and that was by dollars and cents I hastened with the paper to Mrs Bruce Her heart and hand were always open to every one in distress and she always warmly sympathized with mine It was impossible to tell how near the enemy was He might have passed and repassed the house while we were sleeping He might at that moment be waiting to pounce upon me if I ventured out of doors I had never seen the husband of my young mistress and therefore I could not distinguish him from any other stranger A carriage was hastily ordered and closely veiled I followed Mrs Bruce taking the baby again with me into exile After various turnings and crossings and returnings the carriage stopped at the house of one of Mrs Bruce's friends where I was kindly received Mrs Bruce returned immediately to instruct the domestics what to say if any one came to inquire for me It was lucky for me that the evening paper was not burned up before I had a chance to examine the list of arrivals It was not long after Mrs Bruce's return to her house before several people came to inquire for me One inquired for me another asked for my daughter Ellen and another said he had a letter from my grandmother which he was requested to deliver in person They were told She has lived here but she has left How long ago I don't know sir Do you know where she went I do not sir And the door was closed This Mr Dodge who claimed me as his property was originally a Yankee pedler in the south then he became a merchant and finally a slaveholder He managed to get introduced into what was called the first society and married Miss Emily Flint A quarrel arose between him and her brother and the brother cowhided him This led to a family feud and he proposed to remove to Virginia Dr Flint left him no property and his own means had become circumscribed while a wife and children depended upon him for support Under these circumstances it was very natural that he should make an effort to put me into his pocket I had a colored friend a man from my native place in whom I had the most implicit confidence I sent for him and told him that Mr and Mrs Dodge had arrived in New York I proposed that he should call upon them to make inquiries about his friends at the south with whom Dr Flint's family were well acquainted He thought there was no impropriety in his doing so and he consented He went to the hotel and knocked at the door of Mr Dodge's room which was opened by the gentleman himself who gruffly inquired What brought you here How came you to know I was in the city Your arrival was published in the evening papers sir and I called to ask Mrs Dodge about my friends at home I didn't suppose it would give any offence Where's that negro girl that belongs to my wife What girl sir You know well enough I mean Linda that ran away from Dr Flint's plantation some years ago I dare say you've seen her and know where she is Yes sir I've seen her and know where she is She is out of your reach sir Tell me where she is or bring her to me and I will give her a chance to buy her freedom I don't think it would be of any use sir I have heard her say she would go to the ends of the earth rather than pay any man or woman for her freedom because she thinks she has a right to it Besides she couldn't do it if she would for she has spent her earnings to educate her children This made Mr Dodge very angry and some high words passed between them My friend was afraid to come where I was but in the course of the day I received a note from him I supposed they had not come from the south in the winter for a pleasure excursion and now the nature of their business was very plain Mrs Bruce came to me and entreated me to leave the city the next morning She said her house was watched and it was possible that some clew to me might be obtained I refused to take her advice She pleaded with an earnest tenderness that ought to have moved me but I was in a bitter disheartened mood I was weary of flying from pillar to post I had been chased during half my life and it seemed as if the chase was never to end There I sat in that great city guiltless of crime yet not daring to worship God in any of the churches I heard the bells ringing for afternoon service and with contemptuous sarcasm I said Will the preachers take for their text 'Proclaim liberty to the captive and the opening of prison doors to them that are bound' or will they preach from the text 'Do unto others as ye would they should do unto you' Oppressed Poles and Hungarians could find a safe refuge in that city John Mitchell was free to proclaim in the City Hall his desire for a plantation well stocked with slaves but there I sat an oppressed American not daring to show my face God forgive the black and bitter thoughts I indulged on that Sabbath day The Scripture says Oppression makes even a wise man mad and I was not wise I had been told that Mr Dodge said his wife had never signed away her right to my children and if he could not get me he would take them This it was more than any thing else that roused such a tempest in my soul Benjamin was with his uncle William in California but my innocent young daughter had come to spend a vacation with me I thought of what I had suffered in slavery at her age and my heart was like a tiger's when a hunter tries to seize her young Dear Mrs Bruce I seem to see the expression of her face as she turned away discouraged by my obstinate mood Finding her expostulations unavailing she sent Ellen to entreat me When ten o'clock in the evening arrived and Ellen had not returned this watchful and unwearied friend became anxious She came to us in a carriage bringing a well-filled trunk for my journeytrusting that by this time I would listen to reason I yielded to her as I ought to have done before The next day baby and I set out in a heavy snow storm bound for New England again I received letters from the City of Iniquity addressed to me under an assumed name In a few days one came from Mrs Bruce informing me that my new master was still searching for me and that she intended to put an end to this persecution by buying my freedom I felt grateful for the kindness that prompted this offer but the idea was not so pleasant to me as might have been expected The more my mind had become enlightened the more difficult it was for me to consider myself an article of property and to pay money to those who had so grievously oppressed me seemed like taking from my sufferings the glory of triumph I wrote to Mrs Bruce thanking her but saying that being sold from one owner to another seemed too much like slavery that such a great obligation could not be easily cancelled and that I preferred to go to my brother in California Without my knowledge Mrs Bruce employed a gentleman in New York to enter into negotiations with Mr Dodge He proposed to pay three hundred dollars down if Mr Dodge would sell me and enter into obligations to relinquish all claim to me or my children forever after He who called himself my master said he scorned so small an offer for such a valuable servant The gentleman replied You can do as you choose sir If you reject this offer you will never get any thing for the woman has friends who will convey her and her children out of the country Mr Dodge concluded that half a loaf was better than no bread and he agreed to the proffered terms By the next mail I received this brief letter from Mrs Bruce I am rejoiced to tell you that the money for your freedom has been paid to Mr Dodge Come home to-morrow I long to see you and my sweet babe My brain reeled as I read these lines A gentleman near me said It's true I have seen the bill of sale The bill of sale Those words struck me like a blow So I was sold at last A human being sold in the free city of New York The bill of sale is on record and future generations will learn from it that women were articles of traffic in New York late in the nineteenth century of the Christian religion It may hereafter prove a useful document to antiquaries who are seeking to measure the progress of civilization in the United States I well know the value of that bit of paper but much as I love freedom I do not like to look upon it I am deeply grateful to the generous friend who procured it but I despise the miscreant who demanded payment for what never rightfully belonged to him or his I had objected to having my freedom bought yet I must confess that when it was done I felt as if a heavy load had been lifted from my weary shoulders When I rode home in the cars I was no longer afraid to unveil my face and look at people as they passed I should have been glad to have met Daniel Dodge himself to have had him seen me and known me that he might have mourned over the untoward circumstances which compelled him to sell me for three hundred dollars When I reached home the arms of my benefactress were thrown round me and our tears mingled As soon as she could speak she said O Linda I'm so glad it's all over You wrote to me as if you thought you were going to be transferred from one owner to another But I did not buy you for your services I should have done just the same if you had been going to sail for California to-morrow I should at least have the satisfaction of knowing that you left me a free woman My heart was exceedingly full I remembered how my poor father had tried to buy me when I was a small child and how he had been disappointed I hoped his spirit was rejoicing over me now I remembered how my good old grandmother had laid up her earnings to purchase me in later years and how often her plans had been frustrated How that faithful loving old heart would leap for joy if she could look on me and my children now that we were free My relatives had been foiled in all their efforts but God had raised me up a friend among strangers who had bestowed on me the precious long-desired boon Friend It is a common word often lightly used Like other good and beautiful things it may be tarnished by careless handling but when I speak of Mrs Bruce as my friend the word is sacred My grandmother lived to rejoice in my freedom but not long after a letter came with a black seal She had gone where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest Time passed on and a paper came to me from the south containing an obituary notice of my uncle Phillip It was the only case I ever knew of such an honor conferred upon a colored person It was written by one of his friends and contained these words Now that death has laid him low they call him a good man and a useful citizen but what are eulogies to the black man when the world has faded from his vision It does not require man's praise to obtain rest in God's kingdom So they called a colored man a citizen Strange words to be uttered in that region Reader my story ends with freedom not in the usual way with marriage I and my children are now free We are as free from the power of slaveholders as are the white people of the north and though that according to my ideas is not saying a great deal it is a vast improvement in my condition The dream of my life is not yet realized I do not sit with my children in a home of my own I still long for a hearthstone of my own however humble I wish it for my children's sake far more than for my own But God so orders circumstances as to keep me with my friend Mrs Bruce Love duty gratitude also bind me to her side It is a privilege to serve her who pities my oppressed people and who has bestowed the inestimable boon of freedom on me and my children It has been painful to me in many ways to recall the dreary years I passed in bondage I would gladly forget them if I could Yet the retrospection is not altogether without solace for with those gloomy recollections come tender memories of my good old grandmother like light fleecy clouds floating over a dark and troubled sea APPENDIX THE following statement is from Amy Post a member of the Society of Friends in the State of New York well known and highly respected by friends of the poor and the oppressed As has been already stated in the preceding s the author of this volume spent some time under her hospitable roof L M C The author of this book is my highly-esteemed friend If its readers knew her as I know her they could not fail to be deeply interested in her story She was a beloved inmate of our family nearly the whole of the year She was introduced to us by her affectionate and conscientious brother who had previously related to us some of the almost incredible events in his sister's life I immediately became much interested in Linda for her appearance was prepossessing and her deportment indicated remarkable delicacy of feeling and purity of thought As we became acquainted she related to me from time to time some of the incidents in her bitter experiences as a slave-woman Though impelled by a natural craving for human sympathy she passed through a baptism of suffering even in recounting her trials to me in private confidential conversations The burden of these memories lay heavily upon her spiritnaturally virtuous and refined I repeatedly urged her to consent to the publication of her narrative for I felt that it would arouse people to a more earnest work for the disinthralment of millions still remaining in that soul-crushing condition which was so unendurable to her But her sensitive spirit shrank from publicity She said 'You know a woman can whisper her cruel wrongs in the ear of a dear friend much easier than she can record them for the world to read' Even in talking with me she wept so much and seemed to suffer such mental agony that I felt her story was too sacred to be drawn from her by inquisitive questions and I left her free to tell as much or as little as she chose Still I urged upon her the duty of publishing her experience for the sake of the good it might do and at last she undertook the task Having been a slave so large a portion of her life she is unlearned she is obliged to earn her living by her own labor and she has worked untiringly to procure education for her children several times she has been obliged to leave her employments in order to fly from the man-hunters and woman-hunters of our land but she pressed through all these obstacles and overcame them After the labors of the day were over she traced secretly and wearily by the midnight lamp a truthful record of her eventful life This Empire State is a shabby place of refuge for the oppressed but here through anxiety turmoil and despair the freedom of Linda and her children was finally secured by the exertions of a generous friend She was grateful for the boon but the idea of having been bought was always galling to a spirit that could never acknowledge itself to be a chattel She wrote to us thus soon after the event 'I thank you for your kind expressions in regard to my freedom but the freedom I had before the money was paid was dearer to me God gave me that freedom but man put God's image in the scales with the paltry sum of three hundred dollars I served for my liberty as faithfully as Jacob served for Rachel At the end he had large possessions but I was robbed of my victory I was obliged to resign my crown to rid myself of a tyrant' Her story as written by herself cannot fail to interest the reader It is a sad illustration of the condition of this country which boasts of its civilization while it sanctions laws and customs which make the experiences of the present more strange than any fictions of the past AMY POST ROCHESTER N Y Oct th The following is from a man who is now a highly respectable colored citizen of Boston LMC This narrative contains some incidents so extraordinary that doubtless many persons under whose eyes it may chance to fall will be ready to believe that it is colored highly to serve a special purpose But however it may be regarded by the incredulous I know that it is full of living truths I have been well acquainted with the author from my boyhood The circumstances recounted in her history are perfectly familiar to me I knew of her treatment from her master of the imprisonment of her children of their sale and redemption of her seven years' concealment and of her subsequent escape to the North I am now a resident of Boston and am a living witness to the truth of this interesting narrative GEORGE W LOWTHER

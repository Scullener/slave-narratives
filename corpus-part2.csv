Mary-Prince,THE HISTORY OF MARY PRINCE A WEST INDIAN SLAVE RELATED BY HERSELF WITH A SUPPLEMENT BY THE EDITOR To which is added THE NARRATIVE OF ASA ASA A CAPTURED AFRICAN By our sufferings since ye brought us To the man degrading mart All sustain'd by patience taught us Only by a broken heart Deem our nation brutes no longer Till some reason ye shall find Worthier of regard and stronger Than the colour of our kind COWPER THIRD EDITION LONDON PUBLISHED BY F WESTLEY AND A H DAVIS STATIONERS' HALL COURT AND BY WAUGH INNES EDINBURGH And supplied at trade price to Anti Slavery Associations by JOSEPH PHILLIPS Aldermanbury Page i PREFACE THE idea of writing Mary Prince's history was first suggested by herself She wished it to be done she said that good people in England might hear from a slave what a slave had felt and suffered and a letter of her late master's which will be found in the Supplement induced me to accede to her wish without farther delay The more immediate object of the publication will afterwards appear The narrative was taken down from Mary's own lips by a lady who happened to be at the time residing in my family as a visitor It was written out fully with all the narrator's repetitions and prolixities and afterwards pruned into its present shape retaining as far as was practicable Mary's exact expressions and peculiar phraseology No fact of importance has been omitted and not a single circumstance or sentiment has been added It is essentially her own without any material alteration farther than was requisite to exclude redundances and gross grammatical errors so as to render it clearly intelligible After it had been thus written out I went over the whole carefully examining her on every fact and circumstance detailed and in all that relates to her residence in Antigua I had the advantage of being assisted in this scrutiny by Mr Joseph Phillips who was a resident in that colony during the same period and had known her there The names of all the persons mentioned by the narrator have been printed in full except those of Capt I and his wife and that of Mr D to whom conduct of peculiar atrocity is ascribed These three individuals are now gone to answer at a far more awful tribunal than that of public opinion for the deeds of which their former bondwoman accuses them and to hold them up more openly to human reprobation could no longer affect themselves while it might deeply lacerate the feelings of their surviving and perhaps innocent relatives without any commensurate public advantage Page ii Without detaining the reader with remarks on other points which will be adverted to more conveniently in the Supplement I shall here merely notice farther that the Anti Slavery Society have no concern whatever with this publication nor are they in any degree responsible for the statements it contains I have published the tract not as their Secretary but in my private capacity and any profits that may arise from the sale will be exclusively appropriated to the benefit of Mary Prince herself While Mary's history was in the press I was furnished by my friend Mr George Stephen with the interesting narrative of Asa Asa a captured African now under his protection and have printed it as a suitable appendix THO PRINGLE London January POSTSCRIPT SECOND EDITION Since the First Edition of this Tract was published Mary Prince has been afflicted with a disease in the eyes which it is feared may terminate in total blindness such at least is the apprehension of some skilful medical gentlemen who have been consulted on the case Should this unfortunately be the result the condition of the poor negro woman thus cruelly and hopelessly severed from her husband and her home will be one peculiarly deserving of commiseration and I mention the circumstance at present on purpose to induce the friends of humanity to promote the more zealously the sale of this publication with a view to provide a little fund for her future benefit Whatever be the subsequent lot that Providence may have in reserve for her the seasonable sympathy thus manifested in her behalf will neither be fruitlessly extended nor unthankfully received while in accordance with the benign scripture mandate it will serve to mitigate and relieve as far as human kindness can the afflictions of the stranger and the exile who is in our and within our gates The present Cheap Edition price s for single copies and d each if or more are ordered is printed expressly to facilitate the circulation of this Tract by Anti slavery Societies T P March Page THE HISTORY OF MARY PRINCE A WEST INDIAN SLAVE Related by herself I WAS born at Brackish Pond in Bermuda on a farm belonging to Mr Charles Myners My mother was a household slave and my father whose name was Prince was a sawyer belonging to Mr Trimmingham a ship builder at Crow Lane When I was an infant old Mr Myners died and there was a division of the slaves and other property among the family I was bought along with my mother by old Captain Darrel and given to his grandchild little Miss Betsey Williams Captain Williams Mr Darrel's son in law was master of a vessel which traded to several places in America and the West Indies and he was seldom at home long together Mrs Williams was a kind hearted good woman and she treated all her slaves well She had only one daughter Miss Betsey for whom I was purchased and who was about my own age I was made quite a pet of by Miss Betsey and loved her very much She used to lead me about by the hand and call me her little nigger This was the happiest period of my life for I was too young to understand rightly my condition as a slave and too thoughtless and full of spirits to look forward to the days of toil and sorrow My mother was a household slave in the same family I was under her own care and my little brothers and sisters were my play fellows and companions My mother had several fine children after she came to Mrs Williams three girls and two boys The tasks given out to us children were light and we used to play together with Miss Betsey with as much freedom almost as if she had been our sister My master however was a very harsh selfish man and we always dreaded his return from sea His wife was herself much afraid of him and during his stay at home seldom dared to shew her usual kindness to the slaves He often left her in the most distressed circumstances to reside in other female society at some place in the West Indies of which I have forgot the name My poor mistress bore his ill treatment with great patience and all her slaves loved and pitied her I was truly attached to her and next to my own mother loved her better than any creature in the world My obedience to her commands was cheerfully Page given it sprung solely from the affection I felt for her and not from fear of the power which the white people's law had given her over me I had scarcely reached my twelfth year when my mistress became too poor to keep so many of us at home and she hired me out to Mrs Pruden a lady who lived about five miles off in the adjoining parish in a large house near the sea I cried bitterly at parting with my dear mistress and Miss Betsey and when I kissed my mother and brothers and sisters I thought my young heart would break it pained me so But there was no help I was forced to go Good Mrs Williams comforted me by saying that I should still be near the home I was about to quit and might come over and see her and my kindred whenever I could obtain leave of absence from Mrs Pruden A few hours after this I was taken to a strange house and found myself among strange people This separation seemed a sore trial to me then but oh 'twas light light to the trials I have since endured 'twas nothing nothing to be mentioned with them but I was a child then and it was according to my strength I knew that Mrs Williams could no longer maintain me that she was fain to part with me for my food and clothing and I tried to submit myself to the change My new mistress was a passionate woman but yet she did not treat me very unkindly I do not remember her striking me but once and that was for going to see Mrs Williams when I heard she was sick and staying longer than she had given me leave to do All my employment at this time was nursing a sweet baby little Master Daniel and I grew so fond of my nursling that it was my greatest delight to walk out with him by the sea shore accompanied by his brother and sister Miss Fanny and Master James Dear Miss Fanny She was a sweet kind young lady and so fond of me that she wished me to learn all that she knew herself and her method of teaching me was as follows Directly she had said her lessons to her grandmamma she used to come running to me and make me repeat them one by one after her and in a few months I was able not only to say my letters but to spell many small words But this happy state was not to last long Those days were too pleasant to last My heart always softens when I think of them At this time Mrs Williams died I was told suddenly of her death and my grief was so great that forgetting I had the baby in my arms I ran away directly to my poor mistress's house but reached it only in time to see the corpse carried out Oh that was a day of sorrow a heavy day All the slaves cried My mother cried and lamented her sore and I foolish creature vainly entreated them to bring my dear mistress back to life I knew nothing rightly about death then and it seemed a hard thing to bear When I thought about my mistress I felt as if the world was all gone wrong and for many days and weeks I could think of nothing else I returned to Mrs Pruden's but my sorrow was too great to be comforted for my own dear mistress was always in my mind Whether in the house or abroad my thoughts were always talking to me about her I staid at Mrs Pruden's about three months after this I was Page then sent back to Mr Williams to be sold Oh that was a sad sad time I recollect the day well Mrs Pruden came to me and said Mary you will have to go home directly your master is going to be married and he means to sell you and two of your sisters to raise money for the wedding Hearing this I burst out a crying though I was then far from being sensible of the full weight of my misfortune or of the misery that waited for me Besides I did not like to leave Mrs Pruden and the dear baby who had grown very fond of me For some time I could scarcely believe that Mrs Pruden was in earnest till I received orders for my immediate return Dear Miss Fanny how she cried at parting with me whilst I kissed and hugged the baby thinking I should never see him again I left Mrs Pruden's and walked home with a heart full of sorrow The idea of being sold away from my mother and Miss Betsey was so frightful that I dared not trust myself to think about it We had been bought of Mr Myners as I have mentioned by Miss Betsey's grandfather and given to her so that we were by right her property and I never thought we should be separated or sold away from her When I reached the house I went in directly to Miss Betsey I found her in great distress and she cried out as soon as she saw me Oh Mary my father is going to sell you all to raise money to marry that wicked woman You are my slaves and he has no right to sell you but it is all to please her She then told me that my mother was living with her father's sister at a house close by and I went there to see her It was a sorrowful meeting and we lamented with a great and sore crying our unfortunate situation Here comes one of my poor picaninnies she said the moment I came in one of the poor slave brood who are to be sold to morrow Oh dear I cannot bear to think of that day it is too much It recalls the great grief that filled my heart and the woeful thoughts that passed to and fro through my mind whilst listening to the pitiful words of my poor mother weeping for the loss of her children I wish I could find words to tell you all I then felt and suffered The great God above alone knows the thoughts of the poor slave's heart and the bitter pains which follow such separations as these All that we love taken away from us Oh it is sad sad and sore to be borne I got no sleep that night for thinking of the morrow and dear Miss Betsey was scarcely less distressed She could not bear to part with her old playmates and she cried sore and would not be pacified The black morning at length came it came too soon for my poor mother and us Whilst she was putting on us the new osnaburgs in which we were to be sold she said in a sorrowful voice I shall never forget it See I am shrouding my poor children what a task for a mother She then called Miss Betsey to take leave of us I am going to carry my little chickens to market these were her very words take your last look of them may be you will see them no more Oh my poor slaves my own slaves said dear Miss Betsey you belong to me and it grieves my heart to part with you Miss Betsey kissed us all and when she left us my mother called the rest of the slaves to bid us good bye One of them a woman named Moll Page came with her infant in her arms Ay said my mother seeing her turn away and look at her child with the tears in her eyes your turn will come next The slaves could say nothing to comfort us they could only weep and lament with us When I left my dear little brothers and the house in which I had been brought up I thought my heart would burst Our mother weeping as she went called me away with the children Hannah and Dinah and we took the road that led to Hamble Town which we reached about four o'clock in the afternoon We followed my mother to the market place where she placed us in a row against a large house with our backs to the wall and our arms folded across our breasts I as the eldest stood first Hannah next to me then Dinah and our mother stood beside crying over us My heart throbbed with grief and terror so violently that I pressed my hands quite tightly across my breast but I could not keep it still and it continued to leap as though it would burst out of my body But who cared for that Did one of the many by standers who were looking at us so carelessly think of the pain that wrung the hearts of the negro woman and her young ones No no They were not all bad I dare say but slavery hardens white people's hearts towards the blacks and many of them were not slow to make their remarks upon us aloud without regard to our grief though their light words fell like cayenne on the fresh wounds of our hearts Oh those white people have small hearts who can only feel for themselves At length the vendue master who was to offer us for sale like sheep or cattle arrived and asked my mother which was the eldest She said nothing but pointed to me He took me by the hand and led me out into the middle of the street and turning me slowly round exposed me to the view of those who attended the vendue I was soon surrounded by strange men who examined and handled me in the same manner that a butcher would a calf or a lamb he was about to purchase and who talked about my shape and size in like words as if I could no more understand their meaning than the dumb beasts I was then put up to sale The bidding commenced at a few pounds and gradually rose to fifty seven Bermuda currency about sterling when I was knocked down to the highest bidder and the people who stood by said that I had fetched a great sum for so young a slave I then saw my sisters led forth and sold to different owners so that we had not the sad satisfaction of being partners in bondage When the sale was over my mother hugged and kissed us and mourned over us begging of us to keep up a good heart and do our duty to our new masters It was a sad parting one went one way one another and our poor mammy went home with nothing Let the reader compare the above affecting account taken down from the mouth of this negro woman with the following description of a vendue of slaves at the Cape of Good Hope published by me in from the letter of a friend and mark their similarity in several characteristic circumstances The resemblance is easily accounted for slavery wherever it prevails produces similar effects Having heard that there was to be a sale of cattle farm stock c by auction at a Veld Cornet's in the vicinity we halted our waggon one day for the purpose of procuring a fresh spann of oxen Among the stock of the farm sold was a female slave and her three children The two eldest children were girls the one about thirteen years of age and the other about eleven the youngest was a boy The whole family were exhibited together but they were sold separately and to different purchasers The farmers examined them as if they had been so many head of cattle While the sale was going on the mother and her children were exhibited on a table that they might be seen by the company which was very large There could not have been a finer subject for an able painter than this unhappy group The tears the anxiety the anguish of the mother while she met the gaze of the multitude eyed the different countenances of the bidders or cast a heart rending look upon the children and the simplicity and touching sorrow of the young ones while they clung to their distracted parent wiping their eyes and half concealing their faces contrasted with the marked insensibility and jocular countenances of the spectators and purchasers furnished a striking commentary on the miseries of slavery and its debasing effects upon the hearts of its abettors While the woman was in this distressed situation she was asked 'Can you feed sheep ' Her reply was so indistinct that it escaped me but it was probably in the negative for her purchaser rejoined in a loud and harsh voice 'Then I will teach you with the sjamboc ' a whip made of the rhinoceros' hide The mother and her three children were sold to three separate purchasers and they were literally torn from each other Ed Page My new master was a Captain I who lived at Spanish Point After parting with my mother and sisters I followed him to his store and he gave me into the charge of his son a lad about my own age Master Benjy who took me to my new home I did not know where I was going or what my new master would do with me My heart was quite broken with grief and my thoughts went back continually to those from whom I had been so suddenly parted Oh my mother my mother I kept saying to myself Oh my mammy and my sisters and my brothers shall I never see you again Oh the trials the trials they make the salt water come into my eyes when I think of the days in which I was afflicted the times that are gone when I mourned and grieved with a young heart for those whom I loved It was night when I reached my new home The house was large and built at the bottom of a very high hill but I could not see much of it that night I saw too much of it afterwards The stones and the timber were the best things in it they were not so hard as the hearts of the owners These strong expressions and all of a similar character in this little narrative are given verbatim as uttered by Mary Prince Ed Before I entered the house two slave women hired from another owner who were at work in the yard spoke to me and asked who I belonged to I replied I am come to live here Poor child poor child they both said you must keep a good heart if you are to live here When I went in I stood up crying in a corner Mrs I came and took off my hat a little black silk hat Miss Pruden made for me and said in a rough voice You are not come here to stand up in corners and cry you are come here to work She then put a child into my arms and tired as I was I was forced instantly to Page take up my old occupation of a nurse I could not bear to look at my mistress her countenance was so stern She was a stout tall woman with a very dark complexion and her brows were always drawn together into a frown I thought of the words of the two slave women when I saw Mrs I and heard the harsh sound of her voice The person I took the most notice of that night was a French Black called Hetty whom my master took in privateering from another vessel and made his slave She was the most active woman I ever saw and she was tasked to her utmost A few minutes after my arrival she came in from milking the cows and put the sweet potatoes on for supper She then fetched home the sheep and penned them in the fold drove home the cattle and staked them about the pond side The cattle on a small plantation in Bermuda are it seems often thus staked tethered both night and day in situations where grass abounds fed and rubbed down my master's horse and gave the hog and the fed cow A cow fed for slaughter their suppers prepared the beds and undressed the children and laid them to sleep I liked to look at her and watch all her doings for her's was the only friendly face I had as yet seen and I felt glad that she was there She gave me my supper of potatoes and milk and a blanket to sleep upon which she spread for me in the passage before the door of Mrs I 's chamber I got a sad fright that night I was just going to sleep when I heard a noise in my mistress's room and she presently called out to enquire if some work was finished that she had ordered Hetty to do No Ma'am not yet was Hetty's answer from below On hearing this my master started up from his bed and just as he was in his shirt ran down stairs with a long cow skin A thong of hard twisted hide known by this name in the West Indies in his hand I heard immediately after the cracking of the thong and the house rang to the shrieks of poor Hetty who kept crying out Oh Massa Massa dead Massa have mercy upon me don't kill me outright This was a sad beginning for me I sat up upon my blanket trembling with terror like a frightened hound and thinking that my turn would come next At length the house became still and I forgot for a little while all my sorrows by falling fast asleep The next morning my mistress set about instructing me in my tasks She taught me to do all sorts of household work to wash and bake pick cotton and wool and wash floors and cook And she taught me how can I ever forget it more things than these she caused me to know the exact difference between the smart of the rope the cart whip and the cow skin when applied to my naked body by her own cruel hand And there was scarcely any punishment more dreadful than the blows received on my face and head from her hard heavy fist She was a fearful woman and a savage mistress to her slaves There were two little slave boys in the house on whom she vented her bad temper in a special manner One of these children was a mulatto called Cyrus who had been bought while an infant in his mother's arms the other Jack was an African from the coast of Guinea whom a sailor had given or sold to my master Seldom a day passed without Page these boys receiving the most severe treatment and often for no fault at all Both my master and mistress seemed to think that they had a right to ill use them at their pleasure and very often accompanied their commands with blows whether the children were behaving well or ill I have seen their flesh ragged and raw with licks Lick lick they were never secure one moment from a blow and their lives were passed in continual fear My mistress was not contented with using the whip but often pinched their cheeks and arms in the most cruel manner My pity for these poor boys was soon transferred to myself for I was licked and flogged and pinched by her pitiless fingers in the neck and arms exactly as they were To strip me naked to hang me up by the wrists and lay my flesh open with the cow skin was an ordinary punishment for even a slight offence My mistress often robbed me too of the hours that belong to sleep She used to sit up very late frequently even until morning and I had then to stand at a bench and wash during the greater part of the night or pick wool and cotton and often I have dropped down overcome by sleep and fatigue till roused from a state of stupor by the whip and forced to start up to my tasks Poor Hetty my fellow slave was very kind to me and I used to call her my Aunt but she led a most miserable life and her death was hastened at least the slaves all believed and said so by the dreadful chastisement she received from my master during her pregnancy It happened as follows One of the cows had dragged the rope away from the stake to which Hetty had fastened it and got loose My master flew into a terrible passion and ordered the poor creature to be stripped quite naked notwithstanding her pregnancy and to be tied up to a tree in the yard He then flogged her as hard as he could lick both with the whip and cow skin till she was all over streaming with blood He rested and then beat her again and again Her shrieks were terrible The consequence was that poor Hetty was brought to bed before her time and was delivered after severe labour of a dead child She appeared to recover after her confinement so far that she was repeatedly flogged by both master and mistress afterwards but her former strength never returned to her Ere long her body and limbs swelled to a great size and she lay on a mat in the kitchen till the water burst out of her body and she died All the slaves said that death was a good thing for poor Hetty but I cried very much for her death The manner of it filled me with horror I could not bear to think about it yet it was always present to my mind for many a day After Hetty died all her labours fell upon me in addition to my own I had now to milk eleven cows every morning before sunrise sitting among the damp weeds to take care of the cattle as well as the children and to do the work of the house There was no end to my toils no end to my blows I lay down at night and rose up in the morning in fear and sorrow and often wished that like poor Hetty I could escape from this cruel bondage and be at rest in the grave But the hand of that God whom then I knew not was stretched over me and I was mercifully preserved for better things It was then however my heavy lot to weep weep weep and that for years to pass from one Page misery to another and from one cruel master to a worse But I must go on with the thread of my story One day a heavy squall of wind and rain came on suddenly and my mistress sent me round the corner of the house to empty a large earthen jar The jar was already cracked with an old deep crack that divided it in the middle and in turning it upside down to empty it it parted in my hand I could not help the accident but I was dreadfully frightened looking forward to a severe punishment I ran crying to my mistress O mistress the jar has come in two You have broken it have you she replied come directly here to me I came trembling she stripped and flogged me long and severely with the cow skin as long as she had strength to use the lash for she did not give over till she was quite tired When my master came home at night she told him of my fault and oh frightful how he fell a swearing After abusing me with every ill name he could think of too too bad to speak in England and giving me several heavy blows with his hand he said I shall come home to morrow morning at twelve on purpose to give you a round hundred He kept his word Oh sad for me I cannot easily forget it He tied me up upon a ladder and gave me a hundred lashes with his own hand and master Benjy stood by to count them for him When he had licked me for some time he sat down to take breath then after resting he beat me again and again until he was quite wearied and so hot for the weather was very sultry that he sank back in his chair almost like to faint While my mistress went to bring him drink there was a dreadful earthquake Part of the roof fell down and every thing in the house went clatter clatter clatter Oh I thought the end of all things near at hand and I was so sore with the flogging that I scarcely cared whether I lived or died The earth was groaning and shaking every thing tumbling about and my mistress and the slaves were shrieking and crying out The earthquake the earthquake It was an awful day for us all During the confusion I crawled away on my hands and knees and laid myself down under the steps of the piazza in front of the house I was in a dreadful state my body all blood and bruises and I could not help moaning piteously The other slaves when they saw me shook their heads and said Poor child poor child I lay there till the morning careless of what might happen for life was very weak in me and I wished more than ever to die But when we are very young death always seems a great way off and it would not come that night to me The next morning I was forced by my master to rise and go about my usual work though my body and limbs were so stiff and sore that I could not move without the greatest pain Nevertheless even after all this severe punishment I never heard the last of that jar my mistress was always throwing it in my face Some little time after this one of the cows got loose from the stake and eat one of the sweet potatoe slips I was milking when my master found it out He came to me and without any more ado stooped down and taking off his heavy boot he struck me such a severe blow in the small of my back that I shrieked with agony and thought I was killed and I feel a weakness in that part to this day The cow was Page frightened at his violence and kicked down the pail and spilt the milk all about My master knew that this accident was his own fault but he was so enraged that he seemed glad of an excuse to go on with his ill usage I cannot remember how many licks he gave me then but he beat me till I was unable to stand and till he himself was weary After this I ran away and went to my mother who was living with Mr Richard Darrel My poor mother was both grieved and glad to see me grieved because I had been so ill used and glad because she had not seen me for a long long while She dared not receive me into the house but she hid me up in a hole in the rocks near and brought me food at night after every body was asleep My father who lived at Crow Lane over the salt water channel at last heard of my being hid up in the cavern and he came and took me back to my master Oh I was loth loth to go back but as there was no remedy I was obliged to submit When we got home my poor father said to Capt I Sir I am sorry that my child should be forced to run away from her owner but the treatment she has received is enough to break her heart The sight of her wounds has nearly broke mine I entreat you for the love of God to forgive her for running away and that you will be a kind master to her in future Capt I said I was used as well as I deserved and that I ought to be punished for running away I then took courage and said that I could stand the floggings no longer that I was weary of my life and therefore I had run away to my mother but mothers could only weep and mourn over their children they could not save them from cruel masters from the whip the rope and the cowskin He told me to hold my tongue and go about my work or he would find a way to settle me He did not however flog me that day For five years after this I remained in his house and almost daily received the same harsh treatment At length he put me on board a sloop and to my great joy sent me away to Turk's Island I was not permitted to see my mother or father or poor sisters and brothers to say good bye though going away to a strange land and might never see them again Oh the Buckra people who keep slaves think that black people are like cattle without natural affection But my heart tells me it is far otherwise We were nearly four weeks on the voyage which was unusually long Sometimes we had a light breeze sometimes a great calm and the ship made no way so that our provisions and water ran very low and we were put upon short allowance I should almost have been starved had it not been for the kindness of a black man called Anthony and his wife who had brought their own victuals and shared them with me When we went ashore at the Grand Quay the captain sent me to the house of my new master Mr D to whom Captain I had sold me Grand Quay is a small town upon a sandbank the houses low and built of wood Such was my new master's The first person I saw on my arrival was Mr D a stout sulky looking man who carried me through the hall to show me to his wife and children Next day I was put up by the vendue master to know how much I was worth and I was valued at one hundred pounds currency Page My new master was one of the owners or holders of the salt ponds and he received a certain sum for every slave that worked upon his premises whether they were young or old This sum was allowed him out of the profits arising from the salt works I was immediately sent to work in the salt water with the rest of the slaves This work was perfectly new to me I was given a half barrel and a shovel and had to stand up to my knees in the water from four o'clock in the morning till nine when we were given some Indian corn boiled in water which we were obliged to swallow as fast as we could for fear the rain should come on and melt the salt We were then called again to our tasks and worked through the heat of the day the sun flaming upon our heads like fire and raising salt blisters in those parts which were not completely covered Our feet and legs from standing in the salt water for so many hours soon became full of dreadful boils which eat down in some cases to the very bone afflicting the sufferers with great torment We came home at twelve ate our corn soup called blawly as fast as we could and went back to our employment till dark at night We then shovelled up the salt in large heaps and went down to the sea where we washed the pickle from our limbs and cleaned the barrows and shovels from the salt When we returned to the house our master gave us each our allowance of raw Indian corn which we pounded in a mortar and boiled in water for our suppers We slept in a long shed divided into narrow slips like the stalls used for cattle Boards fixed upon stakes driven into the ground without mat or covering were our only beds On Sundays after we had washed the salt bags and done other work required of us we went into the bush and cut the long soft grass of which we made trusses for our legs and feet to rest upon for they were so full of the salt boils that we could get no rest lying upon the bare boards Though we worked from morning till night there was no satisfying Mr D I hoped when I left Capt I that I should have been better off but I found it was but going from one butcher to another There was this difference between them my former master used to beat me while raging and foaming with passion Mr D was usually quite calm He would stand by and give orders for a slave to be cruelly whipped and assist in the punishment without moving a muscle of his face walking about and taking snuff with the greatest composure Nothing could touch his hard heart neither sighs nor tears nor prayers nor streaming blood he was deaf to our cries and careless of our sufferings Mr D has often stripped me naked hung me up by the wrists and beat me with the cow skin with his own hand till my body was raw with gashes Yet there was nothing very remarkable in this for it might serve as a sample of the common usage of the slaves on that horrible island Owing to the boils in my feet I was unable to wheel the barrow fast through the sand which got into the sores and made me stumble at every step and my master having no pity for my sufferings from this cause rendered them far more intolerable by chastising me for not being able to move so fast as he wished me Another of our employments was to row a little way off from the shore in a boat and dive Page for large stones to build a wall round our master's house This was very hard work and the great waves breaking over us continually made us often so giddy that we lost our footing and were in danger of being drowned Ah poor me my tasks were never ended Sick or well it was work work work After the diving season was over we were sent to the South Creek with large bills to cut up mangoes to burn lime with Whilst one party of slaves were thus employed another were sent to the other side of the island to break up coral out of the sea When we were ill let our complaint be what it might the only medicine given to us was a great bowl of hot salt water with salt mixed with it which made us very sick If we could not keep up with the rest of the gang of slaves we were put in the stocks and severely flogged the next morning Yet not the less our master expected after we had thus been kept from our rest and our limbs rendered stiff and sore with ill usage that we should still go through the ordinary tasks of the day all the same Sometimes we had to work all night measuring salt to load a vessel or turning a machine to draw water out of the sea for the salt making Then we had no sleep no rest but were forced to work as fast as we could and go on again all next day the same as usual Work work work Oh that Turk's Island was a horrible place The people in England I am sure have never found out what is carried on there Cruel horrible place Mr D had a slave called old Daniel whom he used to treat in the most cruel manner Poor Daniel was lame in the hip and could not keep up with the rest of the slaves and our master would order him to be stripped and laid down on the ground and have him beaten with a rod of rough briar till his skin was quite red and raw He would then call for a bucket of salt and fling upon the raw flesh till the man writhed on the ground like a worm and screamed aloud with agony This poor man's wounds were never healed and I have often seen them full of maggots which increased his torments to an intolerable degree He was an object of pity and terror to the whole gang of slaves and in his wretched case we saw each of us our own lot if we should live to be as old Oh the horrors of slavery How the thought of it pains my heart But the truth ought to be told of it and what my eyes have seen I think it is my duty to relate for few people in England know what slavery is I have been a slave I have felt what a slave feels and I know what a slave knows and I would have all the good people in England to know it too that they may break our chains and set us free Mr D had another slave called Ben He being very hungry stole a little rice one night after he came in from work and cooked it for his supper But his master soon discovered the theft locked him up all night and kept him without food till one o'clock the next day He then hung Ben up by his hands and beat him from time to time till the slaves came in at night We found the poor creature hung up when we came home with a pool of blood beneath him and our master still licking him But this was not the worst My master's son was in the habit of stealing the rice and rum Ben had seen him do this and thought he might do the same and when master found out that Ben Page had stolen the rice and swore to punish him he tried to excuse himself by saying that Master Dickey did the same thing every night The lad denied it to his father and was so angry with Ben for informing against him that out of revenge he ran and got a bayonet and whilst the poor wretch was suspended by his hands and writhing under his wounds he run it quite through his foot I was not by when he did it but I saw the wound when I came home and heard Ben tell the manner in which it was done I must say something more about this cruel son of a cruel father He had no heart no fear of God he had been brought up by a bad father in a bad path and he delighted to follow in the same steps There was a little old woman among the slaves called Sarah who was nearly past work and Master Dickey being the overseer of the slaves just then this poor creature who was subject to several bodily infirmities and was not quite right in her head did not wheel the barrow fast enough to please him He threw her down on the ground and after beating her severely he took her up in his arms and flung her among the prickly pear bushes which are all covered over with sharp venomous prickles By this her naked flesh was so grievously wounded that her body swelled and festered all over and she died a few days after In telling my own sorrows I cannot pass by those of my fellow slaves for when I think of my own griefs I remember theirs I think it was about ten years I had worked in the salt ponds at Turk's Island when my master left off business and retired to a house he had in Bermuda leaving his son to succeed him in the island He took me with him to wait upon his daughters and I was joyful for I was sick sick of Turk's Island and my heart yearned to see my native place again my mother and my kindred I had seen my poor mother during the time I was a slave in Turk's Island One Sunday morning I was on the beach with some of the slaves and we saw a sloop come in loaded with slaves to work in the salt water We got a boat and went aboard When I came upon the deck I asked the black people Is there any one here for me Yes they said your mother I thought they said this in jest I could scarcely believe them for joy but when I saw my poor mammy my joy was turned to sorrow for she had gone from her senses Mammy I said is this you She did not know me Mammy I said what's the matter She began to talk foolishly and said that she had been under the vessel's bottom They had been overtaken by a violent storm at sea My poor mother had never been on the sea before and she was so ill that she lost her senses and it was long before she came quite to herself again She had a sweet child with her a little sister I had never seen about four years of age called Rebecca I took her on shore with me for I felt I should love her directly and I kept her with me a week Poor little thing her's has been a sad life and continues so to this day My mother worked for some years on the island but was taken back to Bermuda some time before my master carried me again thither Of the subsequent lot of her relatives she can tell but little She says her father died while she and her mother were at Turk's Island and that he had been long dead and buried before any of his children in Bermuda knew of it they being slaves on other estates Her mother died after Mary went to Antigua Of the fate of the rest of her kindred seven brothers and three sisters she knows nothing further than this that the eldest sister who had several children to her master was taken by him to Trinidad and that the youngest Rebecca is still alive and in slavery in Bermuda Mary herself is now about forty three years of age Ed Page After I left Turk's Island I was told by some negroes that came over from it that the poor slaves had built up a place with boughs and leaves where they might meet for prayers but the white people pulled it down twice and would not allow them even a shed for prayers A flood came down soon after and washed away many houses filled the place with sand and overflowed the ponds and I do think that this was for their wickedness for the Buckra men Negro term for white people there were very wicked I saw and heard much that was very very bad at that place I was several years the slave of Mr D after I returned to my native place Here I worked in the grounds My work was planting and hoeing sweet potatoes Indian corn plaintains bananas cabbages pumpkins onions c I did all the household work and attended upon a horse and cow besides going also upon all errands I had to curry the horse to clean and feed him and sometimes to ride him a little I had more than enough to do but still it was not so very bad as Turk's Island My old master often got drunk and then he would get in a fury with his daughter and beat her till she was not fit to be seen I remember on one occasion I had gone to fetch water and when I was coming up the hill I heard a great screaming I ran as fast as I could to the house put down the water and went into the chamber where I found my master beating Miss D dreadfully I strove with all my strength to get her away from him for she was all black and blue with bruises He had beat her with his fist and almost killed her The people gave me credit for getting her away He turned round and began to lick me Then I said Sir this is not Turk's Island I can't repeat his answer the words were too wicked too bad to say He wanted to treat me the same in Bermuda as he had done in Turk's Island He had an ugly fashion of stripping himself quite naked and ordering me then to wash him in a tub of water This was worse to me than all the licks Sometimes when he called me to wash him I would not come my eyes were so full of shame He would then come to beat me One time I had plates and knives in my hand and I dropped both plates and knives and some of the plates were broken He struck me so severely for this that at last I defended myself for I thought it was high time to do so I then told him I would not live longer with him for he was a very indecent man very spiteful and too indecent with no shame for his servants no shame for his own flesh So I went away to a neighbouring house and sat down and cried till the next morning when I went home again not knowing what else to do After that I was hired to work at Cedar Hills and every Saturday night I paid the money to my master I had plenty of work to do there Page plenty of washing but yet I made myself pretty comfortable I earned two dollars and a quarter a week which is twenty pence a day During the time I worked there I heard that Mr John Wood was going to Antigua I felt a great wish to go there and I went to Mr D and asked him to let me go in Mr Wood's service Mr Wood did not then want to purchase me it was my own fault that I came under him I was so anxious to go It was ordained to be I suppose God led me there The truth is I did not wish to be any longer the slave of my indecent master Mr Wood took me with him to Antigua to the town of St John's where he lived This was about fifteen years ago He did not then know whether I was to be sold but Mrs Wood found that I could work and she wanted to buy me Her husband then wrote to my master to inquire whether I was to be sold Mr D wrote in reply that I should not be sold to any one that would treat me ill It was strange he should say this when he had treated me so ill himself So I was purchased by Mr Wood for dollars or Bermuda currency About s sterling My work there was to attend the chambers and nurse the child and to go down to the pond and wash clothes But I soon fell ill of the rheumatism and grew so very lame that I was forced to walk with a stick I got the Saint Anthony's fire also in my left leg and became quite a cripple No one cared much to come near me and I was ill a long long time for several months I could not lift the limb I had to lie in a little old out house that was swarming with bugs and other vermin which tormented me greatly but I had no other place to lie in I got the rheumatism by catching cold at the pond side from washing in the fresh water in the salt water I never got cold The person who lived in next yard a Mrs Greene could not bear to hear my cries and groans She was kind and used to send an old slave woman to help me who sometimes brought me a little soup When the doctor found I was so ill he said I must be put into a bath of hot water The old slave got the bark of some bush that was good for the pains which she boiled in the hot water and every night she came and put me into the bath and did what she could for me I don't know what I should have done or what would have become of me had it not been for her My mistress it is true did send me a little food but no one from our family came near me but the cook who used to shove my food in at the door and say Molly Molly there's your dinner My mistress did not care to take any trouble about me and if the Lord had not put it into the hearts of the neighbours to be kind to me I must I really think have lain and died It was a long time before I got well enough to work in the house Mrs Wood in the meanwhile hired a mulatto woman to nurse the child but she was such a fine lady she wanted to be mistress over me I thought it very hard for a coloured woman to have rule over me because I was a slave and she was free Her name was Martha Wilcox she was a saucy woman very saucy and she went and complained of Page me without cause to my mistress and made her angry with me Mrs Wood told me that if I did not mind what I was about she would get my master to strip me and give me fifty lashes You have been used to the whip she said and you shall have it here This was the first time she threatened to have me flogged and she gave me the threatening so strong of what she would have done to me that I thought I should have fallen down at her feet I was so vexed and hurt by her words The mulatto woman was rejoiced to have power to keep me down She was constantly making mischief there was no living for the slaves no peace after she came I was also sent by Mrs Wood to be put in the Cage one night and was next morning flogged by the magistrate's order at her desire and this all for a quarrel I had about a pig with another slave woman I was flogged on my naked back on this occasion although I was in no fault after all for old Justice Dyett when we came before him said that I was in the right and ordered the pig to be given to me This was about two or three years after I came to Antigua When we moved from the middle of the town to the Point I used to be in the house and do all the work and mind the children though still very ill with the rheumatism Every week I had to wash two large bundles of clothes as much as a boy could help me to lift but I could give no satisfaction My mistress was always abusing and fretting after me It is not possible to tell all her ill language One day she followed me foot after foot scolding and rating me I bore in silence a great deal of ill words at last my heart was quite full and I told her that she ought not to use me so that when I was ill I might have lain and died for what she cared and no one would then come near me to nurse me because they were afraid of my mistress This was a great affront She called her husband and told him what I had said He flew into a passion but did not beat me then he only abused and swore at me and then gave me a note and bade me go and look for an owner Not that he meant to sell me but he did this to please his wife and to frighten me I went to Adam White a cooper a free black who had money and asked him to buy me He went directly to Mr Wood but was informed that I was not to be sold The next day my master whipped me Another time about five years ago my mistress got vexed with me because I fell sick and I could not keep on with my work She complained to her husband and he sent me off again to look for an owner I went to a Mr Burchell showed him the note and asked him to buy me for my own benefit for I had saved about dollars and hoped with a little help to purchase my freedom He accordingly went to my master Mr Wood he said Molly has brought me a note that she wants an owner If you intend to sell her I may as well buy her as another My master put him off and said that he did not mean to sell me I was very sorry at this for I had no comfort with Mrs Wood and I wished greatly to get my freedom The way in which I made my money was this When my master and mistress went from home as they sometimes did and left me to take care of the house and premises I had a good deal of time to myself and made the most of it I took in washing and sold coffee and yams Page and other provisions to the captains of ships I did not sit still idling during the absence of my owners for I wanted by all honest means to earn money to buy my freedom Sometimes I bought a hog cheap on board ship and sold it for double the money on shore and I also earned a good deal by selling coffee By this means I by degrees acquired a little cash A gentleman also lent me some to help to buy my freedom but when I could not get free he got it back again His name was Captain Abbot My master and mistress went on one occasion into the country to Date Hill for change of air and carried me with them to take charge of the children and to do the work of the house While I was in the country I saw how the field negroes are worked in Antigua They are worked very hard and fed but scantily They are called out to work before daybreak and come home after dark and then each has to heave his bundle of grass for the cattle in the pen Then on Sunday morning each slave has to go out and gather a large bundle of grass and when they bring it home they have all to sit at the manager's door and wait till he come out often have they to wait there till past eleven o'clock without any breakfast After that those that have yams or potatoes or fire wood to sell hasten to market to buy a dog's worth A dog is the nd part of a dollar of salt fish or pork which is a great treat for them Some of them buy a little pickle out of the shad barrels which they call sauce to season their yams and Indian corn It is very wrong I know to work on Sunday or go to market but will not God call the Buckra men to answer for this on the great day of judgment since they will give the slaves no other day While we were at Date Hill Christmas came and the slave woman who had the care of the place which then belonged to Mr Roberts the marshal asked me to go with her to her husband's house to a Methodist meeting for prayer at a plantation called Winthorps I went and they were the first prayers I ever understood One woman prayed and then they all sung a hymn then there was another prayer and another hymn and then they all spoke by turns of their own griefs as sinners The husband of the woman I went with was a black driver His name was Henry He confessed that he had treated the slaves very cruelly but said that he was compelled to obey the orders of his master He prayed them all to forgive him and he prayed that God would forgive him He said it was a horrid thing for a ranger The head negro of an estate a person who has the chief superintendence under the manager to have sometimes to beat his own wife or sister but he must do so if ordered by his master I felt sorry for my sins also I cried the whole night but I was too much ashamed to speak I prayed God to forgive me This meeting had a great impression on my mind and led my spirit to the Moravian church so that when I got back to town I went and prayed to have my name put down in the Missionaries' book and I followed the church earnestly every opportunity I did not then tell my mistress about it for I knew that she would not give me leave to go But I felt I must go Page Whenever I carried the children their lunch at school I ran round and went to hear the teachers The Moravian ladies Mrs Richter Mrs Olufsen and Mrs Sauter taught me to read in the class and I got on very fast In this class there were all sorts of people old and young grey headed folks and children but most of them were free people After we had done spelling we tried to read in the Bible After the reading was over the missionary gave out a hymn for us to sing I dearly loved to go to the church it was so solemn I never knew rightly that I had much sin till I went there When I found out that I was a great sinner I was very sorely grieved and very much frightened I used to pray God to pardon my sins for Christ's sake and forgive me for every thing I had done amiss and when I went home to my work I always thought about what I had heard from the missionaries and wished to be good that I might go to heaven After a while I was admitted a candidate for the holy Communion I had been baptized long before this in the year by the Rev Mr Curtin of the English Church after I had been taught to repeat the Creed and the Lord's Prayer I wished at that time to attend a Sunday School taught by Mr Curtin but he would not receive me without a written note from my master granting his permission I did not ask my owner's permission from the belief that it would be refused so that I got no farther instruction at that time from the English Church She possesses a copy of Mrs Trimmer's Charity School Spelling Book presented to her by the Rev Mr Curtin and dated August In this book her name is written Mary Princess of Wales an appellation which she says was given her by her owners It is a common practice with the colonists to give ridiculous names of this description to their slaves being in fact one of the numberless modes of expressing the habitual contempt with which they regard the negro race In printing this narrative we have retained Mary's paternal name of Prince Ed Some time after I began to attend the Moravian Church I met with Daniel James afterwards my dear husband He was a carpenter and cooper to his trade an honest hard working decent black man and a widower He had purchased his freedom of his mistress old Mrs Baker with money he had earned whilst a slave When he asked me to marry him I took time to consider the matter over with myself and would not say yes till he went to church with me and joined the Moravians He was very industrious after he bought his freedom and he had hired a comfortable house and had convenient things about him We were joined in marriage about Christmas in the Moravian Chapel at Spring Gardens by the Rev Mr Olufsen We could not be married in the English Church English marriage is not allowed to slaves and no free man can marry a slave woman When Mr Wood heard of my marriage he flew into a great rage and sent for Daniel who was helping to build a house for his old mistress Mr Wood asked him who gave him a right to marry a slave of his My husband said Sir I am a free man and thought I had a right to choose a wife but if I had known Molly was not allowed to have a husband I should not have asked her to marry me Mrs Wood was more vexed about my marriage than her husband She could not forgive Page me for getting married but stirred up Mr Wood to flog me dreadfully with the horsewhip I thought it very hard to be whipped at my time of life for getting a husband I told her so She said that she would not have nigger men about the yards and premises or allow a nigger man's clothes to be washed in the same tub where hers were washed She was fearful I think that I should lose her time in order to wash and do things for my husband but I had then no time to wash for myself I was obliged to put out my own clothes though I was always at the wash tub I had not much happiness in my marriage owing to my being a slave It made my husband sad to see me so ill treated Mrs Wood was always abusing me about him She did not lick me herself but she got her husband to do it for her whilst she fretted the flesh off my bones Yet for all this she would not sell me She sold five slaves whilst I was with her but though she was always finding fault with me she would not part with me However Mr Wood afterwards allowed Daniel to have a place to live in our yard which we were very thankful for After this I fell ill again with the rheumatism and was sick a long time but whether sick or well I had my work to do About this time I asked my master and mistress to let me buy my own freedom With the help of Mr Burchell I could have found the means to pay Mr Wood for it was agreed that I should afterwards serve Mr Burchell a while for the cash he was to advance for me I was earnest in the request to my owners but their hearts were hard too hard to consent Mrs Wood was very angry she grew quite outrageous she called me a black devil and asked me who had put freedom into my head To be free is very sweet I said but she took good care to keep me a slave I saw her change colour and I left the room About this time my master and mistress were going to England to put their son to school and bring their daughters home and they took me with them to take care of the child I was willing to come to England I thought that by going there I should probably get cured of my rheumatism and should return with my master and mistress quite well to my husband My husband was willing for me to come away for he had heard that my master would free me and I also hoped this might prove true but it was all a false report The steward of the ship was very kind to me He and my husband were in the same class in the Moravian Church I was thankful that he was so friendly for my mistress was not kind to me on the passage and she told me when she was angry that she did not intend to treat me any better in England than in the West Indies that I need not expect it And she was as good as her word When we drew near to England the rheumatism seized all my limbs worse than ever and my body was dreadfully swelled When we landed at the Tower I shewed my flesh to my mistress but she took no great notice of it We were obliged to stop at the tavern till my master got a house and a day or two after my mistress sent me down into the wash house to learn to wash in the English way In the West Indies we wash with cold water in England with hot I told my mistress I was afraid that putting my hands first into the hot water and then Page into the cold would increase the pain in my limbs The doctor had told my mistress long before I came from the West Indies that I was a sickly body and the washing did not agree with me But Mrs Wood would not release me from the tub so I was forced to do as I could I grew worse and could not stand to wash I was then forced to sit down with the tub before me and often through pain and weakness was reduced to kneel or to sit down on the floor to finish my task When I complained to my mistress of this she only got into a passion as usual and said washing in hot water could not hurt any one that I was lazy and insolent and wanted to be free of my work but that she would make me do it I thought her very hard on me and my heart rose up within me However I kept still at that time and went down again to wash the child's things but the English washerwomen who were at work there when they saw that I was so ill had pity upon me and washed them for me After that when we came up to live in Leigh Street Mrs Wood sorted out five bags of clothes which we had used at sea and also such as had been worn since we came on shore for me and the cook to wash Elizabeth the cook told her that she did not think that I was able to stand to the tub and that she had better hire a woman I also said myself that I had come over to nurse the child and that I was sorry I had come from Antigua since mistress would work me so hard without compassion for my rheumatism Mr and Mrs Wood when they heard this rose up in a passion against me They opened the door and bade me get out But I was a stranger and did not know one door in the street from another and was unwilling to go away They made a dreadful uproar and from that day they constantly kept cursing and abusing me I was obliged to wash though I was very ill Mrs Wood indeed once hired a washerwoman but she was not well treated and would come no more My master quarrelled with me another time about one of our great washings his wife having stirred him up to do so He said he would compel me to do the whole of the washing given out to me or if I again refused he would take a short course with me he would either send me down to the brig in the river to carry me back to Antigua or he would turn me at once out of doors and let me provide for myself I said I would willingly go back if he would let me purchase my own freedom But this enraged him more than all the rest he cursed and swore at me dreadfully and said he would never sell my freedom if I wished to be free I was free in England and I might go and try what freedom would do for me and be d d My heart was very sore with this treatment but I had to go on I continued to do my work and did all I could to give satisfaction but all would not do Shortly after the cook left them and then matters went on ten times worse I always washed the child's clothes without being commanded to do it and any thing else that was wanted in the family though still I was very sick very sick indeed When the great washing came round which was every two months my mistress got together again a great many heavy things such as bed ticks bed coverlets c for me to wash I told her I was too ill to wash such heavy things that day Page She said she supposed I thought myself a free woman but I was not and if I did not do it directly I should be instantly turned out of doors I stood a long time before I could answer for I did not know well what to do I knew that I was free in England but I did not know where to go or how to get my living and therefore I did not like to leave the house But Mr Wood said he would send for a constable to thrust me out and at last I took courage and resolved that I would not be longer thus treated but would go and trust to Providence This was the fourth time they had threatened to turn me out and go where I might I was determined now to take them at their word though I thought it very hard after I had lived with them for thirteen years and worked for them like a horse to be driven out in this way like a beggar My only fault was being sick and therefore unable to please my mistress who thought she never could get work enough out of her slaves and I told them so but they only abused me and drove me out This took place from two to three months I think after we came to England When I came away I went to the man one Mash who used to black the shoes of the family and asked his wife to get somebody to go with me to Hatton Garden to the Moravian Missionaries these were the only persons I knew in England The woman sent a young girl with me to the mission house and I saw there a gentleman called Mr Moore I told him my whole story and how my owners had treated me and asked him to take in my trunk with what few clothes I had The missionaries were very kind to me they were sorry for my destitute situation and gave me leave to bring my things to be placed under their care They were very good people and they told me to come to the church When I went back to Mr Wood's to get my trunk I saw a lady Mrs Pell who was on a visit to my mistress When Mr and Mrs Wood heard me come in they set this lady to stop me finding that they had gone too far with me Mrs Pell came out to me and said Are you really going to leave Molly Don't leave but come into the country with me I believe she said this because she thought Mrs Wood would easily get me back again I replied to her Ma'am this is the fourth time my master and mistress have driven me out or threatened to drive me and I will give them no more occasion to bid me go I was not willing to leave them for I am a stranger in this country but now I must go I can stay no longer to be so used Mrs Pell then went up stairs to my mistress and told that I would go and that she could not stop me Mrs Wood was very much hurt and frightened when she found I was determined to go out that day She said If she goes the people will rob her and then turn her adrift She did not say this to me but she spoke it loud enough for me to hear that it might induce me not to go I suppose Mr Wood also asked me where I was going to I told him where I had been and that I should never have gone away had I not been driven out by my owners He had given me a written paper some time before which said that I had come with them to England by my own desire and that was true It said also that I left them of my own free will because I was a free woman in England and that Page I was idle and would not do my work which was not true I gave this paper afterwards to a gentleman who inquired into my case See page I went into the kitchen and got my clothes out The nurse and the servant girl were there and I said to the man who was going to take out my trunk Stop before you take up this trunk and hear what I have to say before these people I am going out of this house as I was ordered but I have done no wrong at all to my owners neither here nor in the West Indies I always worked very hard to please them both by night and day but there was no giving satisfaction for my mistress could never be satisfied with reasonable service I told my mistress I was sick and yet she has ordered me out of doors This is the fourth time and now I am going out And so I came out and went and carried my trunk to the Moravians I then returned back to Mash the shoe black's house and begged his wife to take me in I had a little West Indian money in my trunk and they got it changed for me This helped to support me for a little while The man's wife was very kind to me I was very sick and she boiled nourishing things up for me She also sent for a doctor to see me and he sent me medicine which did me good though I was ill for a long time with the rheumatic pains I lived a good many months with these poor people and they nursed me and did all that lay in their power to serve me The man was well acquainted with my situation as he used to go to and fro to Mr Wood's house to clean shoes and knives and he and his wife were sorry for me About this time a woman of the name of Hill told me of the Anti Slavery Society and went with me to their office to inquire if they could do any thing to get me my freedom and send me back to the West Indies The gentlemen of the Society took me to a lawyer who examined very strictly into my case but told me that the laws of England could do nothing to make me free in Antigua She came first to the Anti Slavery Office in Aldermanbury about the latter end of November and her case was referred to Mr George Stephen to be investigated More of this hereafter ED However they did all they could for me they gave me a little money from time to time to keep me from want and some of them went to Mr Wood to try to persuade him to let me return a free woman to my husband but though they offered him as I have heard a large sum for my freedom he was sulky and obstinate and would not consent to let me go free This was the first winter I spent in England and I suffered much from the severe cold and from the rheumatic pains which still at times torment me However Providence was very good to me and I got many friends especially some Quaker ladies who hearing of my case came and sought me out and gave me good warm clothing and money Thus I had great cause to bless God in my affliction When I got better I was anxious to get some work to do as I was unwilling to eat the bread of idleness Mrs Mash who was a laundress recommended me to a lady for a charwoman She paid me very handsomely for what work I did and I divided the money with Mrs Page Mash for though very poor they gave me food when my own money was done and never suffered me to want In the spring I got into service with a lady who saw me at the house where I sometimes worked as a charwoman This lady's name was Mrs Forsyth She had been in the West Indies and was accustomed to Blacks and liked them I was with her six months and went with her to Margate She treated me well and gave me a good character when she left London She refers to a written certificate which will be inserted afterwards After Mrs Forsyth went away I was again out of place and went to lodgings for which I paid two shillings a week and found coals and candle After eleven weeks the money I had saved in service was all gone and I was forced to go back to the Anti Slavery office to ask a supply till I could get another situation I did not like to go back I did not like to be idle I would rather work for my living than get it for nothing They were very good to give me a supply but I felt shame at being obliged to apply for relief whilst I had strength to work At last I went into the service of Mr and Mrs Pringle where I have been ever since and am as comfortable as I can be while separated from my dear husband and away from my own country and all old friends and connections My dear mistress teaches me daily to read the word of God and takes great pains to make me understand it I enjoy the great privilege of being enabled to attend church three times on the Sunday and I have met with many kind friends since I have been here both clergymen and others The Rev Mr Young who lives in the next house has shown me much kindness and taken much pains to instruct me particularly while my master and mistress were absent in Scotland Nor must I forget among my friends the Rev Mr Mortimer the good clergyman of the parish under whose ministry I have now sat for upwards of twelve months I trust in God I have profited by what I have heard from him He never keeps back the truth and I think he has been the means of opening my eyes and ears much better to understand the word of God Mr Mortimer tells me that he cannot open the eyes of my heart but that I must pray to God to change my heart and make me to know the truth and the truth will make me free I still live in the hope that God will find a way to give me my liberty and give me back to my husband I endeavour to keep down my fretting and to leave all to Him for he knows what is good for me better than I know myself Yet I must confess I find it a hard and heavy task to do so I am often much vexed and I feel great sorrow when I hear some people in this country say that the slaves do not need better usage and do not want to be free The whole of this paragraph especially is given as nearly as was possible in Mary's precise words They believe the foreign people She means West Indians who deceive them and say slaves are happy I say Not so How can slaves be happy when they have the halter round their neck and the Page whip upon their back and are disgraced and thought no more of than beasts and are separated from their mothers and husbands and children and sisters just as cattle are sold and separated Is it happiness for a driver in the field to take down his wife or sister or child and strip them and whip them in such a disgraceful manner women that have had children exposed in the open field to shame There is no modesty or decency shown by the owner to his slaves men women and children are exposed alike Since I have been here I have often wondered how English people can go out into the West Indies and act in such a beastly manner But when they go to the West Indies they forget God and all feeling of shame I think since they can see and do such things They tie up slaves like hogs moor A West Indian phrase to fasten or tie up them up like cattle and they lick them so as hogs or cattle or horses never were flogged and yet they come home and say and make some good people believe that slaves don't want to get out of slavery But they put a cloak about the truth It is not so All slaves want to be free to be free is very sweet I will say the truth to English people who may read this history that my good friend Miss S is now writing down for me I have been a slave myself I know what slaves feel I can tell by myself what other slaves feel and by what they have told me The man that says slaves be quite happy in slavery that they don't want to be free that man is either ignorant or a lying person I never heard a slave say so I never heard a Buckra man say so till I heard tell of it in England Such people ought to be ashamed of themselves They can't do without slaves they say What's the reason they can't do without slaves as well as in England No slaves here no whips no stocks no punishment except for wicked people They hire servants in England and if they don't like them they send them away they can't lick them Let them work ever so hard in England they are far better off than slaves If they get a bad master they give warning and go hire to another They have their liberty That's just what we want We don't mind hard work if we had proper treatment and proper wages like English servants and proper time given in the week to keep us from breaking the Sabbath But they won't give it they will have work work work night and day sick or well till we are quite done up and we must not speak up nor look amiss however much we be abused And then when we are quite done up who cares for us more than for a lame horse This is slavery I tell it to let English people know the truth and I hope they will never leave off to pray God and call loud to the great King of England till all the poor blacks be given free and slavery done up for evermore Page SUPPLEMENT TO THE HISTORY OF MARY PRINCE BY THE EDITOR LEAVING Mary's narrative for the present without comment to the reader's reflections I proceed to state some circumstances connected with her case which have fallen more particularly under my own notice and which I consider it incumbent now to lay fully before the public About the latter end of November this poor woman found her way to the office of the Anti Slavery Society in Aldermanbury by the aid of a person who had become acquainted with her situation and had advised her to apply there for advice and assistance After some preliminary examination into the accuracy of the circumstances related by her I went along with her to Mr George Stephen solicitor and requested him to investigate and draw up a statement of her case and have it submitted to counsel in order to ascertain whether or not under the circumstances her freedom could be legally established on her return to Antigua On this occasion in Mr Stephen's presence and mine she expressed in very strong terms her anxiety to return thither if she could go as a free person and at the same time her extreme apprehensions of the fate that would probably await her if she returned as a slave Her words were I would rather go into my grave than go back a slave to Antigua though I wish to go back to my husband very much very much very much I am much afraid my owners would separate me from my husband and use me very hard or perhaps sell me for a field negro and slavery is too too bad I would rather go into my grave The paper which Mr Wood had given her before she left his house was placed by her in Mr Stephen's hands It was expressed in the following terms I have already told Molly and now give it her in writing in order that there may be no misunderstanding on her part that as I brought her from Antigua at her own request and entreaty and that she is consequently now free she is of course at liberty to take her baggage and go where she pleases And in consequence of her late conduct she must do one of two things either quit the house or return to Antigua by the earliest opportunity as she does not evince a disposition to make herself useful As she is a stranger in London I do not wish to turn Page her out or would do so as two female servants are sufficient for my establishment If after this she does remain it will be only during her good behaviour but on no consideration will I allow her wages or any other remuneration for her services JOHN A WOOD London August This paper though not devoid of inconsistencies which will be apparent to any attentive reader is craftily expressed and was well devised to serve the purpose which the writer had obviously in view namely to frustrate any appeal which the friendless black woman might make to the sympathy of strangers and thus prevent her from obtaining an asylum if she left his house from any respectable family As she had no one to refer to for a character in this country except himself he doubtless calculated securely on her being speedily driven back as soon as the slender fund she had in her possession was expended to throw herself unconditionally upon his tender mercies and his disappointment in this expectation appears to have exasperated his feelings of resentment towards the poor woman to a degree which few persons alive to the claims of common justice not to speak of christianity or common humanity could easily have anticipated Such at least seems the only intelligible inference that can be drawn from his subsequent conduct The case having been submitted by desire of the Anti Slavery Committee to the consideration of Dr Lushington and Mr Sergeant Stephen it was found that there existed no legal means of compelling Mary's master to grant her manumission and that if she returned to Antigua she would inevitably fall again under his power or that of his attorneys as a slave It was however resolved to try what could be effected for her by amicable negotiation and with this view Mr Ravenscroft a solicitor Mr G Stephen's relative called upon Mr Wood in order to ascertain whether he would consent to Mary's manumission on any reasonable terms and to refer if required the amount of compensation for her value to arbitration Mr Ravenscroft with some difficulty obtained one or two interviews but found Mr Wood so full of animosity against the woman and so firmly bent against any arrangement having her freedom for its object that the negotiation was soon broken off as hopeless The angry slave owner declared that he would not move a finger about her in this country or grant her manumission on any terms whatever and that if she went back to the West Indies she must take the consequences This unreasonable conduct of Mr Wood induced the Anti Slavery Committee after several other abortive attempts to effect a compromise to think of bringing the case under the notice of Parliament The heads of Mary's statement were accordingly engrossed in a Petition which Dr Lushington offered to present and to give notice at the same time of his intention to bring in a Bill to provide for the entire emancipation of all slaves brought to England with the owner's consent But before this step was taken Dr Lushington again had recourse to negociation with the master and partly through the friendly intervention of Mr Manning partly by personal conference used every persuasion in his power to induce Mr Wood to relent and let the bondwoman go free Page Seeing the matter thus seriously taken up Mr Wood became at length alarmed not relishing it appears the idea of having the case publicly discussed in the House of Commons and to avert this result he submitted to temporize assumed a demeanour of unwonted civility and even hinted to Mr Manning as I was given to understand that if he was not driven to utter hostility by the threatened exposure he would probably meet our wishes in his own time and way Having gained time by these manoeuvres he adroitly endeavoured to cool the ardour of Mary's new friends in her cause by representing her as an abandoned and worthless woman ungrateful towards him and undeserving of sympathy from others allegations which he supported by the ready affirmation of some of his West India friends and by one or two plausible letters procured from Antigua By these and like artifices he appears completely to have imposed on Mr Manning the respectable West India merchant whom Dr Lushington had asked to negotiate with him and he prevailed so far as to induce Dr Lushington himself actuated by the benevolent view of thereby best serving Mary's cause to abstain from any remarks upon his conduct when the petition was at last presented in Parliament In this way he dextrously contrived to neutralize all our efforts until the close of the Session of soon after which he embarked with his family for the West Indies Every exertion for Mary's relief having thus failed and being fully convinced from a twelvemonth's observation of her conduct that she was really a well disposed and respectable woman I engaged her in December as a domestic servant in my own family In this capacity she has remained ever since and I am thus enabled to speak of her conduct and character with a degree of confidence I could not have otherwise done The importance of this circumstance will appear in the sequel From the time of Mr Wood's departure to Antigua in till June or July last no farther effort was attempted for Mary's relief Some faint hope was still cherished that this unconscionable man would at length relent and in his own time and way grant the prayer of the exiled negro woman After waiting however nearly twelvemonths longer and seeing the poor woman's spirits daily sinking under the sickening influence of hope deferred I resolved on a final attempt in her behalf through the intervention of the Moravian Missionaries and of the Governor of Antigua At my request Mr Edward Moore agent of the Moravian Brethren in London wrote to the Rev Joseph Newby their Missionary in that island empowering him to negotiate in his own name with Mr Wood for Mary's manumission and to procure his consent if possible upon terms of ample pecuniary compensation At the same time the excellent and benevolent William Allen of the Society of Friends wrote to Sir Patrick Ross the Governor of the Colony with whom he was on terms of friendship soliciting him to use his influence in persuading Mr Wood to consent and I confess I was sanguine enough to flatter myself that we should thus at length prevail The result proved however that I had not yet fully appreciated the character of the man we had to deal with Mr Newby's answer arrived early in November last mentioning that Page he had done all in his power to accomplish our purpose but in vain and that if Mary's manumission could not be obtained without Mr Wood's consent he believed there was no prospect of its ever being effected A few weeks afterwards I was informed by Mr Allen that he had received a letter from Sir Patrick Ross stating that he also had used his best endeavours in the affair but equally without effect Sir Patrick at the same time inclosed a letter addressed by Mr Wood to his Secretary Mr Taylor assigning his reasons for persisting in this extraordinary course This letter requires our special attention Its tenor is as follows My dear Sir In reply to your note relative to the woman Molly I beg you will have the kindness to oblige me by assuring his Excellency that I regret exceedingly my inability to comply with his request which under other circumstances would afford me very great pleasure There are many and powerful reasons for inducing me to refuse my sanction to her returning here in the way she seems to wish It would be to reward the worst species of ingratitude and subject myself to insult whenever she came in my way Her moral character is very bad as the police records will shew and she would be a very troublesome character should she come here without any restraint She is not a native of this country and I know of no relation she has here I induced her to take a husband a short time before she left this by providing a comfortable house in my yard for them and prohibiting her going out after to o'clock our bed time without special leave This she considered the greatest and indeed the only grievance she ever complained of and all my efforts could not prevent it In hopes of inducing her to be steady to her husband who was a free man I gave him the house to occupy during our absence but it appears the attachment was too loose to bind her and he has taken another wife so on that score I do her no injury In England she made her election and quitted my family This I had no right to object to and I should have thought no more of it but not satisfied to leave quietly she gave every trouble and annoyance in her power and endeavoured to injure the character of my family by the most vile and infamous falsehoods which was embodied in a petition to the House of Commons and would have been presented had not my friends from this island particularly the Hon Mr Byam and Dr Coull come forward and disproved what she had asserted It would be beyond the limits of an ordinary letter to detail her baseness though I will do so should his Excellency wish it but you may judge of her depravity by one circumstance which came out before Mr Justice Dyett in a quarrel with another female Such a thing I could not have believed possible I omit the circumstance here mentioned because it is too indecent to appear in a publication likely to be perused by females It is in all probability a vile calumny but even if it were perfectly true it would not serve Mr Wood's case one straw Any reader who wishes it may see the passage referred to in the autograph letter in my possession T P Losing her value as a slave in a pecuniary point of view I consider of no consequence for it was our intention had she conducted herself properly and returned with us to have given her freedom She has taken her freedom and all I wish is that she would enjoy it without meddling with me Let me again repeat if his Excellency wishes it it will afford me great pleasure Page to state such particulars of her and which will be incontestably proved by numbers here that I am sure will acquit me in his opinion of acting unkind or ungenerous towards her I'll say nothing of the liability I should incur under the Consolidated Slave Law of dealing with a free person as a slave My only excuse for entering so much into detail must be that of my anxious wish to stand justified in his Excellency's opinion I am my dear Sir Yours very truly JOHN A WOOD th Oct Charles Taylor Esq c c c I forgot to mention that it was at her own special request that she accompanied me to England and also that she had a considerable sum of money with her which she had saved in my service I knew of to at least for I had some trouble to recover it from a white man to whom she had lent it J A W Such is Mr Wood's justification of his conduct in thus obstinately refusing manumission to the Negro woman who had escaped from his house of bondage Let us now endeavour to estimate the validity of the excuses assigned and the allegations advanced by him for the information of Governor Sir Patrick Ross in this deliberate statement of his case To allow the woman to return home free would he affirms be to reward the worst species of ingratitude He assumes it seems the sovereign power of pronouncing a virtual sentence of banishment for the alleged crime of ingratitude Is this then a power which any man ought to possess over his fellow mortal or which any goodman would ever wish to exercise And besides there is no evidence whatever beyond Mr Wood's mere assertion that Mary Prince owed him or his family the slightest mark of gratitude Her account of the treatment she received in his service may be incorrect but her simple statement is at least supported by minute and feasible details and unless rebutted by positive facts will certainly command credence from impartial minds more readily than his angry accusation which has something absurd and improbable in its very front Moreover is it not absurd to term the assertion of her natural rights by a slave even supposing her to have been kindly dealt with by her owners and treated in every respect the reverse of what Mary affirms to have been her treatment by Mr Wood and his wife the worst species of ingratitude This may be West Indian ethics but it will scarcely be received as sound doctrine in Europe To permit her return would be to subject himself to insult whenever she came in his way This is a most extraordinary assertion Are the laws of Antigua then so favourable to the free blacks or the colonial police so feebly administered that there are no sufficient restraints to protect a rich colonist like Mr Wood a man who counts among his familiar friends the Honourable Mr Byam and Mr Taylor the Government Secretary from being insulted by a poor Negro woman It is preposterous Her moral character is so bad that she would prove very trouble some should she come to the colony without any restraint Page Any restraint Are there no restraints supposing them necessary short of absolute slavery to keep troublesome characters in order But this I suppose is the argumentum ad gubernatorem to frighten the governor She is such a termagant it seems that if she once gets back to the colony free she will not only make it too hot for poor Mr Wood but the police and courts of justice will scarce be a match for her Sir Patrick Ross no doubt will take care how he intercedes farther for so formidable a virago How can one treat such arguments seriously She is not a native of the colony and he knows of no relation she has there True But was it not her home so far as a slave can have a home for thirteen or fourteen years Were not the connexions friendships and associations of her mature life formed there Was it not there she hoped to spend her latter years in domestic tranquillity with her husband free from the lash of the taskmaster These consideratious may appear light to Mr Wood but they are every thing to this poor woman He induced her he says to take a husband a short time before she left Antigua and gave them a comfortable house in his yard c c This paragraph merits attention He induced her to take a husband If the fact were true what brutality of mind and manners does it not indicate among these slave holders They refuse to legalize the marriages of their slaves but induce them to form such temporary connexions as may suit the owner's conveniency just as they would pair the lower animals and this man has the effrontery to tell us so Mary however tells a very different story see page and her assertion independently of other proof is at least as credible as Mr Wood's The reader will judge for himself as to the preponderance of internal evidence in the conflicting statements He alleges that she was before marriage licentious and even depraved in her conduct and unfaithful to her husband afterwards These are serious charges But if true or even partially true how comes it that a person so correct in his family hours and arrangements as Mr Wood professes to be and who expresses so edifying a horror of licentiousness could reconcile it to his conscience to keep in the bosom of his family so depraved as well as so troublesome a character for at least thirteen years and confide to her for long periods too the charge of his house and the care of his children for such I shall shew to have been the facts How can he account for not having rid himself with all speed of so disreputable an inmate he who values her loss so little in a pecuniary point of view How can he account for having sold five other slaves in that period and yet have retained this shocking woman nay even have refused to sell her on more than one occasion when offered her full value It could not be from ignorance of her character for the circumstance which he adduces as a proof of her shameless depravity and which I have omitted on account of its indecency occurred it would appear not less than ten years ago Yet not with standing her alleged ill qualities and habits of gross immorality he has not only constantly refused to part with her but after thirteen long years brings her to England as an attendant on his wife and children with the avowed intention of carrying her back along with his maiden daughter a young Page lady returning from school Such are the extraordinary facts and until Mr Wood shall reconcile these singular inconsistencies between his actions and his allegations he must not be surprised if we in England prefer giving credit to the former rather than the latter although at present it appears somewhat difficult to say which side of the alternative is the more creditable to his own character Her husband he says has taken another wife so that on that score he adds he does her no injury Supposing this fact be true which I doubt as I doubt every mere assertion from so questionable a quarter I shall take leave to put a question or two to Mr Wood's conscience Did he not write from England to his friend Mr Darrel soon after Mary left his house directing him to turn her husband Daniel James off his premises on account of her offence telling him to inform James at the same time that his wife had taken up with another man who had robbed her of all she had a calumny as groundless as it was cruel I further ask if the person who invented this story whoever he may be was not likely enough to impose similar fabrications on the poor negro man's credulity until be may have been induced to prove false to his marriage vows and to take another wife as Mr Wood coolly expresses it But withal I strongly doubt the fact of Daniel James' infidelity for there is now before me a letter from himself to Mary dated in April couched in strong terms of conjugal affection expressing his anxiety for her speedy return and stating that he had lately received a grace a token of religious advancement in the Moravian church a circumstance altogether incredible if the man were living in open adultery as Mr Wood's assertion implies Mary he says endeavoured to injure the character of his family by infamous falsehoods which were embodied in a petition to the House of Commons and would have been presented had not his friends from Antigua the Hon Mr Byam and Dr Coull disproved her assertions I can say something on this point from my own knowledge Mary's petition contained simply a brief statement of her case and among other things mentioned the treatment she had received from Mr and Mrs Wood Now the principal facts are corroborated by other evidence and Mr Wood must bring forward very different testimony from that of Dr Coull before well informed persons will give credit to his contradiction The value of that person's evidence in such cases will be noticed presently Of the Hon Mr Byam I know nothing and shall only at present remark that it is not likely to redound greatly to his credit to appear in such company Furthermore Mary's petition was presented as Mr Wood ought to know though it was not discussed nor his conduct exposed as it ought to have been He speaks of the liability he should incur under the Consolidated Slave Law of dealing with a free person as a slave Is not this pretext hypocritical in the extreme What liability could he possibly incur by voluntarily resigning the power conferred on him by an iniquitous colonial law of re imposing the shackles of slavery on the bondwoman from whose limbs they had fallen when she touched the free soil of England There exists no liability from which he might not have been easily secured or for which he would not have been fully compensated Page He adds in a postscript that Mary had a considerable sum of money with her from to at least which she had saved in his service The fact is that she had at one time dollars in cash but only a very small portion of that sum appears to have been brought by her to England the rest having been partly advanced as she states to assist her husband and partly lost by being lodged in unfaithful custody Finally Mr Wood repeats twice that it will afford him great pleasure to state for the governor's satisfaction if required such particulars of the woman Molly upon incontestable evidence as he is sure will acquit him in his Excellency's opinion of acting unkind or ungenerous towards her This is well and I now call upon Mr Wood to redeem his pledge to bring forward facts and proofs fully to elucidate the subject to reconcile if he can the extraordinary discrepancies which I have pointed out between his assertions and the actual facts and especially between his account of Mary Prince's character and his own conduct in regard to her He has now to produce such a statement as will acquit him not only in the opinion of Sir Patrick Ross but of the British public And in this position he has spontaneously placed himself in attempting to destroy by his deliberate criminatory letter the poor woman's fair fame and reputation an attempt but for which the present publication would probably never have appeared Here perhaps we might safely leave the case to the judgment of the public but as this negro woman's character not the less valuable to her because her condition is so humble has been so unscrupulously blackened by her late master a party so much interested and inclined to place her in the worst point of view it is incumbent on me as her advocate with the public to state such additional testimony in her behalf as I can fairly and conscientiously adduce My first evidence is Mr Joseph Phillips of Antigua Having submitted to his inspection Mr Wood's letter and Mary Prince's narrative and requested his candid and deliberate sentiments in regard to the actual facts of the case I have been favoured with the following letter from him on the subject London January Dear Sir In giving you my opinion of Mary Prince's narrative and of Mr Wood's letter respecting her addressed to Mr Taylor I shall first mention my opportunities of forming a proper estimate of the conduct and character of both parties I have known Mr Wood since his first arrival in Antigua in He was then a poor young man who had been brought up as a ship carpenter in Bermuda He was afterwards raised to be a clerk in the Commissariat department and realised sufficient capital to commence business as a merchant This last profession he has followed successfully for a good many years and is understood to have accumulated very considerable wealth After he entered into trade I had constant intercourse with him in the way of business and in and I was regularly employed on his premises as his clerk consequently I had opportunities of seeing a good deal of his character both as a merchant and as a master of slaves The former topic I pass over as irrelevant to the present subject in reference to the latter I shall merely observe that he was not in regard to ordinary Page matters more severe probably than the ordinary run of slave owners but if seriously offended he was not of a disposition to be easily appeased and was obstinate in adhering to any resolution he had once taken As regards the exaction of work from domestic slaves his wife was probably more severe than himself it was almost impossible for the slaves ever to give her entire satisfaction Of their slave Molly or Mary I know less than of Mr and Mrs Wood but I saw and heard enough of her both while I was constantly employed on Mr Wood's premises and while I was there occasionally on business to be quite certain that she was viewed by her owners as their most respectable and trust worthy female slave It is within my personal knowledge that she had usually the charge of the house in their absence was entrusted with the keys c and was always considered by the neighbours and visitors as their confidential household servant and as a person in whose integrity they placed unlimited confidence although when Mrs Wood was at home she was no doubt kept pretty closely at washing and other hard work A decided proof of the estimation in which she was held by her owners exists in the fact that Mr Wood uniformly refused to part with her whereas he sold five other slaves while she was with them Indeed she always appeared to me to be a slave of superior intelligence and respectability and I always understood such to be her general character in the place As to what Mr Wood alleges about her being frequently before the police c I can only say I never heard of the circumstance before and as I lived for twenty years in the same small town and in the vicinity of their residence I think I could scarcely have failed to become acquainted with it had such been the fact She might however have been occasionally before the magistrate in consequence of little disputes among the slaves without any serious imputation on her general respectability She says she was twice summoned to appear as a witness on such occasions and that she was once sent by her mistress to be confined in the Cage and was afterwards flogged by her desire This cruel practice is very common in Antigua and in my opinion is but little creditable to the slave owners and magistrates by whom such arbitrary punishments are inflicted frequently for very trifling faults Mr James Scotland is the only magistrate in the colony who invariably refuses to sanction this reprehensible practice Of the immoral conduct ascribed to Molly by Mr Wood I can say nothing further than this that I have heard she had at a former period previous to her marriage a connexion with a white person a Capt which I have no doubt was broken off when she became seriously impressed with religion But at any rate such connexions are so common I might almost say universal in our slave colonies that except by the missionaries and a few serious persons they are considered if faults at all so very venial as scarcely to deserve the name of immorality Mr Wood knows this colonial estimate of such connexions as well as I do and however false such an estimate must be allowed to be especially when applied to their own conduct by persons of education pretending to adhere to the pure Christian rule of morals yet when he ascribes to a negro slave to whom legal marriage was denied such great criminality for laxity of this sort and professes to be so exceedingly shocked and amazed at the tale he himself relates he must I am confident have had a farther object in view than the information of Mr Taylor or Sir Patrick Ross He must it is evident have been aware that his letter would be sent to Mr Allen and accordingly adapted it as more important documents from the colonies are often adapted for effect in England The tale of the slave Molly's immoralities be assured was not intended for Antigua so much as for Stoke Newington and Peckham and Aldermanbury In regard to Mary's narrative generally although I cannot speak to the accuracy of the details except in a few recent particulars I can with safety declare that I see no reason to question the truth of a single fact stated by her or even to suspect her in any instance of intentional exaggeration It bears in my judgment Page the genuine stamp of truth and nature Such is my unhesitating opinion after a residence of twenty seven years in the West Indies To T Pringle Esq I remain c JOSEPH PHILLIPS P S As Mr Wood refers to the evidence of Dr T Coull in opposition to Mary's assertions it may be proper to enable you justly to estimate the worth of that person's evidence in cases connected with the condition and treatment of slaves You are aware that in Mr M'Queen of Glasgow in noticing a Report of the Ladies' Society of Birmingham for the relief of British Negro Slaves asserted with his characteristic audacity that the statement which it contained respecting distressed and deserted slaves in Antigua was an abominable falsehood Not contented with this and with insinuating that I as agent of the society in the distribution of their charity in Antigua had fraudulently duped them out of their money by a fabricated tale of distress Mr M'Queen proceeded to libel me in the most opprobrious terms as a man of the most worthless and abandoned character In elucidation of the circumstances above referred to I subjoin the following extracts from the Report of the Birmingham Ladies' Society for As a portion of the funds of this association has been appropriated to assist the benevolent efforts of a society which has for fifteen years afforded relief to distressed and deserted slaves in Antigua it may not be uninteresting to our friends to learn the manner in which the agent of this society has been treated for simply obeying the command of our Saviour by ministering like the good Samaritan to the distresses of the helpless and the desolate The society's proceedings being adverted to by a friend of Africa at one of the public meetings held in this country a West Indian planter who was present wrote over to his friends in Antigua and represented the conduct of the distributors of this charity in such a light that it was deemed worthy of the cognizance of the House of Assembly Mr Joseph Phillips a resident of the island who had most kindly and disinterestedly exerted himself in the distribution of the money from England among the poor deserted slaves was brought before the Assembly and most severely interrogated on his refusing to deliver up his private correspondence with his friends in England he was thrown into a loathsome jail where he was kept for nearly five months while his loss of business and the oppressive proceedings instituted against him were involving him in poverty and ruin On his discharge by the House of Assembly he was seized in their lobby for debt and again imprisoned In our report for the year we quoted a passage from the th Report of the Society for the relief of deserted Slaves in the island of Antigua in reference to a case of great distress This statement fell into the hands of Mr M'Queen the Editor of the Glasgow Courier Of the consequences resulting from this circumstance we only gained information through the Leicester Chronicle which had copied an article from the Weekly Register of Antigua dated St John's September We find from this that Mr M'Queen affirms that 'with the exception of the fact that the society is as it deserves to be duped out of its money the whole tale' of the distress above referred to 'is an abominable falsehood ' This statement which we are informed has appeared in many of the public papers is COMPLETELY REFUTED in our Appendix No to which we refer our readers Mr M'Queen's statements we regret to say would lead many to believe that there are no deserted Negroes to assist and that the case mentioned was a perfect fabrication He also distinctly avers that the disinterested and humane agent of the society Mr Joseph Phillips is 'a man of the most worthless and abandoned character ' In opposition to this statement we learn the good character of Mr Phillips from those who have long been acquainted with his laudable exertions in the cause of humanity and from the Editor of the Weekly Register of Antigua who speaks on his own knowledge of more than twenty years back confidently appealing at the same time to the inhabitants of the colony in which he resides for the truth of his averments and producing a testimonial to Mr Phillips's good character signed by two members of the Antigua House of Assembly and by Mr Wyke the collector of his Majesty's customs and by Antigua merchants as follows 'that they have been acquainted with him the last four years and upwards and he has always conducted himself in an upright becoming manner his character we know to be unimpeached and his morals unexceptionable ' Signed Thomas Saunderson John D Taylor John A Wood George Wyke Samuel L Darrel Giles S Musson Robert Grant St John's Antigua June In addition to the above testimonies Mr Phillips has brought over to England with him others of a more recent date from some of the most respectable persons in Antigua sufficient to cover with confusion all his unprincipled calumniators See also his account of his own case in the Anti Slavery Reporter No p Now I know from good authority that Page it was upon Dr Coull's information that Mr M'Queen founded this impudent contradiction of notorious facts and this audacious libel of my personal character From this single circumstance you may judge of the value of his evidence in the case of Mary Prince I can furnish further information respecting Dr Coull's colonial proceedings both private and judicial should circumstances require it J P I leave the preceding letter to be candidly weighed by the reader in opposition to the inculpatory allegations of Mr Wood merely remarking that Mr Wood will find it somewhat difficult to impugn the evidence of Mr Phillips whose upright unimpeached and unexceptionable character he has himself vouched for in unqualified terms by affixing his signature to the testimonial published in the Weekly Register of Antigua in See Note below The next testimony in Mary's behalf is that of Mrs Forsyth a lady in whose service she spent the summer of See page This lady on leaving London to join her husband voluntarily presented Mary with a certificate which though it relates only to a recent and short period of her history is a strong corroboration of the habitual respectability of her character It is in the following terms Mrs Forsyth states that the bearer of this paper Mary James has been with her for the last six months that she has found her an excellent character being honest industrious and sober and that she parts with her on no other account than this that being obliged to travel with her husband who has lately come from abroad in bad health she has no farther need of a servant Any person wishing to engage her can have her character in full from Miss Robson Keppel Street Russel Square whom Mrs Forsyth has requested to furnish particulars to any one desiring them Keppel Street th Sept In the last place I add my own testimony in behalf of this negro woman Independently of the scrutiny which as Secretary of the Anti Slavery Society I made into her case when she first applied for assistance at Aldermanbury and the watchful eye I kept upon her conduct for the ensuing twelvemonths while she was the occasional pensioner of the Society I have now had the opportunity of closely observing her conduct for fourteen months in the situation of a domestic Page servant in my own family and the following is the deliberate opinion of Mary's character formed not only by myself but also by my wife and sister in law after this ample period of observation We have found her perfectly honest and trustworthy in all respects so that we have no hesitation in leaving every thing in the house at her disposal She had the entire charge of the house during our absence in Scotland for three months last autumn and conducted herself in that charge with the utmost discretion and fidelity She is not it is true a very expert housemaid nor capable of much hard work for her constitution appears to be a good deal broken but she is careful industrious and anxious to do her duty and to give satisfaction She is capable of strong attachments and feels deep though unobtrusive gratitude for real kindness shown her She possesses considerable natural sense and has much quickness of observation and discrimination of character She is remarkable for decency and propriety of conduct and her delicacy even in trifling minuti has been a trait of special remark by the females of my family This trait which is obviously quite unaffected would be a most inexplicable anomaly if her former habits had been so indecent and depraved as Mr Wood alleges Her chief faults so far as we have discovered them are a somewhat violent and hasty temper and a considerable share of natural pride and self importance but these defects have been but rarely and transiently manifested and have scarcely occasioned an hour's uneasiness at any time in our household Her religious knowledge notwithstanding the pious care of her Moravian instructors in Antigua is still but very limited and her views of christianity indistinct but her profession whatever it may have of imperfection I am convinced has nothing of insincerity In short we consider her on the whole as respectable and well behaved a person in her station as any domestic white or black and we have had ample experience of both colours that we have ever had in our service But after all Mary's character important though its exculpation be to her is not really the point of chief practical interest in this case Suppose all Mr Wood's defamatory allegations to be true suppose him to be able to rake up against her out of the records of the Antigua police or from the veracious testimony of his brother colonists twenty stories as bad or worse than what he insinuates suppose the whole of her own statement to be false and even the whole of her conduct since she came under our observation here to be a tissue of hypocrisy suppose all this and leave the negro woman as black in character as in complexion If it even were so how strong a plea of palliation might not the poor negro bring by adducing the neglect of her various owners to afford religious instruction or moral discipline and the habitual influence of their evil example to say the very least before her eyes What moral good could she possibly learn what moral evil could she easily escape while under the uncontrolled power of such masters as she describes Captain I and Mr D of Turk's Island All things considered it is indeed wonderful to find her such as she now is But as she has herself piously expressed it that God whom then she knew not mercifully preserved her for better things yet it would affect not the main facts which are these I Mr Wood not daring in England to punish this woman arbitrarily as he would have done in the West Indies drove her out of his house or Page left her at least only the alternative of returning instantly to Antigua with the certainty of severe treatment there or submitting in silence to what she considered intolerable usage in his household He has since obstinately persisted in refusing her manumission to enable her to return home in security though repeatedly offered more than ample compensation for her value as a slave and this on various frivolous pretexts but really and indeed not unavowedly in order to punish her for leaving his service in England though he himself had professed to give her that option These unquestionable facts speak volumes After the preceding pages were printed I was favoured with a communication from the Rev J Curtin to whom among other acquaintances of Mr Wood's in this country the entire proof sheets of this pamphlet had been sent for inspection Mr Curtin in reference to Mary Prince's narrative as it regards himself see page states That sometime before her baptism on her being admitted a catechumen preparatory to that holy ordinance she brought a note from her owner Mr Wood recommending her for religious instruction c That it was his usual practice when any adult slaves came on week days to school to require their owners' permission for their attendance but that on Sundays the chapel was open indiscriminately to all Mary however after a personal interview with Mr Curtin and after hearing his letter read by me still maintains that Mr Wood's note recommended her for baptism merely and that she never received any religious instruction whatever from Mr and Mrs Wood or from any one else at that period beyond what she has stated in her narrative In regard to her non admission to the Sunday school without permission from her owners she admits that she may possibly have mistaken the clergyman's meaning on that point but says that such was certainly her impression at the time and the actual cause of her non attendance Mr Curtin finds in his books some reference to Mary's connection with a Captain the individual I believe alluded to by Mr Phillips at page but he states that when she attended his chapel she was always decently and becomingly dressed and appeared to him to be in a situation of trust in her mistress's family Mr Curtin offers no comment on any other part of Mary's statement but he speaks in very favourable though general terms of the respectability of Mr Wood whom he had known for many years in Antigua and of Mrs Wood though she was not personally known to him he says that he had heard her spoken of by those of her acquaintance as a lady of very mild and amiable manners Another friend of Mr and Mrs Wood a lady who had been their guest both in Antigua and England alleges that Mary has grossly misrepresented them in her narrative and says that she can vouch for their being the most benevolent kind hearted people that can possibly live She has declined however to furnish me with any written correction of the misrepresentations she complains of although I offered to insert her testimony in behalf of her friends if sent to me in time And having already kept back the publication a fortnight waiting for communications of this sort I will not delay it longer Those who have withheld their strictures have only themselves to blame Of the general character of Mr and Mrs Wood I would not designedly give any unfair impression Without implicitly adopting either the view of Mary Prince or the unmeasured encomiums of their West India partizans I am willing to believe them to be on the whole fair specimens of colonial character Let them even be rated if their friends will have it so in the most respectable class of slaveholders and laying every thing else entirely out of view let Mr Wood's conduct in this affair be tried exclusively by the facts established beyond dispute and by his own statement of the case in his letter to Mr Taylor But then I ask if the very best and mildest of your slave owners can act as Mr Wood is proved to have acted what is to be expected of persons whose mildness or equity or common humanity no one will dare to vouch for If such things are done in the green tree what will be done in the dry And what else then can Colonial Slavery possibly be even in its best estate but a system incurably evil and iniquitous I require no other data I need add no further comment Page The case affords a most instructive illustration of the true spirit of the slave system and of the pretensions of the slaveholders to assert not merely their claims to a vested right in the labour of their bondmen but to an indefeasible property in them as their absolute chattels It furnishes a striking practical comment on the assertions of the West Indians that self interest is a sufficient check to the indulgence of vindictive feelings in the master for here is a case where a man a respectable and benevolent man as his friends aver prefers losing entirely the full price of the slave for the mere satisfaction of preventing a poor black woman from returning home to her husband If the pleasure of thwarting the benevolent wishes of the Anti Slavery Society in behalf of the deserted negro be an additional motive with Mr Wood it will not much mend his wretched plea I may here add a few words respecting the earlier portion of Mary Prince's narrative The facts there stated must necessarily rest entirely since we have no collateral evidence upon their intrinsic claims to probability and upon the reliance the reader may feel disposed after perusing the foregoing pages to place on her veracity To my judgment the internal evidence of the truth of her narrative appears remarkably strong The circumstances are related in a tone of natural sincerity and are accompanied in almost every case with characteristic and minute details which must I conceive carry with them full conviction to every candid mind that this negro woman has actually seen felt and suffered all that she so impressively describes and that the picture she has given of West Indian slavery is not less true than it is revolting But there may be some persons into whose hands this tract may fall so imperfectly acquainted with the real character of Negro Slavery as to be shocked into partial if not absolute incredulity by the acts of inhuman oppression and brutality related of Capt I and his wife and of Mr D the salt manufacturer of Turk's Island Here at least such persons may be disposed to think there surely must be some exaggeration the facts are too shocking to be credible The facts are indeed shocking but unhappily not the less credible on that account Slavery is a curse to the oppressor scarcely less than to the oppressed its natural tendency is to brutalize both After a residence myself of six years in a slave colony I am inclined to doubt whether as regards its demoralizing influence the master is not even a greater object of compassion than his bondman Let those who are disposed to doubt the atrocities related in this narrative on the testimony of a sufferer examine the details of many cases of similar barbarity that have lately come before the public on unquestionable evidence Passing over the reports of the Fiscal of Berbice See Anti Slavery Reporter Nos and and the Mauritius horrors recently unveiled Ibid No let them consider the case of Mr and Mrs Moss of the Bahamas and their slave Kate so justly denounced by the Secretary for the Colonies Ibid No the cases of Eleanor Mead Ibid No p No p of Henry Williams Ibid No p No p and No and Page of the Rev Mr Bridges and Kitty Hylton Anti Slavery Reporter Nos and in Jamaica These cases alone might suffice to demonstrate the inevitable tendency of slavery as it exists in our colonies to brutalize the master to a truly frightful degree a degree which would often cast into the shade even the atrocities related in the narrative of Mary Prince and which are sufficient to prove independently of all other evidence that there is nothing in the revolting character of the facts to affect their credibility but that on the contrary similar deeds are at this very time of frequent occurrence in almost every one of our slave colonies The system of coercive labour may vary in different places it may be more destructive to human life in the cane culture of Mauritius and Jamaica than in the predial and domestic bondage of Bermuda or the Bahamas but the spirit and character of slavery are every where the same and cannot fail to produce similar effects Wherever slavery prevails there will inevitably be found cruelty and oppression Individuals who have preserved humane and amiable and tolerant dispositions towards their black dependents may doubtless be found among slave holders but even where a happy instance of this sort occurs such as Mary's first mistress the kind hearted Mrs Williams the favoured condition of the slave is still as precarious as it is rare it is every moment at the mercy of events and must always be held by a tenure so proverbially uncertain as that of human prosperity or human life Such examples like a feeble and flickering streak of light in a gloomy picture only serve by contrast to exhibit the depth of the prevailing shades Like other exceptions they only prove the general rule the unquestionable tendency of the system is to vitiate the best tempers and to harden the most feeling hearts Never be kind nor speak kindly to a slave said an accomplished English lady in South Africa to my wife I have now she added been for some time a slave owner and have found from vexatious experience in my own household that nothing but harshness and hauteur will do with slaves I might perhaps not inappropriately illustrate this point more fully by stating many cases which fell under my own personal observation or became known to me through authentic sources at the Cape of Good Hope a colony where slavery assumes as it is averred a milder aspect than in any other dependency of the empire where it exists and I could shew from the judicial records of that colony received by me within these few weeks cases scarcely inferior in barbarity to the worst of those to which I have just specially referred but to do so would lead me too far from the immediate purpose of this pamphlet and extend it to an inconvenient length I shall therefore content myself with quoting a single short passage from the excellent work of my friend Dr Walsh entitled Notices of Brazil a work which besides its other merits has vividly illustrated the true spirit of Negro Slavery as it displays itself not merely in that country but wherever it has been permitted to open its Pandora's box of misery and crime Let the reader ponder on the following just remarks and compare the facts stated by the Author in illustration of them with the circumstances related at pages and of Mary's narrative Page If then we put out of the question the injury inflicted on others and merely consider the deterioration of feeling and principle with which it operates on ourselves ought it not to be a sufficient and indeed unanswerable argument against the permission of Slavery The exemplary manner in which the paternal duties are performed at home may mark people as the most fond and affectionate parents but let them once go abroad and come within the contagion of slavery and it seems to alter the very nature of a man and the father has sold and still sells the mother and his children with as little compunction as he would a sow and her litter of pigs and he often disposes of them together This deterioration of feeling is conspicuous in many ways among the Brazilians They are naturally a people of a humane and good natured disposition and much indisposed to cruelty or severity of any kind Indeed the manner in which many of them treat their slaves is a proof of this as it is really gentle and considerate but the natural tendency to cruelty and oppression in the human heart is continually evolved by the impunity and uncontrolled licence in which they are exercised I never walked through the streets of Rio that some house did not present to me the semblance of a bridewell where the moans and the cries of the sufferers and the sounds of whips and scourges within announced to me that corporal punishment was being inflicted Whenever I remarked this to a friend I was always answered that the refractory nature of the slave rendered it necessary and no house could properly be conducted unless it was practised But this is certainly not the case and the chastisement is constantly applied in the very wantonness of barbarity and would not and dared not be inflicted on the humblest wretch in society if he was not a slave and so put out of the pale of pity Immediately joining our house was one occupied by a mechanic from which the most dismal cries and moans constantly proceeded I entered the shop one day and found it was occupied by a saddler who had two negro boys working at his business He was a tawny cadaverous looking man with a dark aspect and he had cut from his leather a scourge like a Russian knout which he held in his hand and was in the act of exercising on one of the naked children in an inner room and this was the cause of the moans and cries we heard every day and almost all day long In the rear of our house was another occupied by some women of bad character who kept as usual several negro slaves I was awoke early one morning by dismal cries and looking out of the window I saw in the back yard of the house a black girl of about fourteen years old before her stood her mistress a white woman with a large stick in her hand She was undressed except her petticoat and chemise which had fallen down and left her shoulders and bosom bare Her hair was streaming behind and every fierce and malevolent passion was depicted in her face She too like my hostess at Governo another striking illustration of the dehumanizing effects of Slavery was the very representation of a fury She was striking the poor girl whom she had driven up into a corner where she was on her knees appealing for mercy She shewed her none but continued to strike her on the head and thrust the stick into her face till she was herself exhausted and her poor victim covered with blood This scene was renewed every morning and the cries and moans of the poor suffering blacks announced that they were enduring the penalty of slavery in being the objects on which the irritable and malevolent passions of the whites are allowed to vent themselves with impunity nor could I help deeply deploring that state of society in which the vilest characters in the community are allowed an almost uncontrolled power of life and death over their innocent and far more estimable fellow creatures Notices of Brazil vol ii p Page In conclusion I may observe that the history of Mary Prince furnishes a corollary to Lord Stowell's decision in the case of the slave Grace and that it is most valuable on this account Whatever opinions may be held by some readers on the grave question of immediately abolishing Colonial Slavery nothing assuredly can be more repugnant to the feelings of Englishmen than that the system should be permitted to extend its baneful influence to this country Yet such is the case when the slave landed in England still only possesses that qualified degree of freedom that a change of domicile will determine it Though born a British subject and resident within the shores of England he is cut off from his dearest natural rights by the sad alternative of regaining them at the expence of liberty and the certainty of severe treatment It is true that he has the option of returning but it is a cruel mockery to call it a voluntary choice when upon his return depend his means of subsistence and his re union with all that makes life valuable Here he has tasted the sweets of freedom to quote the words of the unfortunate Mary Prince but if he desires to restore himself to his family or to escape from suffering and destitution and the other evils of a climate uncongenial to his constitution and habits he must abandon the enjoyment of his late acquired liberty and again subject himself to the arbitrary power of a vindictive master The case of Mary Prince is by no means a singular one many of the same kind are daily occurring and even if the case were singular it would still loudly call for the interference of the legislature In instances of this kind no injury can possibly be done to the owner by confirming to the slave his resumption of his natural rights It is the master's spontaneous act to bring him to this country he knows when he brings him that he divests himself of his property and it is in fact a minor species of slave trading when he has thus enfranchised his slave to re capture that slave by the necessities of his condition or by working upon the better feelings of his heart Abstractedly from all legal technicalities there is no real difference between thus compelling the return of the enfranchised negro and trepanning a free native of England by delusive hopes into perpetual slavery The most ingenious casuist could not point out any essential distinction between the two cases Our boasted liberty is the dream of imagination and no longer the characteristic of our country if its bulwarks can thus be thrown down by colonial special pleading It would well become the character of the present Government to introduce a Bill into the Legislature making perpetual that freedom which the slave has acquired by his passage here and thus to declare in the most ample sense of the words what indeed we had long fondly believed to be the fact though it now appears that we have been mistaken THAT NO SLAVE CAN EXIST WITHIN THE SHORES OF GREAT BRITAIN Page APPENDIX As inquiries have been made from various quarters respecting the existence of marks of severe punishment on Mary Prince's body it seems proper to append to this Edition the following letter on that subject written by Mrs Pringle to Mrs Townsend one of the benevolent Secretaries of the Birmingham Ladies' Society for Relief of Negro Slaves London Solly Terrace Claremont Square March Dear Madam My husband having read to me the passage in your last letter to him expressing a desire to be furnished with some description of the marks of former ill usage on Mary Prince's person I beg in reply to state that the whole of the back part of her body is distinctly scarred and as it were chequered with the vestiges of severe floggings Besides this there are many large scars on other parts of her person exhibiting an appearance as if the flesh had been deeply cut or lacerated with gashes by some instrument wielded by most unmerciful hands Mary affirms that all these scars were occasioned by the various cruel punishments she has mentioned or referred to in her narrative and of the entire truth of this statement I have no hesitation in declaring myself perfectly satisfied not only from my dependence on her uniform veracity but also from my previous observation of similar cases at the Cape of Good Hope In order to put you in possession of such full and authentic evidence respecting the marks on Mary Prince's person as may serve your benevolent purpose in making the inquiry I beg to add to my own testimony that of Miss Strickland the lady who wrote down in this house the narratives of Mary Prince and Ashton Warner together with the testimonies of my sister Susan and my friend Miss Martha Browne all of whom were present and assisted me this day in a second inspection of Mary's body I remain Dear Madam Yours very truly M PRINGLE The above statement is certified and corroborated by SUSANNA STRICKLAND SUSAN BROWN MARTHA A BROWNE To Mrs Townsend West

Moses-Grandy,NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE F MOSES GRANDY LATE A SLAVE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Slavery is a mass a system of enormities which incontrovertably bids defiance to every regulation which ingenuity can devise or power effect but a Total Extinction Why ought slavery be abolished Because it is incurable injustice Why is injustice to remain for a single hour William Pitt PUBLISHED AND SOLD FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS RELATIONS STILL IN SLAVERY LONDON C GILPIN BISHOPS GATE STREET It is not improbable that some of the proper names in the following s are incorrectly spelled M G owing to the laws of the slave states being perfectly illiterate his pronunciation is the only guide DUBLIN PRINTED BY WEBB AND CHAPMAN GREAT BRUNSWICK ST iii INTRODUCTION ABOUT a fortnight ago the subject of the following brief Memoir came to me bearing with him a letter from a dear friend and distinguished abolitionist in the United States from which the following is an extract I seize my pen in haste to gratify a most worthy coloured friend of mine by giving him a letter of introduction to you as he intends sailing this week August th for Liverpool and London via New Orleans His name is Moses Grandy He knows what it is to have been a slave and what are the tender mercies of the southern slave drivers His history is not only authentic but most extraordinary and full of thrilling iv interest Could it published it would make a deep sensation in every quarter He was compelled to buy his freedom three times over He paid for it dollars nearly sterling He has since bought his wife and one or two of his children and before going to England will first go to New Orleans to purchase some of his other children if he can find them who are still held in captivity His benevolence affection kindness of heart and elasticity of spirit are truly remarkable He has a good head a fine countenance and a great spirit notwithstanding his education has been obtained in the horrible school of slavery Just get him to tell you his narrative and if you happen to have an Anti slavery Meeting let him tell his tale to a British audience In the letter of another highly esteemed friend he is spoken of as unsurpassed for faithfulness and perseverance In the letter v of a third as a worthy and respectable man On examining a book containing a list of the donations made him by American friends in aid of his noble design to rescue from the miseries of slavery his relations I found the names and certificates of persons of the highest respectability It will be amply sufficient with those who are acquainted with the abolitionists of the United States for me to name General Fessenden and Nathan Winslow Esq of Portland Maine the Rev A A Phelps Ellis Gray Loring and Samuel E Sewall Esqs of Boston Massachusetts Being satisfied by these indubitable vouchers of Moses Grandy's title to credit I listened to his artless tale with entire confidence and with a feeling of interest which all will participate who peruse the following s Considering his Narrative calculated to promote a more extensive knowledge of the workings of American slavery and that its vi sale might contribute to the object which engages so entirely the mind of Moses namely the redemption of those who are in bonds belonging to his family I resolved to commit it to the press as nearly as possible in the language of Moses himself I have carefully abstained from casting in a single reflection or animadversion of my own I leave the touching story of the self liberated captive to speak for itself and the wish of my heart will be gratified and my humble effort on his behalf be richly rewarded if this little book be the means of obtaining for my coloured brother the assistance which he seeks or of increasing the zeal of those who are associated for the purpose of breaking every yoke and setting the oppressed free GEORGE THOMPSON Blandford place Regent's park October th LIFE OF MOSES GRANDY MY name is Moses Grandy I was born in Camden County North Carolina I believe I am fifty six years old Slaves seldom know exactly how old they are neither they nor their masters set down the time of a birth the slaves because they are not allowed to write or read and the masters because they only care to know what slaves belong to them The master Billy Grandy whose slave I was born was a hard drinking man he sold away many slaves I remember four sisters and four brothers my mother had more children but they were dead or sold away before I can remember I was the youngest I remember well my mother often hid us all in the woods to prevent master selling us When we wanted water she sought for it in any hole or puddle formed by falling trees or otherwise it was often full of tadpoles and insects she strained it and gave it round to each of us in the hollow of her hand For food she gathered berries in the woods got potatoes raw corn c After a time the master would send word to her to come in promising he would not sell us But at length persons came who agreed to give the prices he set on us His wife with much to be done prevailed on him not to sell me but he sold my brother who was a little boy My mother frantic with grief resisted their taking her child away she was beaten and held down she fainted and when she came to herself her boy was gone She made much outcry for which the master tied her up to a peach tree in the yard and flogged her Another of my brothers was sold to Mr Tyler Dewan's Neck Pasquotank County this man very much ill treated many coloured boys One very cold day he sent my brother out naked and hungry to find a yoke of steers the boy returned without finding them when his master flogged him and sent him out again a white lady who lived near gave him food and advised him to try again he did so but it seems again without success He piled up a heap of leaves and laid himself down in them and died there He was found through a flock of turkey buzzards hovering over him these birds had pulled his eyes out My young master and I used to play together there was but two days' difference in our ages My old master always said he would give me to him When he died all the coloured people were divided amongst his children and I fell to young master his name was James Grandy I was then about eight years old When I became old enough to be taken away from my mother and put to field work I was hired out for the year by auction at the Court House every January this is the common practice with respect to slaves belonging to persons who are under age This continued till my master and myself were twenty one years old The first who hired me was Mr Kemp who used me pretty Well he gave me plenty to eat and sufficient clothing The next was old Jemmy Coates a severe man Because I could not learn his way of hilling corn he flogged me naked with a severe whip made of a very tough sapling this lapped round me at each stroke the point of it at last entered my belly and broke off leaving an inch and a half outside I was not aware of it until on going to work again it hurt my side very much when on looking down I saw it sticking out of my body I pulled it out and the blood spouted after it The wound festered and discharged very much at the time and hurt me for years after In being hired out sometimes the slave gets a good home and sometimes a bad one when he gets a good one he dreads to see January come when he has a bad one the year seems five times as long as it is I was next with Mr Enoch Sawyer of Camden county my business was to keep ferry and do other odd work It was cruel living we had not near enough of either victuals or clothes I was half starved for half my time I have often ground the husks of Indian corn over again in a hand mill for the chance of getting something to eat out of it which the former grinding had left In severe frosts I was compelled to go into the fields and woods to work with my naked feet cracked and bleeding from extreme cold to warm them I used to rouse an ox or hog and stand on the place where it had lain I was at that place three years and very long years they seemed to me The trick by which he kept me so long was this the Court House was but a mile off on hiring day he prevented me from going till he went himself and bid for me On the last occasion he was detained for a little while by other business so I ran as quickly as I could and got hired before he came up Mr George Furley was my next master he employed me as a car boy in the Dismal swamp I had to drive lumber I had plenty to eat and plenty of clothes I was so overjoyed at the change that I then thought I would not have left the place to go to heaven Next year I was hired by Mr John Micheau of the same county who married my young mistress one of the daughters of Mr Grandy and sister to my present owner This master gave us very few clothes and but little to eat I was almost naked One day he came into the field and asked why no more work was done The older people were afraid of him so I said that the reason was we were so hungry we could not work He went home and told the mistress to give us plenty to eat and at dinner time we had plenty We came out shouting for joy and went to work with delight From that time we had food enough and he soon found that he had a great deal more work done The field was quite alive with the people striving who should do most He hired me for another year He was a great gambler He kept me up five nights together without sleep night or day to wait on the gambling table I was standing in the corner of the room nodding for want of sleep when he took up the shovel and beat me with it he dislocated my shoulder and sprained my wrist and broke the shovel over me I ran away and got another person to hire me This person was Mr Richard Furley who after that hired me at the Court House every year till my master came of age He gave me a pass to work for myself so I obtained work by the piece where I could and paid him out of my earnings what we had agreed on I maintained myself on the rest and saved what I could In this way I was not liable to be flogged and ill used He paid seventy eighty or ninety dollars a year for me and I paid him twenty or thirty dollars a year more than that When my master came of age he took all his coloured people to himself Seeing that I was industrious and persevering and had obtained plenty of work he made me pay him almost twice as much as I had paid Mr Furley At that time the English blockaded the Chesapeake which made it necessary to send merchandize from Norfolk to Elizabeth city by the Grand Canal so that it might get to sea by Pamlico Sound and Ocracock Inlet I took some canal boats on shares Mr Grice who married my other young mistress was the owner of them I gave him one half of all I received for freight out of the other half I had to victual and man the boats and all over that expense was my own profit Some time before this my brother Benjamin returned from the West Indies where he had been two years with his master's vessel I was very glad to hear of it and got leave to go see him While I was sitting with his wife and him his wife's master came and asked him to fetch a can of water he did so and carried it into the store While I was waiting for him and wondering at his being so long away I heard the heavy blows of a hammer after a little while I was alarmed and went to see what was going on I looked into the store and saw my brother lying on his back on the floor and Mr Williams who had bought him driving staples over his wrists and ankles an iron bar was afterwards put across his breast which was also held down by staples I asked what he had been doing and was told that he had done nothing amiss but that his master had failed and he was sold towards paying the debts He lay in that state all that night next day he was taken to jail and I never saw him again This is the usual treatment under such circumstances I had to go by my mother's next morning but I feared to tell her what had happened to my brother I got a boy to go and tell her She was blind and very old and was living in a little hut in the woods after the usual manner of old worn out slaves she was unable to go to my brother before he was taken away and grieved after him greatly It was some time after this that I married a slave belonging to Mr Enoch Sawyer who had been so hard a master to me I left her at home that is at his house one Thursday morning when we had been married about eight months She was well and seemed likely to be so we were nicely getting together our little necessaries On the Friday as I was at work as usual with the boats I heard a noise behind me on the road which ran by the side of the canal I turned to look and saw a gang of slaves coming When they came up to me one of them cried out Moses my dear I wondered who among them should know me and found it was my wife She cried out to me I am gone I was struck with consternation Mr Rogerson was with them on his horse armed with pistols I said to him for God's sake have you bought my wife He said he had when I asked him what she had done he said she had done nothing but that her master wanted money He drew out a pistol and said that if I went near the waggon on which she was he would shoot me I asked for leave to shake hands with her which he refused but said I might stand at a distance and talk with her My heart was so full that I could say very little I asked leave to give her a dram he told Mr Burgess the man who was with him to get down and carry it to her I gave her the little money I had in my pocket and bid her farewell I have never seen or heard of her from that day to this I loved her as I loved my life Mr Grice found that I served him faithfully He and my young mistress his wife advised me as I was getting money fast to try to buy myself By their advice I asked my master what he would take for me He wanted dollars and when I said that was too much he replied he could get for me any minute Mr Grice afterwards went with me to him he said to him that I had already been more profitable to him than any five others of his negroes and reminded him that we had been playfellows in this way he got him to consent to take dollars for me I then went heartily to work and whenever I paid him for my time I paid him something also towards my freedom for which he gave me receipts When I made him the last payment of the dollars for my freedom he tore up all the receipts I told him he ought not to have done so he replied it did not signify for as soon as court day came he should give me my free papers On Monday in court week I went to him he was playing at billiards and would not go with me but told me to come again the next day the next day he did the same and so on daily I went to his sister Mrs Grice and told her I feared that he did not mean to give them to me she said she feared so too and sent for him He was a very wicked young man he came and cursed her and went out of the house Mr Grice was from home on his return he went to my master and told him he ought to give me my free papers that I had paid for myself and it was court week so that there was no excuse He promised he would instead of which he rode away and kept away till court was over Before the next court came he sold me to Mr Trewitt for dollars The way in which Mr Trewitt came to buy me was this I had left the boats and had gone with a schooner collecting lumber in Albemarle Sound for the merchants Coming to Elizabeth City I found a new store had been opened by Mr Grice which Mr Sutton was keeping the latter gentleman was glad to see me and was desirous that I should return to my old employment with the canal boats as lumber was in great demand at Norfolk I did so and sold some cargoes to Mr Moses Myers of Norfolk As I was waiting at the door of his store for settlement he came up with Mr Trewitt whom I did not then know Mr Myers said to Mr Trewitt here is a captain doing business for you Mr Trewitt then asked me who had chartered the boats and to whom I belonged I told him Mr Sutton had chartered me and that I had belonged to Mr James Grandy but had bought myself He said he would buy me on which Mr Myers told him he could not as I had already bought myself and further said I was one of their old war captains and had never lost a single thing of the property entrusted to me Mr Trewitt said he would buy me and would see about it as soon as he got to Elizabeth City I thought no more about it On my return voyage I delivered a cargo at Elizabeth City for Mr Trewitt I had been at Mr Grice's the owner of the boats and on my going away from him to meet Mr Trewitt for settlement he said he would go with me as he wanted money Opposite the Custom House we met Mr Trewitt who said Well captain I have bought you Mr Grice said Let us have no nonsense go and settle with him Angry words passed between them one saying he had bought me and the other denying that he had or could as I had bought myself already We all went to Mr Grice's dwelling house there Mr Trewitt settled with me about the freight and then jumping up said Now I will show you Mr Grice whether I am a liar or not He fetched the bill of sale on reading it Mr Grice's colour changed and he sent for Mrs Grice When she read it she began to cry seeing that I began to cry too She sent me to her brother who was at Mr Wood's boarding house He was playing at billiards I said to him Master James have you sold me He said No I said he had when he turned round and went into another room crying I followed him All the gentlemen followed us saying Captain Grandy what is the matter I told them Master James had sold me again They asked him why he had done it he said it was because people had jeered him by saying I had more sense than he had They would not suffer him to remain in the boarding house but turned him out there and then with all his trunks and boxes Mrs Grice his sister sued him in my name for my liberty but he gained the cause the court maintained that I and all I could do belonged to him and that he had a right to do as he pleased with me and all my earnings as his own property until he had taken me to the Court House and given me my free papers and until besides that I had been a year and a day in the Northern States to gain my residence So I was forced to go to Mr Trewitt He agreed that if I would pay him the same wages as I paid my late master and the dollars he gave for me he would give me my free papers He bought two canal boats and taking me out of Mr Grice's employment set me to work them on the same terms as I did for my former master I was two years and a half in earning the dollars to pay for myself the second time Just when I had completed the payment he failed Oh Christmas eve he gave me a letter to take to Mr Mews at Newbegun Creek I was rather unwilling to take it wishing to go to my wife I told him too I was going to his office to settle with him He offered to give me two dollars to take the letter and said he would settle when I came back then Mr Shaw came from another room and said his vessel was ready loaded but he had nobody he could trust with his goods he offered me five dollars to take the vessel down and deliver the goods to Mr Knox who also was at Newbegun Creek The wind was fair and the hands on board so I agreed it being Christmas eve I was glad of something to carry to my wife I ran the vessel down to the mouth of the Creek and anchored when the moon rose I went up the river I reached the wharf and commenced taking out the goods that night and delivered them all safely to Mr Knox next morning I then took the letter to Mr Mews who read it and looking up at me said Well you belong to me I thought he was joking and said How What way He said Don't you recollect when Trewitt chartered Wilson Sawyer's brig to the West Indies I said I did He told me Trewitt then came to him to borrow dollars which he would not lend except he had a mortgage on me Trewitt was to take it up at a certain time but never did I asked him whether he really took the mortgage on me He replied that he certainly thought Trewitt would have taken up the mortgage but he had failed and was not worth a cent and he Mews must have his money I asked him whether he had not helped me and my young mistress in the Court House when Master James fooled me before He said he did help me all he could and that he should not have taken a mortgage on me but that he thought Trewitt would take it up Trewitt must have received some of the last payments from me after he had given the mortgage and knew he should fail for the mortgage was given two months before this time My head seemed to turn round and round I was quite out of my senses I went away towards the woods Mr Mews sent his waiter after me to persuade me to go back at first I refused but afterwards went He told me he would give me another chance to buy myself and I certainly should have my freedom this time He said Mr Enoch Sawyer wanted to buy me to be his overseer in the Swamp I replied I would never try again to buy myself and that they had already got dollars from me My wife this was my second It will be observed that the narrator married a second wife without having heard of the decease of the first To explain this fact it is necessary to state that the frequent occurrence of cases where husbands and wives members of Christian societies were finally separated by sale led the ministers some years ago to deliberate on the subject they decided that such a separation might be considered as the death of the parties to each other and they therefore agreed to consider subsequent marriages not immoral The practice is general It is scarcely necessary to remark that a more unequivocal and impressive proof of the heinous nature of the system could hardly exist It breaks up the fondest connexions it tears up the holiest attachments and induces the ministers of religion as much as in them lies to garble the divine law to suit its own infernal exigencies wife belonged to Mr Sawyer he told me that her master would not allow me to go to see her if I would not consent to what he now preposed for any coloured person going on the grounds of a white man after being warned of is liable to be flogged or even shot I thus found myself forced to go although no coloured man wishes to live at the house where his wife lives for he has to endure the continual misery of seeing her flogged and abused without daring to say a word in her defence In the service of Mr Sawyer I got into a fair way of buying myself again for I undertook the lightering of the shingles or boards out of the Dismal Swamp and hired hands to assist me But my master had become security for his two sons in law at Norfolk who failed in consequence of which he sold eighteen coloured people his share of the Swamp and two plantations I was one of the slaves he kept and after that had to work in the corn field the same as the rest The overseer was a bad one his name was Brooks The horn was blown at sunrise the coloured people had then to march before the overseer to the field He on horseback We had to work even in long summer days till twelve o'clock before we tasted a morsel men women and children all being served alike At noon the cart appeared with our breakfast It was in large trays and was set on the ground There was bread of which a piece was cut off for each person then there was small hominy boiled that is Indian corn ground in the hand mill and besides this two herrings for each of the men and women and one for each of the children Our drink was the water in the ditches whatever might be its state if the ditches were dry water was brought to us by boys The salt fish made us always thirsty but no other drink than water was ever allowed However thirsty a slave may be he is not allowed to leave his employment for a moment to get water he can only have it when the hands in working have reached the ditch at the end of the rows The overseer stood with his watch in his hand to give us just an hour when he said rise we had to rise and go to work again The women who had children laid them down by the hedge row and gave them straws and other trifles to play with here they were in danger from snakes I have seen a large snake found coiled round the neck and face of a child when its mother went to suckle it at dinner time The hands work in a line by the side of each other the overseer puts the swiftest hands in the fore row and all must keep up with them One black man is kept on purpose to whip the others in the field if he does not flog with sufficient severity he is flogged himself he whips severely to keep the whip from his own back If a man has a wife in the same field with himself he chooses a row by the side of hers that with extreme labour he may if possible help her But he will not be in the same field if he can help it for with his hardest labour he often cannot save her from being flogged and he is obliged to stand by and see it he is always liable to see her taken home at night stripped naked and whipped before all the men On the estate I am speaking of those women who had sucking children suffered much from their breasts becoming full of milk the infants being left at home they therefore could not keep up with the other hands I seen the overseer beat them with raw hide so that blood and milk flew mingled from their breasts A woman who gives offence in the field and is large in the family way is compelled to lie down over a hole made to receive her and is then flogged with the whip or beaten with a paddle which has holes in it at every hole comes a blister One of my sisters was so severely punished in this way that labour was brought on and the child was born in the field This very overseer Mr Brooks killed in this manner a girl named Mary her father and mother were in the field at the time He also killed a boy about twelve years old He had no punishment or even trial for either There was no dinner till dark when he gave the order to knock off and go home The meal then was the same as in the morning except that we had meat twice a week On very few estates are the coloured people provided with any bedding the best masters give only a blanket this master gave none A board which the slave might pick up anywhere on the estate was all he had to lie on If he wished to procure bedding he could only do so by working at nights For warmth therefore the negroes generally sleep near a large fire whether in the kitchen or in their log huts their legs are often in this way blistered and greatly swelled and sometimes badly burnt they suffer severely from this cause When the water mill did not supply meal enough we had to grind with the hand mill The night was employed in this work without any thing being taken from the labour of the day We had to take turn at it women as well as men enough was to be ground to serve for the following day I was eight months in the field My master Mr Sawyer agreed to allow me eight dollars a month while so employed towards buying myself it will be seen he did not give me even that When I first went to work in the corn field I had paid him dollars towards this third buying of my freedom I told him one night I could not stand his field work any longer he asked why I said I was almost starved to death and had long been unaccustomed to this severe labour He wanted to know why I could not stand it as well as the rest I told him he knew well I had not been used to it for a long time that his overseer was the worst that had ever been on the plantation and that I could not stand it He said he would direct Mr Brooks to give each of us a pint of meal or corn every evening which we might bake and which would serve us next morning till our breakfast came at noon The black people were much rejoiced that I got this additional allowance for them But I was not satisfied I wanted liberty One Sunday morning as Master was sitting in his porch I went to him and offered to give him the dollars I had already paid him if beside them he would take for my freedom the dollars he had given for me He drove me away saying I had no way to get the money I sat down for a time and went to him again I repeated my offer to procure the dollars and he again said I could not He called his wife out of the room to the porch and said to her Don't you think Moses has taken to getting drunk She asked me if it was so I denied it when she inquired what was the matter Master replied Don't you think he wants me to sell him She said Moses we would not take any money for you Captain Cormack put a thousand dollars for you on the supper table last Friday night and Mr Sawyer would not touch it he wants you to be overseer in the Dismal Swamp I replied Captain Cormack never said anything to me about buying me I would cut my throat from ear to ear rather than go to him I know what made him say so he is courting Miss Patsey and he did it to make himself look big Mistress laughed and turned away and slammed to the door Master shook himself with laughing and put the paper he was reading before his face knowing that I spoke the truth Captain Cormack was an old man who went on crutches Miss Patsey was the finest of master's daughters Master drove me away from him again On Monday morning Mr Brooks the overseer blew the horn as usual for all to go to the field I refused to go I went to master and told him that if he would give me a paper I would go and fetch the dollars he then gave me a paper stating that he was willing to take that sum for my freedom so I hired an old horse and started for Norfolk fifty miles off When I reached Deep Creek I went to the house of Captain Edward Minner He was very glad to see me for in former days I had done much business for him he said how sorry he had been to hear that I was at field work He inquired where I was going I said to Norfolk to get some of the merchants to let me have money to buy myself He replied What did I always say to you Was it not that I would let you have the money at any time if you would only tell me when you could be sold He called Mrs Minner into the room and told her I could be sold for my freedom she was rejoiced to hear it He said Put up your horse at Mr Western's Tavern for you need go no farther I have plenty of old rusty dollars and no man shall put his hand on your collar again to say you are a slave Come and stay with me to night and in the morning I will get Mr Garrett's horse and go with you Next morning we set off and found master at Major Farrance's at the cross canal where I knew he was to be that day to sell his share of the canal When I saw him he told me to go forward home for he would not sell me I felt sick and sadly disappointed Captain Minner stepped up to him and shewed him the paper he had given me saying Mr Sawyer is not this your handwriting He replied Mistress said the last word when I came away I was not to sell him but send him home again Captain Minner said Mind gentlemen I do not want him for a slave I want to buy him for freedom He will repay me the money and I shall not charge him a cent of interest for it I would not have a coloured person to drag me down to hell for all the money in the world A gentleman who was by said it was a shame I should be so treated I had bought myself so often that Mr Sawyer ought to let me go The very worst man as an overseer over the persons employed in digging the canal Mr Wiley M'Pherson was there he was never known to speak in favour of a coloured person even he said that Mr Sawyer ought to let me go as I had been sold so often At length Mr Sawyer consented I should go for dollars and would take no less I wished Captain Minner to give the extra dollars and not to stand about it I believe it was what M'Pherson said that induced my master to let me go for he was well known for his great severity to coloured people so that after even he had said so master could not stand out The Lord must have opened M'Pherson's heart to say it I have said this M'Pherson was an overseer where slaves were employed in cutting canals The labour there is very severe The ground is often very boggy the negroes are up to the middle or much deeper in mud and water cutting away roots and baling out mud if they can keep their heads above water they work on They lodge in huts or as they are called camps made of shingles or boards They lie down in the mud which has adhered to them making a great fire to dry themselves and keep off the cold No bedding whatever is allowed them it is only by work done over his task that any of them can get a blanket They are paid nothing except for this overwork Their masters come once a month to receive the money for their labour then perhaps some few very good masters will give them two dollars each some others one dollar some a pound of tobacco and some nothing at all The food is more abundant than that of field slaves indeed it is the best allowance in America it consists of a peck of meal and six pounds of pork per week the pork is commonly not good it is damaged and is bought as cheap as possible at auctions M'Pherson gave the same task to each slave of course the weak ones often failed to do it I have often seen him tie up persons and flog them in the morning only because they were unable to get the previous day's task done after they were flogged pork or beef brine was put on their bleeding backs to increase the pain he sitting by resting himself and seeing it done After being thus flogged and pickled the sufferers often remained tied up all day the feet just touching the ground the legs tied and pieces of wood put between the legs All the motion allowed was a slight turn of the neck Thus exposed and helpless the yellow flies and musquitoes in great numbers would settle on the bleeding and smarting back and put the sufferer to extreme torture This continued all day for they were not taken down till night In flogging he would sometimes tie the slave's shirt over his head that he might not flinch when the blow was coming sometimes he would increase his misery by blustering and calling out that he was coming to flog again which he did or did not as happened I have seen him flog slaves with his own hands till their entrails were visible and I have seen the sufferers dead when they were taken down He never was called to account in any way for it It is not uncommon for flies to blow the sores made by flogging In that case we get a strong weed growing in those parts called the Oak of Jerusalem we boil it at night and wash the sores with the liquor which is extremely bitter on this the creepers or maggots come out To relieve them in some degree after severe flogging their fellow slaves rub their backs with part of their little allowance of fat meat For fear the slaves should run away while unable to work from flogging He kept them chained till they could work again This man had from to men under his control When out of other employment I sometimes worked under him and saw his doings I believe it was the word of this man which gained my freedom He is dead but there are yet others like him on public works When the great kindness of Captain Minner had set me clear of Mr Enoch Sawyer I went to my old occupation of working the canal boats These I took on shares as before After a time I was disabled for a year from following this employment by a severe attack of rheumatism caught by frequent exposure to severe weather I was anxious however to be earning something towards the repayment of Captain Minner lest any accident unforeseen by him or me should even yet deprive me of the liberty for which I so longed and for which I had suffered so much I therefore had myself carried in a lighter up a cross canal in the Dismal Swamp and to the other side of Drummond's Lake I was left on the shore and there I built myself a little hut and had provisions brought to me as opportunity served Here among snakes bears and panthers whenever my strength was sufficient I cut down a juniper tree and converted it into cooper's timber The camp like those commonly set up for negroes was entirely open on one side on that side a fire is lighted at night and the person sleeping puts his feet towards it One night I was awoke by some large animal smelling my face and snuffing strongly I felt its cold muzzle I suddenly thrust out my arms and shouted with all my might it was frightened and made off I do not know whether it was a bear or a panther but it seemed as tall as a large calf I slept of course no more that night I put my trust in the Lord and continued on the spot I was never attacked again I recovered and went to the canal boats again By the end of three years from the time he laid down the money I entirely repaid my very kind and excellent friend During this time he made no claim whatever on my services I was altogether on the footing of a free man as far as a coloured man can there be free When at length I had repaid Captain Minner and had got my free papers so that my freedom was quite secure my feelings were greatly excited I felt to myself so light that I almost thought I could fly and in my sleep I was always dreaming of flying over woods and rivers My gait was so altered by my gladness that people often stopped me saying Grandy what is the matter I excused myself as well as I could but many perceived the reason and said Oh he is so pleased with having got his freedom Slavery will teach any man to be glad when he gets freedom My good master Captain Minner sent me to Providence in Rhode Island to stay a year and a day in order to gain my residence But I stayed only two months Mr Howard's vessel came there laden with corn I longed much to see my master and mistress for the kindness they had done me and so went home in the schooner On my arrival I did not stop at my own house except to ask my wife at the door how she and the children were in health but went up the town to see Captain and Mrs Minner They were very glad to see me and consulted with me about my way of getting a living I wished to go on board the New York and Philadelphia Packets but feared I should be troubled for my freedom Captain Minner thought I might venture and I therefore engaged myself I continued in that employment till his death which happened about a year after my return from Providence Then I returned to Boston for while he lived I knew I could rely on his protection but when I lost my friend I thought it best to go wholly to the Northern States At Boston I went to work at sawing wood sawing with the whip saw labouring in the coal yards loading and unloading vessels c After labouring in this way for a few months I went a voyage to St John's in Porto Rico with Captain Cobb in the schooner New Packet On the return voyage the vessel got ashore on Cape Cod we left her after doing in vain what we could to right her she was afterwards recovered I went several other voyages and particularly two to the Mediterranean The last was to the East Indies in the ship James Murray Captain Woodbury owner Mr Gray My entire savings up to the period of my return from this voyage amounted to dollars I sent it to Virginia and bought my wife She came to me at Boston I dared not go myself to fetch her lest I should be again deprived of my liberty as often happens to free coloured people At the time called the time of the Insurrection about eight years ago when the whites said the coloured people were going to rise and shot hanged and otherwise destroyed many of them Mrs Minner thought she saw me in the street and fainted there The soldiers were seizing all the blacks they could find and she knew if I were there I should be sure to suffer with the rest She was mistaken I was not there My son's master at Norfolk sent a letter to me at Boston to say that if I could raise dollars I might have his freedom he was then fifteen years old I had again saved dollars I knew the master was a drinking man and I was therefore very anxious to get my son out of his hands I went to Norfolk running the risk of my liberty and took my dollars with me to make the best bargain I could Many gentlemen my friends in Boston advised me not to go myself but I was anxious to get my boy's freedom and I knew that nobody in Virginia had any cause of complaint against me so notwithstanding their advice I determined to go When the vessel arrived there they said it was against the law for me to go ashore The mayor of the city said I had been among the cursed Yankees too long He asked me whether I did not know that it was unlawful for me to land to which I replied that I did not know it for I could neither read nor write The merchants for whom I had formerly done business came on board and said they cared for neither the mare mayor nor the horse and insisted that I should go ashore I told the mayor the business on which I came and he gave me leave to stay nine days telling me that if I were not gone in that time he would sell me for the good of the State I offered my boy's master the dollars he counted the money but put it back to me refusing to take less than dollars I went on board to return to Boston We met with head winds and put back three times to Norfolk anchoring each time Just opposite the jail The nine days had expired and I feared the mayor would find me on board and sell me I could see the jail full of coloured people and even the whipping post at which they were constantly enduring the lash While we were lying there by the jail two vessels came from Eastern Shore Virginia laden with cattle and coloured people The cattle were lowing for their calves and the men and women were crying for their husbands wives or children The cries and groans were terrible notwithstanding there was a whipper on board each vessel trying to compel the poor creatures to keep silence These vessels lay close to ours I had been a long time away from such scenes the sight affected me very much and added greatly to my fears One day I saw a boat coming from the shore with white men in it I thought they were officers coming to take me and such was my horror of slavery that I twice ran to the ship's waist to jump overboard into the strong ebb tide then running to drown myself but a strong impression on my mind restrained me each time Once more we got under way for New York but meeting again with head winds we ran into Maurice's River in Delaware Bay New Jersey in which that place lies is not a slave state So I said to the captain Let me have a boat and set me on the free land once more then I will travel home overland for I will not run the risk of going back to Virginia any more The captain said there was no danger but I exclaimed No no captain I will not try it put my feet on free land once again and I shall be safe When I once more touched the free land the burthen of my mind was removed if two ton weight had been taken of me the relief would not have seemed so great From Maurice's Creek I traveled to Philadelphia and at that place had a letter written to my wife at Boston thanking God that I was on free land again On arriving at Boston I borrowed dollars of a friend and going to New York I obtained the help of Mr John Williams to send the dollars to Norfolk thus at length I bought my son's freedom I met him at New York and brought him on to Boston Six others of my children three boys and three girls were sold to New Orleans Two of these daughters have bought their own freedom The eldest of them Catherine was sold three times after she was taken away from Virginia the first time was by auction Her last master but one was a Frenchman she worked in his sugar cane and cotton fields Another Frenchman inquired for a girl on whom he could depend to wait on his wife who was in a consumption Her master offered him my daughter they went into the field to see her and the bargain was struck Her new master gave her up to his sick wife on whom she waited till her death As she had waited exceedingly well on his wife her master offered her a chance of buying her freedom She objected to his terms as too high for he required her to pay him four dollars a week out of her earnings and dollars for her freedom He said he could get more for her and told her she might get plenty of washing at a dollar a dozen at last she agreed She lived near the river side and obtained plenty of work So anxious was she to obtain her freedom that she worked nearly all her time days and nights and Sundays She found however she gained nothing by working on Sundays and therefore left it off She paid her master punctually her weekly hire and also something towards her freedom for which he gave her receipts A good stewardess was wanted for a steam boat on the Mississippi she was hired for the place at thirty dollars a month which is the usual salary she also had liberty to sell apples and oranges on board and commonly the passengers give from twenty five cents to a dollar to a stewardess who attends them Well Her entire incoming wages and all amounted to about sixty dollars a month She remained at this employment till she had paid the entire sum of dollars for her freedom As soon as she obtained her free papers she left the steam boat thinking she could find her sister Charlotte Her two first trials were unsuccessful but On the third attempt she found her at work in the cane field She shewed her sister's master her own free papers and told him how she had bought herself he said that if her sister would pay him as much as she paid her master she might go too They agreed and he gave her a pass The two sisters went on board a steam boat and worked together for the wages of one till they had saved the entire dollars for the freedom of the second sister The husband of Charlotte was dead her children were left behind in the cotton and cane fields their master refuses to take less than dollars for them their names and ages are as follows Zeno about fifteen Antoinette about thirteen Joseph about eleven and Josephine about ten years old Of my other children I only know that one a girl named Betsy is a little way from Norfolk in Virginia Her master Mr William Dixon is willing to sell her for dollars I do not know where any of my other four children are nor whether they be dead or alive It will be very difficult to find them out for the names of slaves are commonly changed with every change of master they usually bear the name of the master to whom they belong at the time They have no family name of their own by which they can be traced Owing to this circumstance and their ignorance of reading and writing to which they are compelled by law all trace between parents and their children who are separated from them in childhood is lost in a few years When therefore a child is sold away from its mother she feels that she is parting from it for ever there is little likelihood of her ever knowing what of good or evil befals it The way of finding out a friend or relative who has been sold away for any length of time or to any great distance is to trace him if possible to one master after another or if that cannot be done to inquire about the neighbourhood where he is supposed to be until some one is found who can tell that such a person belonged to such or such a master and the person supposed to be the one sought for may perhaps remember the names of the persons to whom his father and mother belonged There is little to be learnt from his appearance for so many years may have passed away that he may have grown out of the memory of his parents or his nearest relations There are thus no lasting family ties to bind relations together not even the nearest and this aggravates their distress when they are sold from each other I have little hope of finding my four children again I have lived at Boston ever since I bought my freedom except during the last year which I have spent at Portland in the state of Maine I have yet said nothing of my father He was often sold through the failure of his successive owners When I was a little boy he was sold away from us to a distance he was then so far off that he could not come to see us oftener than once a year After that he was sold to go still further away and then he could not come at all I do not know what has become of him When my mother became old she was sent to live in a little lonely log hut in the woods Aged and worn out slaves whether men or women are commonly so treated No care is taken of them except perhaps that a little ground is cleared about the hut on which the old slave if able may raise a little corn As far as the owner is concerned they live or die as it happens is is just the same thing as turning out an old horse Their children or other near relations if living in the neighbourhood take it by turns to go at night with a supply saved out of their own scanty allowance of food as well as to cut wood and fetch water for them this is done entirely through the good feelings of the slaves and not through the masters' taking care that it is done On these night visits the aged inmate of the hut is often found crying on account of sufferings from disease or extreme weakness or from want of food and water in the course of the day many a time when I have drawn near to my mother's hut I have heard her grieving and crying on these accounts she was old and blind too and so unable to help herself She was not treated worse than others it is the general practice Some few good masters do not treat their old slaves so they employ them in doing light jobs about the house and garden My eldest sister is in Elizabeth City She has five children who of course are slaves Her master is willing to sell her for dollars she is growing old One of her children a young man cannot be bought under dollars My sister Tamar who belonged to the same master with myself had children very fast Her husband had hard owners and lived at a distance When a woman who has many children belongs to an owner who is under age as ours was it is customary to put her and the children out yearly to the person who will maintain them for the least money the person taking them having the benefit of whatever work the woman can do But my sister was put to herself in the woods She had a bit of ground cleared and was left to hire herself out to labour On the ground she raised corn and flax and obtained a peck of corn some herrings or a piece of meat for a day's work among the neighbouring owners In this way she brought up her children Her husband could help her but little As soon as each of the children became big enough it was sold away from her After parting thus with five she was sold along with the sixth about a year and a half old to the speculators these are persons who buy slaves in Carolina and Virginia to sell them in Georgia and New Orleans After travelling with them more than miles she made her escape but could not obtain her child to take it with her On her journey homeward she traveled by night and hid herself in thick woods by day She was in great danger on the road but in three weeks reached the woods near us There she had to keep herself concealed I my mother and her husband knew where she was she lived in a den she made for herself She sometimes ventured down to my mother's hut where she was hid in a hollow under the floor Her husband lived twenty five miles off he would sometimes set off after his day's work was done spend part of the night with her and get back to work before next sunrise sometimes he would spend Sunday with her We all supplied her with such provisions as we could save It was necessary to be very careful in visiting her we tied pieces of wood or bundles of rags to our feet that no track might be made In the wood she had three children born one of them died She had not recovered from the birth of the youngest when she was discovered and taken to the house of her old master She was afterwards sold to Culpepper who used her very cruelly He was beating her dreadfully and the blood was streaming from her head and back one day when I happened to go to his house I was greatly grieved and asked his leave to find a person to buy her instead of answering me he struck at me with an axe and I was obliged to get away as fast as I could Soon after he failed and she was offered for sale in Norfolk there Mr Johnson bought her and her two children out of friendship for me he treated her exceedingly well and she served him faithfully but it was not long before she was claimed by a person to whom Culpepper had mortgaged her before he sold her to Johnson This person sold her to Long of Elizabeth City where again she was very badly treated After a time Long sold her to go to Georgia she was very in at the time and was taken away in a cart I hear from her sometimes and am very anxious to purchase her freedom if ever I should be able Two of her children are now in North Carolina and are longing to obtain their freedom I know nothing of the others nor am I likely ever to hear of them again The treatment of slaves is mildest near the borders where the free and slave states join it becomes more severe the further we go from the free states It is more severe in the west and south than where I lived The sale of slaves most frequently takes place from the milder to the severer parts in that directtion there is great traffic in slaves which is carried on by the speculators On the frontier between the slave and free states there is a guard no coloured person can go over a ferry without a pass By these regulations and the great numbers of patrols escape is made very difficult Formerly slaves were allowed to have religious meetings of their own but after the insurrection which I spoke of before they were forbidden to meet even for worship Often they are flogged if they are found singing or praying at home They may go to the places of worship used by the whites but they like their own meetings better My wife's brother Isaac was a coloured preacher A number of slaves went privately into the wood to hold meetings when they were found out they were flogged and each was forced to tell who else was there Three were shot two of whom were killed and the other was badly wounded For preaching to them Isaac was flogged and his back pickled when he was nearly well he was flogged and pickled again and so on for some months then his back was suffered to get well and he was sold A little while before this his wife was sold away with an infant at her breast and of his six children four had been sold away by one at a time On the way with his buyers he dropped down dead his heart was broken Having thus narrated what has happened to myself my relatives and near friends I will add a few matters about slaves and coloured persons in general Slaves are under fear in every word they speak If in their master's kitchen they let slip an expression of discontent or a wish for freedom it is often reported to the master or mistress by the children of the family who may be playing about severe flogging is often the consequence I have already said that it is forbidden by law to teach coloured persons to read or write A few well disposed white young persons of the families to which the slaves belonged have ventured to teach them but they dare not let it be known they have done so The proprietors get new land cleared in this way They first dead a piece of ground in the woods adjoining the plantation By deading is meant killing the trees by cutting a nick all round each quite through the bark Out of this ground each coloured person has a piece as large as he can tend after his other work is done the women have pieces in like manner The slave works at night cutting down the timber and clearing the ground after it is cleared he has it for his own use for two or three years as may be agreed on As these new clearings lie between the woods and the old cultivated land the squirrels and racoons first come at the crops on them and thus those on the planters' land are saved from much waste When the negro has had the land for the specified time and it has become fit for the plough the master takes it and he is removed to another new piece It is no uncommon thing for the land to be taken from him before the time is out if it has sooner become fit for the plough When the crop is gathered the master comes to see how much there is of it he then gives the negro an order to sell that quantity without that order no storekeeper dare buy it The slave lays out the money in something tidy to go to meeting in and something to take to his wife The evidence of a black man or of ever so many black men stands for nothing against that of one white in consequence of this the free negroes are liable to great cruelties They have had their dwellings entered their bedding and furniture destroyed themselves their wives and children beaten some have even been taken with their wives into the woods and tied up flogged and left there There is nothing which a white man may not do against a black one if he only takes care that no other white man can give evidence against him A law has lately been passed in New Orleans prohibiting any free coloured person from going there The coasting packets of the ports on the Atlantic commonly have coloured cooks When a vessel goes from New York or Boston to a port in the slave holding estates the black cook is usually put in jail till the vessel sails again No coloured person can travel without a pass If he cannot show it he may be flogged by any body in such a case he often is seized and flogged by the patrols all through the slave states there are patrols they are so numerous that they cannot easily be escaped The only time when a man can visit his wife when they are on different estates is Saturday evening and Sunday If they be very near to each other he may sometimes see her on Wednesday evening He must always return to his work by sunrise if he fail to do so he is flogged When he has got together all the little things he can for his wife and children and has walked many miles to see them he may find that they have all been sold away some in one direction and some in another He gives up all hope of seeing them again but he dare not utter a word of complaint It often happens that when a slave wishes to visit his wife on another plantation his own master is busy or from home and therefore he cannot get a pass He ventures without it If there be any little spite against his wife or himself he maybe asked for it when he arrives and not having it he may be beaten with thirty nine stripes and sent away On his return he may be seized by the patrol and flogged again for the same reason and he will not wonder if he is again seized and beaten for the third time If a negro has given offence to the patrol even by so innocent a matter as dressing tidily to go to a place of worship he will be seized by one of them and another will tear up his pass while one is flogging him the others will look another way so when he or his master make complaint of his having been beaten without cause and he points out the person who did it the others will swear they saw no one beat him His oath being that of a black man would stand for nothing but he may not even be sworn and in such a case his tormentors are safe for they were the only whites present In all the slave states there are men who make a trade of whipping negroes they ride about inquiring for jobs of persons who keep no overseer if there is a negro to be whipped whether man or woman this man is employed when he calls and does it immediately his fee is half a dollar Widows and other females having negroes get them whipped in this way Many mistresses will insist on the slave who has been flogged begging pardon for her fault on her knees and thanking her for the correction A white man who lived near me in Camden county Thomas Evidge followed this business He was also sworn whipper at the Court House A law was passed that any white man detected in stealing should be whipped Mr Dozier frequently missed hogs and flogged many of his negroes on suspicion of stealing them when he could not in his suspicions fix on any one in particular he flogged them all round saying that he was sure of having punished the right one Being one day shooting in his woods he heard the report of another gun and shortly after met David Evidge the nephew of the whipper with one of his hogs on his back which had just been shot David was sent to prison convicted of the theft and sentenced to be flogged His uncle who vapoured about greatly in flogging slaves and taunted them with unfeeling speeches while he did it could not bear the thought of flogging his nephew and hired a man to do it The person pitched on chanced to be a sailor he laid it well on the thief pleased enough were the coloured people to see a white back for the first time subjected to the lash Another man of the same business George Wilkins did no greater credit to the trade Mr Carnie on Western Branch Virginia often missed corn from his barn Wilkins the whipper was very officious in pointing out this slave and that as very likely to be the thief with nothing against them but his insinuations some were severely punished being flogged by this very Wilkins and others at his instigation were sold away One night Mr Carnie unknown to his coloured people set a steel trap in the barn Some of the negroes passing the barn before morning saw Wilkins standing there but were not aware he was caught They called the master that he might seize the thief before he could escape he came and teased Wilkins during the night in the morning he exposed him to the view of the neighbours and then set him at liberty without further punishment The very severe punishments to which slaves are subjected for trifling offences or none at all their continued liability to all kinds of in usage without a chance of redress and the agonizing feelings they endure at being separated from the dearest connexions drive many of them to desperation and they abscond They hide themselves in the woods where they remain for months and in some cases for years When caught they are flogged with extreme severity their backs are pickled and the flogging repeated as before described After months of this torture the back is allowed to heal and the slave is sold away Especially is this done when the slave has attempted to reach a free state In violent thunder storms when the whites have got between feather beds to be safe from the lightning I have often seen negroes the aged as well as others go out and lifting up their hands thank God that judgment was coming at last So cruelly are many of them used that judgment they think would be a happy release from their horrible slavery The proprietors though they live in luxury generally die in debt their negroes are so hardly treated that no profit is made by their labour Many of them are great gamblers At the death of a proprietor it commonly happens that his coloured people are sold towards paying his debts So it must and will be with the masters while slavery continues when freedom is established I believe they will begin to prosper greatly Before I close this Narrative I ought to express my grateful thanks to the many friends in the Northern States who have encouraged and assisted me I shall never forget to speak of their kindness and to pray for their prosperity I am delighted to say that not only to myself but to very many other coloured persons they have lent a benevolent helping hand Last year gentlemen whom I know bought no less than ten families from slavery and this year they are pursuing the same good work But for these numerous and heavy claims on their means and their kindness I should have had no need to appeal to the generosity of the British public they would gladly have helped me to redeem all my children and relations When I first went to the Northern States which is about ten years ago although I was free as to the law I was made to feel severely the difference between persons of different colours No black man was admitted to the same seats in churches with the whites nor to the inside of public conveyances nor into street coaches or cabs we had to be content with the decks of steam boats in all weathers night and day not even our wives or children being allowed to go below however it might rain or snow or freeze in various other ways we were treated as though we were of a race of men below the whites But the abolitionists boldly stood up for us and through them things are much changed for the better Now we may sit in any part of many places of worship and are even asked into the pews of respectable white families many public conveyances now make no distinction between white and black We begin to feel that we are really on the same footing as our fellow citizens They see we can and do conduct ourselves with propriety and they are now admitting us in many cases to the same standing with themselves During the struggles which have procured for us this justice from our fellow citizens we have been in the habit of looking in public places for some well known abolitionists and if none that we knew were there we addressed any person dressed as a Quaker these classes always took our part against ill usage and we have to thank them for many a contest in our behalf We were greatly delighted by the zealous efforts and powerful eloquence in our cause of Mr George Thompson who came from our English friends to aid our suffering brethren He was hated and mobbed by bad men amongst the whites they put his life in great danger and threatened destruction to all who sheltered him We prayed for him and did all we could to defend him The Lord preserved him and thankful were we when he escaped from our country with his life At that time and ever since we have had a host of American friends who have laboured for the cause night and day they have nobly stood up for the rights and honour of the coloured man but they did so at first in the midst of scorn and danger Now thank God the case is very different Mr William Lloyd Garrison who was hunted for his life by a mob in the streets of Boston has lately been chairman of a large meeting in favour of abolition held in Fanueil Hall the celebrated public hall of Boston called the Cradle of Liberty I am glad to say also that numbers of my coloured brethren now escape from slavery some by purchasing their freedom others by quitting through many dangers and hardships the land of bondage The latter suffer many privations in their attempts to reach the free states They hide themselves during the day in the woods and swamps at night they travel crossing rivers by swimming or by boats they may chance to meet with and passing over hills and meadows which they do not know in these dangerous journeys they are guided by the north star for they only know that the land of freedom is in the north They subsist on such wild fruit as they can gather and as they are often very long on their way they reach the free states almost like skeletons On their arrival they have no friends but such as pity those who have been in bondage the number of which I am happy to say is increasing but if they can meet with a man in a broadbrimmed hat and Quaker coat they speak to him without fear relying on him as a friend At each place the escaped slave inquires for an abolitionist or a Quaker and these friends of the coloured man help them on their journey northwards until they are out of the reach of danger Our untiring friends the abolitionists once obtained a law that no coloured person should be seized as a slave within the free states this law would have been of great service to us by ridding us of all anxiety about our freedom while we remained there but I am sorry to say that it has lately been repealed and that now as before any coloured person who is said to be a slave may be seized in the free states and carried away no matter how long he may have resided there as also may his children and their children although they all may have been born there I hope this law will soon be altered again At present many escaped slaves are forwarded by their friends to Canada where under British rule they are quite safe There is a body of ten thousand of them in Upper Canada they are known for their good order and loyalty to the British government during the late troubles they could always be relied on for the defence of the British possessions against the lawless Americans who attempted to invade them As to the settlement of Liberia on the coast of Africa the free coloured people of America do not willingly go to it America is their home if their forefathers lived in Africa they themselves know nothing of that country None but free coloured people are taken there if they would take slaves they might have plenty of colonists Slaves will go any where for freedom We look very much to Great Britain and Ireland for help Whenever we hear of the British or Irish people doing good to black men we are delighted and run to tell each other the news Our kind friends the abolitionists are very much encouraged when they hear of meetings and speeches in England in our cause The first of August the day when the slaves in the West Indies were made free is always kept as a day of rejoicing by the American coloured free people I do hope and believe that the cause of freedom to the blacks is becoming stronger and stronger every day I pray for the time to come when freedom shall be established all over the world Then will men love as brethren they will delight to do good to one another and they will thankfully worship the Father of all And now I have only to repeat my hearty thanks to all who have done any thing towards obtaining liberty for my coloured brethren and especially to express my gratitude to those who have helped me to procure for myself my wife and some of my children the blessing of freedom a blessing of which none can know the value but he who has been a slave Whatever profit may be obtained by the sale of this book and all donations with which I may be favoured will be faithfully employed in redeeming my remaining children and relatives from the dreadful condition of slavery Mr Scoble the Secretary of the British and Foreign Anti slavery Society has

Sojourner-Truth,NARRATIVE OF SOJOURNER TRUTH A NORTHERN SLAVE EMANCIPATED FROM BODILY SERVITUDE BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN WITH A PORTRAIT SWEET is the virgin honey though the wild bee store it in a reed And bright the jewelled band that circleth an Ethiop's arm Pure are the grains of gold in the turbid stream of the Ganges And fair the living flowers that spring from the dull cold sod Wherefore thou gentle student bend thine ear to my speech For I also am as thou art our hearts can commune together To meanest matters will I stoop for mean is the lot of mortal I will rise to noblest themes for the soul hath a heritage of glory BOSTON PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR verso J B YERRINTON AND SON PRINTERS CORNHILL BOSTON v PREFACE THE following is the unpretending narrative of the life of a remarkable and meritorious woman a life which has been checkered by strange vicissitudes severe hardships and singular adventures Born a slave and held in that brutal condition until the entire abolition of slavery in the State of New York in she has known what it is to drink to the dregs the bitterest cup of human degradation That one thus placed on a level with cattle and swine and for so many years subjected to the most demoralizing influences should have retained her moral integrity to such an extent and cherished so successfully the religious sentiment in her soul shows a mind of no common order while it heightens the detestation that is felt in every humane bosom of that system of oppression which seeks to cripple the intellect impair the understanding and deprave the hearts of vi its victims a system which has subjected to its own foul purposes in the United States all that is wealthy talented influential and reputedly pious in an overwhelming measure O the 'fantastic tricks' which the American people are 'playing before high Heaven ' O their profane use of the sacred name of Liberty O their impious appeal to the God of the oppressed for his divine benediction while they are making merchandise of his image Do they not blush Nay they glory in their shame Once a year they take special pains to exhibit themselves to the world in all their republican deformity and Christian barbarity insanely supposing that they thus excite the envy admiration and applause of mankind The nations are looking at the dreadful spectacle with disgust and amazement However sunken and degraded they may be they are too elevated too virtuous too humane to be guilty of such conduct Their voice is heard saying 'Americans we hear your boasts of liberty your shouts of independence your declarations of hostility to every form of tyranny your assertions that all men are created free and equal and endowed by their Creator with an inalienable right to liberty the merry peal of your bells and the deafening roar of your artillery but mingling with all these and rising above them all we also hear the clanking of chains the shrieks and wailings of millions of your own countrymen whom you wickedly hold in a state of slavery as much more frightful than the oppression vii which your fathers resisted unto blood as the tortures of the Inquisition surpass the stings of an insect We see your banner floating proudly in the breeze from every flag staff and mast head in the land but its blood red stripes are emblematical of your own slave driving cruelty as you apply the lash to the flesh of your guiltless victim even the flesh of a wife and mother shrieking for the restoration of the babe of her bosom sold to the remorseless slave speculator We catch the gleam of your illuminated hills everywhere blazing with bonfires we mark your gay processions we note the number of your orators we listen to the recital of your revolutionary achievements we see you kneeling at the shrine of Freedom as her best her truest her sincerest worshippers Hypocrites liars adulterers tyrants men stealers atheists Professing to believe in the natural equality of the human race yet dooming a sixth portion of your immense population to beastly servitude and ranking them among your goods and chattels Professing to believe in the existence of a God yet trading in his image and selling those in the shambles for whose redemption the Son of God laid down his life Professing to be Christians yet withholding the Bible the means of religious instruction even the knowledge of the alphabet from a benighted multitude under terrible penalties Boasting of your democracy yet determining the rights of men by the texture of their hair and the color of their skin Assuming to be 'the land of the free and the home of the viii brave yet keeping in chains more slaves than any other nation not excepting slave cursed Brazil Prating of your morality and honesty yet denying the rites of marriage to three millions of human beings and plundering them of all their hard earnings Affecting to be horror struck in view of the foreign slave trade yet eagerly pursuing a domestic traffic equally cruel and unnatural and reducing to slavery not less than seventy thousand new victims annually Vaunting of your freedom of speech and of the press your matchless Constitution and your glorious Union yet denouncing as traitors and treating as outlaws those who have the courage and fidelity to plead for immediate untrammelled universal emancipation Monsters that ye are how can ye expect to escape the scorn of the world and the wrath of Heaven Emancipate your slaves if you would redeem your tarnished character if you would obtain forgiveness here and salvation hereafter Until you do so there will be a stain upon your national escutcheon which all the waters of the Atlantic cannot wash out ' It is thus that as a people we are justly subjected to the reproach the execration the derision of mankind and are made a proverb and a hissing among the nations We cannot plead not guilty every accusation that is registered against us is true the act of violence is in our hands the stolen property is in our possession our fingers are stained with blood the cup of our iniquity is full ix 'Just God and shall we calmly rest The Christian's scorn the Heathen's mirth Content to live the lingering jest And by word of a mocking earth Shall our own glorious land retain That curse which Europe scorns to bear Shall our own brethren drag the chain Which not even Russia's menials wear ' It is useless it is dreadful it is impious for this nation longer to contend with the Almighty All his attributes are against us and on the side of the oppressed Is it not a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God Who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth as 'a swift witness against the adulterers and against false swearers and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages the widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger from his right ' Wo to this bloody land it is all full of lies and robbery the prey departeth not and the sound of a whip is heard continually 'Judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth afar off for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter Yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey The Lord sees it and is displeased that there is no judgment and he hath put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and is clad with zeal as a cloak ' and unless we repent by immediately undoing the heavy burdens and letting the oppressed go free according to our deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries x recompense to his enemies 'The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed ' 'O give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever To him that smote Egypt in their first born for his mercy endureth for ever And overthrew Pharaoh and his hosts in the Red sea for his mercy endureth for ever ' 'Sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea Thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in the mighty waters ' 'Even so Lord God Almighty for so it seemeth good in thy sight ' 'Who is like unto thee O Lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders ' In this great contest of Right against Wrong of Liberty against Slavery who are the wicked if they be not those who like vultures and vampyres are gorging themselves with human blood if they be not the plunderers of the poor the spoilers of the defenceless the traffickers in 'slaves and the souls of men ' Who are the cowards if not those who shrink from manly argumentation the light of truth the concussion of mind and a fair field if not those whose prowess stimulated by whiskey potations or the spirit of murder grows rampant as the darkness of night approaches whose shouts and yells are savage and fiend like who furiously exclaim 'Down with free discussion down with the liberty of the press down with xi the right of petition down with constitutional law ' who rifle mail bags throw types and printing presses into the river burn public halls dedicated to 'Virtue Liberty and Independence' and assassinate the defenders of inalienable human rights And who are the righteous in this case if they be not those who will 'have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them ' who maintain that the laborer is worthy of his hire that the marriage institution is sacred that slavery is a system accursed of God that tyrants are the enemies of mankind and that immediate emancipation should be given to all who are pining in bondage Who are the truly brave if not those who demand for truth and error alike free speech a free press in open arena the right of petition AND NO QUARTERS if not those who instead of skulking from the light stand forth in the noon tide blaze of day and challenge their opponents to emerge from their wolf like dens that by a rigid examination it may be seen who has stolen the wedge of gold in whose pocket are the thirty pieces of silver and whose garments are stained with the blood of innocence It is hoped that the perusal of the following Narrative may increase the sympathy that is felt for the suffering colored population of this country and inspire to renewed efforts for the liberation of all who are pining in bondage on the American soil xii NOTE IT is due to the lady by whom the following Narrative was kindly written to state that she has not been able to see a single proof sheet of it consequently it is very possible that divers errors in printing may have occurred though it is hoped none materially affecting the sense especially in regard to the names of individuals referred to therein The name of Van Wagener should read Van Wagenen NARRATIVE OF SOJOURNER TRUTH HER BIRTH AND PARENTAGE THE subject of this biography SOJOURNER TRUTH as she now calls herself but whose name originally was lsabella was born as near as she can now calculate between the years and She was the daughter of James and Betsey slaves of one Colonel Ardinburgh Hurley Ulster County New York Colonel Ardinburgh belonged to that class of people called Low Dutch Of her first master she can give no account as she must have been a mere infant when he died and she with her parents and some ten or twelve other fellow human chattels became the legal property of his son Charles Ardinburgh She distinctly remembers hearing her father and mother say that their lot was a fortunate one as Master Charles was the best of the family being comparatively speaking a kind master to his slaves James and Betsey having by their faithfulness docility and respectful behavior won his particular regard received from him particular favors among which was a lot of land lying back on the slope of a mountain where by improving the pleasant evenings and Sundays they managed to raise a little tobacco corn or flax which they exchanged for extras in the articles of food or clothing for themselves and children She has no remembrance that Saturday afternoon was ever added to their own time as it is by some masters in the Southern States ACCOMMODATIONS Among Isabella's earliest recollections was the removal of her master Charles Ardinburgh into his new house which he had built for a hotel soon after the decease of his father A cellar under this hotel was assigned to his slaves as their sleeping apartment all the slaves he possessed of both sexes sleeping as is quite common in a state of slavery in the same room She carries in her mind to this day a vivid picture of this dismal chamber its only lights consisting of a few panes of glass through which she thinks the sun never shone but with thrice reflected rays and the space between the loose boards of the floor and the uneven earth below was often filled with mud and water the uncomfortable splashings of which were as annoying as its noxious vapors must have been chilling and fatal to health She shudders even now as she goes back in memory and revisits this cellar and sees its inmates of both sexes and all ages sleeping on those damp boards like the horse with a little straw and a blanket and she wonders not at the rheumatisms and fever sores and palsies that distorted the limbs and racked the bodies of those fellow slaves in after life Still she does not attribute this cruelty for cruelty it certainly is to be so unmindful of the health and comfort of any being leaving entirely out of sight his more important part his everlasting interests so much to any innate or constitutional cruelty of the master as to that gigantic inconsistency that inherited habit among slaveholders of expecting a willing and intelligent obedience from the slave because he is a MAN at the same time every thing belonging to the soul harrowing system does its best to crush the last vestige of a man within him and when it is crushed and often before he is denied the comforts of life on the plea that he knows neither the want nor the use of them and because he is considered to be little more or little less than a beast HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS Isabella's father was very tall and straight when young which gave him the name of 'Bomefree' low Dutch for tree at least this is SOJOURNER'S pronunciation of it and by this name he usually went The most familiar appellation of her mother was 'Mau mau Bett ' She was the mother of some ten or twelve children though Sojourner is far from knowing the exact number of her brothers and sisters she being the youngest save one and all older than herself having been sold before her remembrance She was privileged to behold six of them while she remained a slave Of the two that immediately preceded her in age a boy of five years and a girl of three who were sold when she was an infant she heard much and she wishes that all who would fain believe that slave parents have not natural affection for their offspring could have listened as she did while Bomefree and Mau mau Bett their dark cellar lighted by a blazing pine knot would sit for hours recalling and recounting every endearing as well as harrowing circumstance that taxed memory could supply from the histories of those dear departed ones of whom they had been robbed and for whom their hearts still bled Among the rest they would relate how the little boy on the last morning he was with them arose with the birds kindled a fire calling for his Mau mau to 'come for all was now ready for her' little dreaming of the dreadful separation which was so near at hand but of which his parents had an uncertain but all the more cruel foreboding There was snow on the ground at the time of which we are speaking and a large old fashioned sleigh was seen to drive up to the door of the late Col Ardinburgh This event was noticed with childish pleasure by the unsuspicious boy but when he was taken and put into the sleigh and saw his little sister actually shut and locked into the sleigh box his eyes were at once opened to their intentions and like a frightened deer he sprang from the sleigh and running into the house concealed himself under a bed But this availed him little He was re conveyed to the sleigh and separated for ever from those whom God had constituted his natural guardians and protectors and who should have found him in return a stay and a staff to them in their declining years But I make no comments on facts like these knowing that the heart of every slave parent will make its own comment involuntarily and correctly as soon as each heart shall make the case its own Those who are not parents will draw their conclusions from the promptings of humanity and philanthropy these enlightened by reason and revelation are also unerring HER RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION Isabella and Peter her youngest brother remained with their parents the legal property of Charles Ardinburgh till his decease which took place when Isabella was near nine years old After this event she was often surprised to find her mother in tears and when in her simplicity she inquired 'Mau mau what makes you cry ' she would answer Oh my child I am thinking of your brothers and sisters that have been sold away from me ' And she would proceed to detail many circumstances respecting them But Isabella long since concluded that it was the impending fate of her only remaining children which her mother but too well understood even then that called up those memories from the past and made them crucify her heart afresh In the evening when her mother's work was done she would sit down under the sparkling vault of heaven and calling her children to her would talk to them of the only Being that could effectually aid or protect them Her teachings were delivered in Low Dutch her only language and translated into English ran nearly as follows 'My children there is a God who hears and sees you ' 'A God mau mau Where does he live ' asked the children 'He lives in the sky ' she replied 'and when you are beaten or cruelly treated or fall into any trouble you must ask help of him and he will always hear and help you ' She taught them to kneel and say the Lord's prayer She entreated them to refrain from lying and stealing and to strive to obey their masters At times a groan would escape her and she would break out in the language of the Psalmist 'Oh Lord how long ' 'Oh Lord how long ' And in reply to Isabella's question 'What ails you mau mau ' her only answer was 'Oh a good deal ails me' 'Enough ails me ' Then again she would point them to the stars and say in her peculiar language 'Those are the same stars and that is the same moon that look down upon your brothers and sisters and which they see as they look up to them though they are ever so far away from us and each other ' Thus in her humble way did she endeavor to show them their Heavenly Father as the only being who could protect them in their perilous condition at the same time she would strengthen and brighten the chain of family affection which she trusted extended itself sufficiently to connect the widely scattered members of her precious flock These instructions of the mother were treasured up and held sacred by Isabella as our future narrative will show THE AUCTION At length the never to be forgotten day of the terrible auction arrived when the 'slaves horses and other cattle' of Charles Ardinburgh deceased were to be put under the hammer and again change masters Not only Isabella and Peter but their mother was now destined to the auction block and would have been struck off with the rest to the highest bidder but for the following circumstance A question arose among the heirs 'Who shall be burthened with Bomefree when we have sent away his faithful Mau mau Bett ' He was becoming weak and infirm his limbs were painfully rheumatic and distorted more from exposure and hardship than from old age though he was several years older than Mau mau Bett he was no longer considered of value but must soon be a burthen and a care to some one After some contention on the point at issue none being willing to be burthened with him it was finally agreed as most expedient for the heirs that the price of Mau mau Bett should be sacrificed and she receive her freedom on condition that she take care of and support her faithful James faithful not only to her as a husband but proverbially faithful as a slave to those who would not willingly sacrifice a dollar for his comfort now that he had commenced his descent into the dark vale of decrepitude and suffering This important decision was received as joyful news indeed to our ancient couple who were the objects of it and who were trying to prepare their hearts for a severe struggle and one altogether new to them as they had never before been separated for though ignorant helpless crushed in spirit and weighed down with hardship and cruel bereavement they were still human and their human hearts beat within them with as true an affection as ever caused a human heart to beat And their anticipated separation now in the decline of life after the last child had been torn from them must have been truly appalling Another privilege was granted them that of remaining occupants of the same dark humid cellar I have before described otherwise they were to support themselves as they best could And as her mother was still able to do considerable work and her father a little they got on for some time very comfortably The strangers who rented the house were humane people and very kind to them they were not rich and owned no slaves How long this state of things continued we are unable to say as Isabella had not then sufficiently cultivated her organ of time to calculate years or even weeks or hours But she thinks her mother must have lived several years after the death of Master Charles She remembers going to visit her parents some three or four times before the death of her mother and a good deal of time seemed to her to intervene between each visit At length her mother's health began to decline a fever sore made its ravages on one of her limbs and the palsy began to shake her frame still she and James tottered about picking up a little here and there which added to the mites contributed by their kind neighbors sufficed to sustain life and drive famine from the door DEATH OF MAU MAU BETT One morning in early autumn from the reason above mentioned we cannot tell what year Mau mau Bett told James she would make him a loaf of rye bread and get Mrs Simmons their kind neighbor to bake it for them as she would bake that forenoon James told her he had engaged to rake after the cart for his neighbors that morning but before he commenced he would pole off some apples from a tree near which they were allowed to gather and if she could get some of them baked with the bread it would give it a nice relish for their dinner He beat off the apples and soon after saw Mau mau Bett come out and gather them up At the blowing of the horn for dinner he groped his way into his cellar anticipating his humble but warm and nourishing meal when lo instead of being cheered by the sight and odor of fresh baked bread and the savory apples his cellar seemed more cheerless than usual and at first neither sight nor sound met eye or ear But on groping his way through the room his staff which he used as a pioneer to go before and warn him of danger seemed to be impeded in its progress and a low gurgling choaking sound proceeded from the object before him giving him the first intimation of the truth as it was that Mau mau Bett his bosom companion the only remaining member of his large family had fallen in a fit of the palsy and lay helpless and senseless on the earth Who among us located in pleasant homes surrounded with every comfort and so many kind and sympathizing friends can picture to ourselves the dark and desolate state of poor old James penniless weak lame and nearly blind as he was at the moment he found his companion was removed from him and he was left alone in the world with no one to aid comfort or console him for she never revived again and lived only a few hours after being discovered senseless by her poor bereaved James LAST DAYS OF BOMEFREE Isabella and Peter were permitted to see the remains of their mother laid in their last narrow dwelling and to make their bereaved father a little visit ere they returned to their servitude And most piteous were the lamentations of the poor old man when at last they also were obliged to bid him 'Farewell ' Juan Fernandes on his desolate island was not so pitiable an object as this poor lame man Blind and crippled he was too superannuated to think for a moment of taking care of himself and he greatly feared no persons would interest themselves in his behalf 'Oh ' he would exclaim 'I had thought God would take me first Mau mau was so much smarter than I and could get about and take care of herself and I am so old and so helpless What is to become of me I can't do any thing more my children are all gone and here I am left helpless and alone ' 'And then as I was taking leave of him ' said his daughter in relating it 'he raised his voice and cried aloud like a child Oh how he DID cry I HEAR it now and remember it as well as if it were but yesterday poor old man He thought God had done it all and my heart bled within me at the sight of his misery He begged me to get permission to come and see him sometimes which I readily and heartily promised him ' But when all had left him the Ardinburghs having some feeling left for their faithful and favorite slave 'took turns about' in keeping him permitting him to stay a few weeks at one house and then awhile at another and so around If when he made a removal the place where he was going was not too far off he took up his line of march staff in hand and asked for no assistance If it was twelve or twenty miles they gave him a ride While he was living in this way Isabella was twice permitted to visit him Another time she walked twelve miles and carried her infant in her arms to see him but when she reached the place where she hoped to find him he had just left for a place some twenty miles distant and she never saw him more The last time she did see him she found him seated on a rock by the road side alone and far from any house He was then migrating from the house of one Ardinburgh to that of another several miles distant His hair was white like wool he was almost blind and his gait was more a creep than a walk but the weather was warm and pleasant and he did not dislike the journey When Isabella addressed him he recognized her voice and was exceeding glad to see her He was assisted to mount the wagon was carried back to the famous cellar of which we have spoken and there they held their last earthly conversation He again as usual bewailed his loneliness spoke in tones of anguish of his many children saying 'They are all taken away from me I have now not one to give me a cup of cold water why should I live and not die ' Isabella whose heart yearned over her father and who would have made any sacrifice to have been able to be with and take care of him tried to comfort by telling him that 'she had heard the white folks say that all the slaves in the State would be freed in ten years and that then she would come and take care of him ' 'I would take just as good care of you as Mau mau would if she was here' continued Isabel 'Oh my child ' replied he 'I cannot live that long ' 'Oh do daddy do live and I will take such good care of you ' was her rejoinder She now says 'Why I thought then in my ignorance that he could live if he would I just as much thought so as I ever thought any thing in my life and I insisted on his living but he shook his head and insisted he could not ' But before Bomefree's good constitution would yield either to age exposure or a strong desire to die the Ardinburghs again tired of him and offered freedom to two old slaves Caesar brother of Mau mau Bett and his wife Betsey on condition that they should take care of James I was about to say 'their brother in law' but as slaves are neither husbands nor wives in law the idea of their being brothers in law is truly ludicrous And although they were too old and infirm to take care of themselves C sar having been afflicted for a long time with fever sores and his wife with the jaundice they eagerly accepted the boon of freedom which had been the life long desire of their souls though at a time when emancipation was to them little more than destitution and was a freedom more to be desired by the master than the slave Sojourner declares of the slaves in their ignorance that 'their thoughts are no longer than her finger ' DEATH OF BOMEFREE A rude cabin in a lone wood far from any neighbors was granted to our freed friends as the only assistance they were now to expect Bomefree from this time found his poor needs hardly supplied as his new providers were scarce able to administer to their own wants However the time drew near when things were to be decidedly worse rather than better for they had not been together long before Betty died and shortly after C sar followed her to 'that bourne from whence no traveller returns' leaving poor James again desolate and more helpless than ever before as this time there was no kind family in the house and the Ardinburghs no longer invited him to their homes Yet lone blind and helpless as he was James for a time lived on One day an aged colored woman named Soan called at his shanty and James besought her in the most moving manner even with tears to tarry awhile and wash and mend him up so that he might once more be decent and comfortable for he was suffering dreadfully with the filth and vermin that had collected upon him Soan was herself an emancipated slave old and weak with no one to care for her and she lacked the courage to undertake a job of such seeming magnitude fearing she might herself get sick and perish there without assistance and with great reluctance and a heart swelling with pity as she afterwards declared she felt obliged to leave him in his wretchedness and filth And shortly after her visit this faithful slave this deserted wreck of humanity was found on his miserable pallet frozen and stiff in death The kind angel had come at last and relieved him of the many miseries that his fellow man had heaped upon him Yes he had died chilled and starved with none to speak a kindly word or do a kindly deed for him in that last dread hour of need The news of his death reached the ears of John Ardinburgh a grandson of the old Colonel and he declared that 'Bomefree who had ever been a kind and faithful slave should now have a good funeral ' And now gentle reader what think you constituted a good funeral Answer some black paint for the coffin and a jug of ardent spirits What a compensation for a life of toil of patient submission to repeated robberies of the most aggravated kind and also far more than murderous neglect Mankind often vainly attempt to atone for unkindness or cruelty to the living by honoring the same after death but John Ardinburgh undoubtedly meant his pot of paint and jug of whisky should act as an opiate on his slaves rather than on his own seared conscience COMMENCEMENT OF ISABELLA'S TRIALS IN LIFE Having seen the sad end of her parents so far as it relates to this earthly life we will return with Isabella to that memorable auction which threatened to separate her father and mother A slave auction is a terrible affair to its victims and its incidents and consequences are graven on their hearts as with a pen of burning steel At this memorable time Isabella was struck off for the sum of one hundred dollars to one John Nealy of Ulster County New York and she has an impression that in this sale she was connected with a lot of sheep She was now nine years of age and her trials in life may be dated from this period She says with emphasis 'Now the war begun ' She could only talk Dutch and the Nealy's could only talk English Mr Nealy could understand Dutch but Isabel and her mistress could neither of them understand the language of the other and this of itself was a formidable obstacle in the way of a good understanding between them and for some time was a fruitful source of dissatisfaction to the mistress and of punishment and suffering to Isabella She says 'If they sent me for a frying pan not knowing what they meant perhaps I carried them the pot hooks and trammels Then oh how angry mistress would be with me ' Then she suffered 'terribly terribly ' with the cold During the winter her feet were badly frozen for want of proper covering They gave her a plenty to eat and also a plenty of whippings One Sunday morning in particular she was told to go to the barn on going there she found her master with a bundle of rods prepared in the embers and bound together with cords When he had tied her hands together before her he gave her the most cruel whipping she was ever tortured with He whipped her till the flesh was deeply lacerated and the blood streamed from her wounds and the scars remain to the present day to testify to the fact 'And now ' she says 'when I hear 'em tell of whipping women on the bare flesh it makes my flesh crawl and my very hair rise on my head Oh my God ' she continues 'what a way is this of treating human beings ' In these hours of her extremity she did not forget the instructions of her mother to go to God in all her trials and every affliction and she not only remembered but obeyed going to him 'and telling him all and asking him if he thought it was right ' and begging him to protect and shield her from her persecutors She always asked with an unwavering faith that she should receive just what she plead for 'And now ' she says 'though it seems curious I do not remember ever asking for any thing but what I got it And I always received it as an answer to my prayers When I got beaten I never knew it long enough beforehand to pray and I always thought if I only had had time to pray to God for help I should have escaped the beating ' She had no idea God had any knowledge of her thoughts save what she told him or heard her prayers unless they were spoken audibly And consequently she could not pray unless she had time and opportunity to go by herself where she could talk to God without being overheard TRIALS CONTINUED When she had been at Mr Nealy's several months she began to beg God most earnestly to send her father to her and as soon as she commenced to pray she began as confidently to look for his coming and ere it was long to her great joy he came She had no opportunity to speak to him of the troubles that weighed so heavily on her spirit while he remained but when he left she followed him to the gate and unburdened her heart to him inquiring if he could not do something to get her a new and better place In this way the slaves often assist each other by ascertaining who are kind to their slaves comparatively and then using their influence to get such an one to hire or buy their friends and masters often from policy as well as from latent humanity allow those they are about to sell or let to choose their own places if the persons they happen to select for masters are considered safe pay He promised to do all he could and they parted But every day as long as the snow lasted for there was snow on the ground at the time she returned to the spot where they separated and walking in the tracks her father had made in the snow repeated her prayer that 'God would help her father get her a new and better place ' A long time had not elapsed when a fisherman by the name of Scriver appeared at Mr Nealy's and inquired of Isabel 'if she would like to go and live with him ' She eagerly answered 'Yes ' nothing doubting but he was sent in answer to her prayer and she soon started off with him walking while he rode for he had bought her at the suggestion of her father paying one hundred and five dollars for her He also lived in Ulster County but some five or six miles from Mr Nealy's Scriver besides being a fisherman kept a tavern for the accommodation of people of his own class for his was a rude uneducated family exceedingly profane in their language but on the whole an honest kind and well disposed people They owned a large farm but left it wholly unimproved attending mainly to their vocations of fishing and inn keeping Isabella declares she can ill describe the life she led with them It was a wild out of door kind of life She was expected to carry fish to hoe corn to bring roots and herbs from the wood for beers go to the Strand for a gallon of molasses or liquor as the case might require and 'browse around ' as she expresses it It was a life that suited her well for the time being as devoid of hardship or terror as it was of improvement a need which had not yet become a want Instead of improving at this place morally she retrograded as their example taught her to curse and it was here that she took her first oath After living with them about a year and a half she was sold to one John J Dumont for the sum of seventy pounds This was in Mr Dumont lived in the same county as her former masters in the town of New Paltz and she remained with him till a short time previous to her emancipation by the State in HER STANDING WITH HER NEW MASTER AND MISTRESS Had Mrs Dumont possessed that vein of kindness and consideration for the slaves so perceptible in her husband's character Isabella would have been as comfortable here as one had best be if one must be a slave Mr Dumont had been nursed in the very lap of slavery and being naturally a man of kind feelings treated his slaves with all the consideration he did his other animals and more perhaps But Mrs Dumont who had been born and educated in a non slaveholding family and like many others used only to work people who under the most stimulating of human motives were willing to put forth their every energy could not have patience with the creeping gait the dull understanding or see any cause for the listless manners and careless slovenly habits of the poor down trodden outcast entirely forgetting that every high and efficient motive had been removed far from him and that had not his very intellect been crushed out of him the slave would find little ground for aught but hopeless despondency From this source arose a long series of trials in the life of our heroine which we must pass over in silence some from motives of delicacy and others because the relation of them might inflict undeserved pain on some now living whom Isabel remembers only with esteem and love therefore the reader will not be surprised if our narrative appear somewhat tame at this point and may rest assured that it is not for want of facts as the most thrilling incidents of this portion of her life are from various motives suppressed One comparatively trifling incident she wishes related as it made a deep impression on her mind at the time showing as she thinks how God shields the innocent and causes them to triumph over their enemies and also how she stood between master and mistress In her family Mrs Dumont employed two white girls one of whom named Kate evinced a disposition to 'lord it over' Isabel and in her emphatic language 'to grind her down ' Her master often shielded her from the attacks and accusations of others praising her for her readiness and ability to work and these praises seemed to foster a spirit of hostility to her in the minds of Mrs Dumont and her white servant the latter of whom took every opportunity to cry up her faults lessen her in the esteem of her master and increase against her the displeasure of her mistress which was already more than sufficient for Isabel's comfort Her master insisted that she could do as much work as half a dozen common people and do it well too whilst her mistress insisted that the first was true only because it ever came from her hand but half performed A good deal of feeling arose from this difference of opinion which was getting to rather an uncomfortable height when all at once the potatoes that Isabel cooked for breakfast assumed a dingy dirty look Her mistress blamed her severely asking her master to observe 'a fine specimen of Bell's work ' adding 'it is the way all her work is done ' Her master scolded also this time and commanded her to be more careful in future Kate joined with zest in the censures and was very hard upon her Isabella thought that she had done all she well could to have them nice and became quite distressed at these appearances and wondered what she should do to avoid them In this dilemma Gertrude Dumont Mr D 's eldest child a good kind hearted girl of ten years who pitied Isabel sincerely when she heard them all blame her so unsparingly came forward offering her sympathy and assistance and when about to retire to bed on the night of Isabella's humiliation she advanced to Isabel and told her if she would wake her early next morning she would get up and attend to her potatoes for her while she Isabella went to milking and they would see if they could not have them nice and not have 'Poppee ' her word for father and 'Matty ' her word for mother and all of 'em scolding so terribly Isabella gladly availed herself of this kindness which touched her to the heart amid so much of an opposite spirit When Isabella had put the potatoes over to boil Getty told her she would herself tend the fire while Isabel milked She had not long been seated by the fire in performance of her promise when Kate entered and requested Gertrude to go out of the room and do something for her which she refused still keeping her place in the corner While there Kate came sweeping about the fire caught up a chip lifted some ashes with it and dashed them into the kettle Now the mystery was solved the plot discovered Kate was working a little too fast at making her mistress's words good at showing that Mrs Dumont and herself were on the right side of the dispute and consequently at gaining power over Isabella Yes she was quite too fast inasmuch as she had overlooked the little figure of justice which sat in the corner with scales nicely balanced waiting to give all their dues But the time had come when she was to be overlooked no longer It was Getty's turn to speak now 'Oh Poppee oh Poppee ' said she 'Kate has been putting ashes in among the potatoes I saw her do it Look at those that fell on the outside of the kettle You can now see what made the potatoes so dingy every morning though Bell washed them clean ' And she repeated her story to every new comer till the fraud was made as public as the censure of Isabella had been Her mistress looked blank and remained dumb her master muttered something which sounded very like an oath and poor Kate was so chop fallen she looked like a convicted criminal who would gladly have hid herself now that the baseness was out to conceal her mortified pride and deep chagrin It was a fine triumph for Isabella and her master and she became more ambitious than ever to please him and he stimulated her ambition by his commendation and by boasting of her to his friends telling them that 'that wench' pointing to Isabel is better to me than a man for she will do a good family's washing in the night and be ready in the morning to go into the field where she will do as much at raking and binding as my best hands ' Her ambition and desire to please were so great that she often worked several nights in succession sleeping only short snatches as she sat in her chair and some nights she would not allow herself to take any sleep save what she could get resting herself against the wall fearing that if she sat down she would sleep too long These extra exertions to please and the praises consequent upon them brought upon her head the envy of her fellow slaves and they taunted her with being the 'white folks' nigger ' On the other hand she received a larger share of the confidence of her master and many small favors that were by them unattainable I asked her if her master Dumont ever whipped her She answered 'Oh yes he sometimes whipped me soundly though never cruelly And the most severe whipping he ever give me was because I was cruel to a cat 'At this time she looked upon her master as a God and believed that he knew of and could see her at all times even as God himself And she used sometimes to confess her delinquencies from the conviction that he already knew them and that she should fare better if she confessed voluntarily and if any one talked to her of the injustice of her being a slave she answered them with contempt and immediately told her master She then firmly believed that slavery was right and honorable Yet she now sees very clearly the false position they were all in both masters and slaves and she looks back with utter astonishment at the absurdity of the claims so arrogantly set up by the masters over beings designed by God to be as free as kings and at the perfect stupidity of the slave in admitting for one moment the validity of these claims In obedience to her mother's instructions she had educated herself to such a sense of honesty that when she had become a mother she would sometimes whip her child when it cried to her for bread rather than give it a piece secretly lest it should learn to take what was not its own And the writer of this knows from personal observation that the slaveholders of the South feel it to be a religious duty to teach their slaves to be honest and never to take what is not their own Oh consistency art thou not a jewel Yet Isabella glories in the fact that she was faithful and true to her master she says 'It made me true to my God' meaning that it helped to form in her a character that loved truth and hated a lie and had saved her from the bitter pains and fears that are sure to follow in the wake of insincerity and hypocrisy As she advanced in years an attachment sprung up between herself and a slave named Robert But his master an Englishman by the name of Catlin anxious that no one's property but his own should be enhanced by the increase of his slaves forbade Robert's visits to Isabella and commanded him to take a wife among his fellow servants Notwithstanding this interdiction Robert following the bent of his inclinations continued his visits to Isabel though very stealthily and as he believed without exciting the suspicion of his master but one Saturday afternoon hearing that Bell was ill he took the liberty to go and see her The first intimation she had of his visit was the appearance of her master inquiring 'if she had seen Bob ' On her answering in the negative he said to her 'If you see him tell him to take care of himself for the Catlins are after him ' Almost at that instant Bob made his appearance and the first people he met were his old and his young masters They were terribly enraged at finding him there and the eldest began cursing and calling upon his son to 'Knock down the d d black rascal ' at the same time they both fell upon him like tigers beating him with the heavy ends of their canes bruising and mangling his head and face in the most awful manner and causing the blood which streamed from his wounds to cover him like a slaughtered beast constituting him a most shocking spectacle Mr Dumont interposed at this point telling the ruffians they could no longer thus spill human blood on his premises he would have 'no niggers killed there ' The Catlins then took a rope they had taken with them for the purpose and tied Bob's hands behind him in such a manner that Mr Dumont insisted on loosening the cord declaring that no brute should be tied in that manner where he was And as they led him away like the greatest of criminals the more humane Dumont followed them to their homes as Robert's protector and when he returned he kindly went to Bell as he called her telling her he did not think they would strike him any more as their wrath had greatly cooled before he left them Isabella had witnessed this scene from her window and was greatly shocked at the murderous treatment of poor Robert whom she truly loved and whose only crime in the eye of his persecutors was his affection for her This beating and we know not what after treatment completely subdued the spirit of its victim for Robert ventured no more to visit Isabella but like an obedient and faithful chattel took himself a wife from the house of his master Robert did not live many years after his last visit to Isabel but took his departure to that country where 'they neither marry nor are given in marriage ' and where the oppressor cannot molest ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE Subsequently Isabella was married to a fellow slave named Thomas who had previously had two wives one of whom if not both had been torn from him and sold far away And it is more than probable that he was not only allowed but encouraged to take another at each successive sale I say it is probable because the writer of this knows from personal observation that such is the custom among slaveholders at the present day and that in a twenty months' residence among them we never knew any one to open the lip against the practice and when we severely censured it the slaveholder had nothing to say and the slave pleaded that under existing circumstances he could do no better Such an abominable state of things is silently tolerated to say the least by slaveholders deny it who may And what is that religion that sanctions even by its silence all that is embraced in the 'Peculiar Institution ' If there can be any thing more diametrically opposed to the religion of Jesus than the working of this soul killing system which is as truly sanctioned by the religion of America as are her ministers and churches we wish to be shown where it can be found We have said Isabella was married to Thomas she was after the fashion of slavery one of the slaves performing the ceremony for them as no true minister of Christ can perform as in the presence of God what he knows to be a mere farce a mock marriage unrecognized by any civil law and liable to be annulled any moment when the interest or caprice of the master should dictate With what feelings must slaveholders expect us to listen to their horror of amalgamation in prospect while they are well aware that we know how calmly and quietly they contemplate the present state of licentiousness their own wicked laws have created not only as it regards the slave but as it regards the more privileged portion of the population of the South Slaveholders appear to me to take the same notice of the vices of the slave as one does of the vicious disposition of his horse They are often an inconvenience further than that they care not to trouble themselves about the matter ISABELLA AS A MOTHER In process of time Isabella found herself the mother of five children and she rejoiced in being permitted to be the instrument of increasing the property of her oppressors Think dear reader without a blush if you can for one moment of a mother thus willingly and with pride laying her own children the 'flesh of her flesh ' on the altar of slavery a sacrifice to the bloody Moloch But we must remember that beings capable of such sacrifices are not mothers they are only 'things ' 'chattels ' 'property ' But since that time the subject of this narrative has made some advances from a state of chattelism towards that of a woman and a mother and she now looks back upon her thoughts and feelings there in her state of ignorance and degradation as one does on the dark imagery of a fitful dream One moment it seems but a frightful illusion again it appears a terrible reality I would to God it were but a dreamy myth and not as it now stands a horrid reality to some three millions of chattelized human beings I have already alluded to her care not to teach her children to steal by her example and she says with groanings that cannot be written 'The Lord only knows how many times I let my children go hungry rather than take secretly the bread I liked not to ask for ' All parents who annul their preceptive teachings by their daily practices would do well to profit by her example Another proof of her master's kindness of heart is found in the following fact If her master came into the house and found her infant crying as she could not always attend to its wants and the commands of her mistress at the same time he would turn to his wife with a look of reproof and ask her why she did not see the child taken care of saying most earnestly 'I will not hear this crying I can't bear it and I will not hear any child cry so Here Bell take care of this child if no more work is done for a week ' And he would linger to see if his orders were obeyed and not countermanded When Isabella went to the field to work she used to put her infant in a basket tying a rope to each handle and suspending the basket to a branch of a tree set another small child to swing it It was thus secure from reptiles and was easily administered to and even lulled to sleep by a child too young for other labors I was quite struck with the ingenuity of such a baby tender as I have sometimes been with the swinging hammock the native mother prepares for her sick infant apparently so much easier than aught we have in our more civilized homes easier for the child because it gets the motion without the least jar and easier for the nurse because the hammock is strung so high as to supersede the necessity of stooping SLAVEHOLDER'S PROMISES After emancipation had been decreed by the State some years before the time fixed for its consummation Isabella's master told her if she would do well and be faithful he would give her 'free papers ' one year before she was legally free by statute In the year she had a badly diseased hand which greatly diminished her usefulness but on the arrival of July the time specified for her receiving her 'free papers ' she claimed the fulfilment of her master's promise but he refused granting it on account as he alleged of the loss he had sustained by her hand She plead that she had worked all the time and done many things she was not wholly able to do although she knew she had been less useful than formerly but her master remained inflexible Her very faithfulness probably operated against her now and he found it less easy than he thought to give up the profits of his faithful Bell who had so long done him efficient service But Isabella inwardly determined that she would remain quietly with him only until she had spun his wool about one hundred pounds and then she would leave him taking the rest of the time to herself 'Ah ' she says with emphasis that cannot be written 'the slaveholders are TERRIBLE for promising to give you this or that or such and such a privilege if you will do thus and so and when the time of fulfilment comes and one claims the promise they forsooth recollect nothing of the kind and you are like as not taunted with being a LIAR or at best the slave is accused of not having performed his part or condition of the contract ' 'Oh ' said she 'I have felt as if I could not live through the operation sometimes Just think of us so eager for our pleasures and just foolish enough to keep feeding and feeding ourselves up with the idea that we should get what had been thus fairly promised and when we think it is almost in our hands find ourselves flatly denied Just think how could we bear it Why there was Charles Brodhead promised his slave Ned that when harvesting was over he might go and see his wife who lived some twenty or thirty miles off So Ned worked early and late and as soon as the harvest was all in he claimed the promised boon His master said he had merely told him he 'would see if he could go when the harvest was over but now he saw that he could not go ' But Ned who still claimed a positive promise on which he had fully depended went on cleaning his shoes His master asked him if he intended going and on his replying 'yes ' took up a sled stick that lay near him and gave him such a blow on the head as broke his skull killing him dead on the spot The poor colored people all felt struck down by the blow ' Ah and well they might Yet it was but one of a long series of bloody and other most effectual blows struck against their liberty and their lives Yet no official notice was taken of this more than brutal murder But to return from our digression The subject of this narrative was to have been free July but she continued with her master till the wool was spun and the heaviest of the 'fall's work' closed up when she concluded to take her freedom into her own hands and seek her fortune in some other place HER ESCAPE The question in her mind and one not easily solved now was 'How can I get away ' So as was her usual custom she 'told God she was afraid to go in the night and in the day every body would see her ' At length the thought came to her that she could leave just before the day dawned and get out of the neighborhood where she was known before the people were much astir 'Yes ' said she fervently 'that's a good thought Thank you God for that thought ' So receiving it as coming direct from God she acted upon it and one fine morning a little before day break she might have been seen stepping stealthily away from the rear of Master Dumont's house her infant on one arm and her wardrobe on the other the bulk and weight of which probably she never found so convenient as on the present occasion a cotton handkerchief containing both her clothes and her provisions As she gained the summit of a high hill a considerable distance from her master's the sun offended her by coming forth in all his pristine splendor She thought it never was so light before indeed she thought it much too light She stopped to look about her and ascertain if her pursuers were yet in sight No one appeared and for the first time the question came up for settlement 'Where and to whom shall I go ' In all her thoughts of getting away she had not once asked herself whither she should direct her steps She sat down fed her infant and again turning her thoughts to God her only help she prayed him to direct her to some safe asylum And soon it occurred to her that there was a man living somewhere in the direction she had been pursuing by the name of Levi Rowe whom she had known and who she thought would be likely to befriend her She accordingly pursued her way to his house where she found him ready to entertain and assist her though he was then on his death bed He bade her partake of the hospitalities of his house said he knew of two good places where she might get in and requested his wife to show her where they were to be found As soon as she came in sight of the first house she recollected having seen it and its inhabitants before and instantly exclaimed 'That's the place for me I shall stop there ' She went there and found the good people of the house Mr and Mrs Van Wagener absent but was kindly received and hospitably entertained by their excellent mother till the return of her children When they arrived she made her case known to them They listened to her story assuring her they never turned the needy away and willingly gave her employment She had not been there long before her old master Dumont appeared as she had anticipated for when she took French leave of him she resolved not to go too far from him and not put him to as much trouble in looking her up for the latter he was sure to do as Tom and Jack had done when they ran away from him a short time before This was very considerate in her to say the least and a proof that 'like begets like ' He had often considered her feelings though not always and she was equally considerate When her master saw her he said 'Well Bell so you've run away from me ' 'No I did not run away I walked away by day light and all because you had promised me a year of my time ' His reply was 'You must go back with me ' Her decisive answer was 'No I won't go back with you ' He said 'Well I shall take the child ' This also was as stoutly negatived Mr Isaac S Van Wagener then interposed saying he had never been in the practice of buying and selling slaves he did not believe in slavery but rather than have Isabella taken back by force he would buy her services for the balance of the year for which her master charged twenty dollars and five in addition for the child The sum was paid and her master Dumont departed but not till he had heard Mr Van Wagener tell her not to call him master adding 'there is but one master and he who is your master is my master ' Isabella inquired what she should call him He answered 'Call me Isaac Van Wagener and my wife is Maria Van Wagener ' Isabella could not understand this and thought it a mighty change as it most truly was from a master whose word was law to simple Isaac S Van Wagener who was master to no one With these noble people who though they could not be the masters of slaves were undoubtedly a portion of God's nobility she resided one year and from them she derived the name of Van Wagener he being her last master in the eye of the law and a slave's surname is ever the same as his master that is if he is allowed to have any other name than Tom Jack or Guffin Slaves have sometimes been severely punished for adding their master's name to their own But when they have no particular title to it it is no particular offence ILLEGAL SALE OF HER SON A little previous to Isabel's leaving her old master he had sold her child a boy of five years to a Dr Gedney who took him with him as far as New York city on his way to England but finding the boy too small for his service he sent him back to his brother Solomon Gedney This man disposed of him to his sister's husband a wealthy planter by the name of Fowler who took him to his own home in Alabama This illegal and fraudulent transaction had been perpetrated some months before Isabella knew of it as she was now living at Mr Van Wagener's The law expressly prohibited the sale of any slave out of the State and all minors were to be free at twenty one years of age and Mr Dumont had sold Peter with the express understanding that he was soon to return to the State of New York and be emancipated at the specified time When Isabel heard that her son had been sold South she immediately started on foot and alone to find the man who had thus dared in the face of all law human and divine to sell her child out of the State and if possible to bring him to account for the deed Arriving at New Paltz she went directly to her former mistress Dumont complaining bitterly of the removal of her son Her mistress heard her through and then replied 'Ugh a fine fuss to make about a little nigger Why have n't you as many of 'em left as you can see to and take care of A pity 'tis the niggers are not all in Guinea Making such a halloo balloo about the neighborhood and all for a paltry nigger ' Isabella heard her through and after a moment's hesitation answered in tones of deep determination 'I'll have my child again ' 'Have your child again ' repeated her mistress her tones big with contempt and scorning the absurd idea of her getting him 'How can you get him And what have you to support him with if you could Have you any money ' 'No ' answered Bell 'I have no money but God has enough or what's better And I'll have my child again ' These words were pronounced in the most slow solemn and determined measure and manner And in speaking of it she says 'Oh my God I know'd I'd have him agin I was sure God would help me to get him Why I felt so tall within I felt as if the power of a nation was with me ' The impressions made by Isabella on her auditors when moved by lofty or deep feeling can never be transmitted to paper to use the words of another till by some Daguerrian act we are enabled to transfer the look the gesture the tones of voice in connection with the quaint yet fit expressions used and the spirit stirring animation that at such a time pervades all she says After leaving her mistress she called on Mrs Gedney mother of him who had sold her boy who after listening to her lamentations her grief being mingled with indignation at the sale of her son and her declaration that she would have him again said 'Dear me What a disturbance to make about your child What is your child better than my child My child is gone out there and yours is gone to live with her to have enough of every thing and to be treated like a gentleman ' And here she laughed at Isabel's absurd fears as she would represent them to be 'Yes ' said Isabel 'your child has gone there but she is married and my boy has gone as a slave and he is too little to go so far from his mother Oh I must have my child ' And here the continued laugh of Mrs G seemed to Isabel in this time of anguish and distress almost demoniacal And well it was for Mrs Gedney that at that time she could not even dream of the awful fate awaiting her own beloved daughter at the hands of him whom she had chosen as worthy the wealth of her love and confidence and in whose society her young heart had calculated on a happiness purer and more elevated than was ever conferred by a kingly crown But alas she was doomed to disappointment as we shall relate by and by At this point Isabella earnestly begged of God that he would show those about her that he was her helper and she adds in narrating 'And he did or if he did not show them he did me ' IT IS OFTEN DARKEST JUST BEFORE DAWN This homely proverb was illustrated in the case of our sufferer for at the period at which we have arrived in our narrative to her the darkness seemed palpable and the waters of affliction covered her soul yet light was about to break in upon her Soon after the scenes related in our last which had harrowed up her very soul to agony she met a man we would like to tell you who dear reader but it would be doing him no kindness even at the present day to do so who evidently sympathized with her and counselled her to go to the Quakers telling her they were already feeling very indignant at the fraudulent sale of her son and assuring that they would readily assist her and direct her what to do He pointed out to her two houses where lived some of those people who formerly more than any other sect perhaps lived out the principles of the gospel of Christ She wended her way to their dwellings was listened to unknown as she personally was to them with patience and soon gained their sympathies and active cooperation They gave her lodgings for the night and it is very amusing to hear her tell of the 'nice high clean white beautiful bed' assigned her to sleep in which contrasted so strangely with her former pallets that she sat down and contemplated it perfectly absorbed in wonder that such a bed should have been appropriated to one like herself For some time she thought that she would lie down beneath it on her usual bedstead the floor 'I did indeed ' says she laughing heartily at her former self However she finally concluded to make use of the bed for fear that not to do so might injure the feelings of her good hostess In the morning the Quaker saw that she was taken and set down near Kingston with directions to go to the Court House and enter complaint to the grand jury By a little inquiry she found which was the building she sought went into the door and taking the first man she saw of imposing appearance for the grand jury she commenced her complaint But he very civilly informed her there was no grand jury there she must go up stairs When she had with some difficulty ascended the flight through the crowd that filled them she again turned to the 'grandest' looking man she could select telling him she had come to enter a complaint to the grand jury For his own amusement he inquired what her complaint was but when he saw it was a serious matter he said to her 'This is no place to enter a complaint go in there ' pointing in a particular direction She then went in where she found the Grand Jurors indeed sitting and again commenced to relate her injuries After holding some conversation among themselves one of them rose and bidding her follow him led the way to a side office where he heard her story and asked her 'if she could swear that the child she spoke of was her son ' 'Yes ' she answered 'I swear it's my son ' 'Stop stop ' said the lawyer 'you must swear by this book' giving her a book which she thinks must have been the Bible She took it and putting it to her lips began again to swear it was her child The clerks unable to preserve their gravity any longer burst into an uproarious laugh and one of them inquired of lawyer Chip of what use it could be to make her swear 'It will answer the law ' replied the officer He then made her comprehend just what he wished her to do and she took a lawful oath as far as the outward ceremony could make it one All can judge how far she understood its spirit and meaning He now gave her a writ directing her to take it to the constable of New Paltz and have him serve it on Solomon Gedney She obeyed walking or rather trotting in her haste some eight or nine miles But while the constable through mistake served the writ on a brother of the real culprit Solomon Gedney slipped into a boat and was nearly across the North River on whose banks they were standing before the dull Dutch constable was aware of his mistake Solomon Gedney meanwhile consulted a lawyer who advised him to go to Alabama and bring back the boy otherwise it might cost him fourteen years' imprisonment and a thousand dollars in cash By this time it is hoped he began to feel that selling slaves unlawfully was not so good a business as he had wished to find it He secreted himself till preparations could be made and soon set sail for Alabama Steamboats and railroads had not then annihilated distance to the extent they now have and although he left in the fall of the year spring came ere he returned bringing the boy with him but holding on to him as his property It had ever been Isabella's prayer not only that her son might be returned but that he should be delivered from bondage and into her own hands lest he should be punished out of mere spite to her who was so greatly annoying and irritating to her oppressors and if her suit was gained her very triumph would add vastly to their irritation She again sought advice of Esquire Chip whose counsel was that the aforesaid constable serve the before mentioned writ upon the right person This being done soon brought Solomon Gedney up to Kingston where he gave bonds for his appearance at court in the sum of Esquire Chip next informed his client that her case must now lie over till the next session of the court some months in the future 'The law must take its course ' said he 'What wait another court wait months ' said the persevering mother 'Why long before that time he can go clear off and take my child with him no one knows where I cannot wait I must have him now whilst he is to be had ' 'Well ' said the lawyer very coolly 'if he puts the boy out of the way he must pay the one half of which will be yours ' supposing perhaps that would pay for a 'heap of children ' in the eye of a slave who never in all her life called a dollar her own But in this instance he was mistaken in his reckoning She assured him that she had not been seeking money neither would money satisfy her it was her son and her son alone she wanted and her son she must have Neither could she wait court not she The lawyer used his every argument to convince her that she ought to be very thankful for what they had done for her that it was a great deal and it was but reasonable that she should now wait patiently the time of the court Yet she never felt for a moment like being influenced by these suggestions She felt confident she was to receive a full and literal answer to her prayer the burden of which had been 'O Lord give my son into my hands and that speedily Let not the spoilers have him any longer ' Notwithstanding she very distinctly saw that those who had thus far helped her on so kindly were wearied of her and she feared God was wearied also She had a short time previous learned that Jesus was a Savior and an intercessor and she thought that if Jesus could but be induced to plead for her in the present trial God would listen to him though he were wearied of her importunities To him of course she applied As she was walking about scarcely knowing whither she went asking within herself 'Who will show me any good and lend a helping hand in this matter ' she was accosted by a perfect stranger and one whose name she has never learned in the following terms 'Halloo there how do you get along with your boy do they give him up to you ' She told him all adding that now every body was tired and she had none to help her He said 'Look here I'll tell you what you'd better do Do you see that stone house yonder ' pointing in a particular direction 'Well lawyer Demain lives there and do you go to him and lay your case before him I think he'll help you Stick to him Don't give him peace till he does I feel sure if you press him he'll do it for you ' She needed no further urging but trotted off at her peculiar gait in the direction of his house as fast as possible and she was not encumbered with stockings shoes or any other heavy article of dress When she had told him her story in her impassioned manner he looked at her a few moments as if to ascertain if he were contemplating a new variety of the genus homo and then told her if she would give him five dollars he would get her son for her in twenty four hours 'Why ' she replied 'I have no money and never had a dollar in my life ' Said he 'If you will go to those Quakers in Poppletown who carried you to court they will help you to five dollars in cash I have no doubt and you shall have your son in twenty four hours from the time you bring me that sum ' She performed the journey to Poppletown a distance of some ten miles very expeditiously collected considerable more than the sum specified by the barrister then shutting the money tightly in her hand she trotted back and paid the lawyer a larger fee than he had demanded When inquired of by people what she had done with the overplus she answered 'Oh I got it for lawyer Demain and I gave it to him ' They assured her she was a fool to do so that she should have kept all over five dollars and purchased herself shoes with it 'Oh I do not want money or clothes now I only want my son and if five dollars will get him more will surely get him ' And if the lawyer had returned it to her she avers she would not have accepted it She was perfectly willing he should have every coin she could raise if he would but restore her lost son to her Moreover the five dollars he required were for the remuneration of him who should go after her son and his master and not for his own services The lawyer now renewed his promise that she should have her son in twenty four hours But Isabella having no idea of this space of time went several times in a day to ascertain if her son had come Once when the servant opened the door and saw her she said in a tone expressive of much surprise 'Why this woman's come again ' She then wondered if she went too often When the lawyer appeared he told her the twenty four hours would not expire till the next morning if she would call then she would see her son The next morning saw Isabel at the lawyer's door while he was yet in his bed He now assured her it was morning till noon and that before noon her son would be there for he had sent the famous 'Matty Styles' after him who would not fail to have the boy and his master on hand in due season either dead or alive of that he was sure Telling her she need not come again he would himself inform her of their arrival After dinner he appeared at Mr Rutzer's a place the lawyer had procured for her while she awaited the arrival of her boy assuring her her son had come but that he stoutly denied having any mother or any relatives in that place and said 'she must go over and identify him ' She went to the office but at sight of her the boy cried aloud and regarded her as some terrible being who was about to take him away from a kind and loving friend He knelt even and begged them with tears not to take him away from his dear master who had brought him from the dreadful South and been so kind to him When he was questioned relative to the bad scar on his forehead he said 'Fowler's horse hove him ' And of the one on his cheek 'That was done by running against the carriage ' In answering these questions he looked imploringly at his master as much as to say 'If they are falsehoods you bade me say them may they be satisfactory to you at least ' The justice noting his appearance bade him forget his master and attend only to him But the boy persisted in denying his mother and clinging to his master saying his mother did not live in such a place as that However they allowed the mother to identify her son and Esquire Demain pleaded that he claimed the boy for her on the ground that he had been sold out of the State contrary to the laws in such cases made and provided spoke of the penalties annexed to said crime and of the sum of money the delinquent was to pay in case any one chose to prosecute him for the offence he had committed Isabella who was sitting in a corner scarcely daring to breathe thought within herself 'If I can but get the boy the may remain for whoever else chooses to prosecute I have done enough to make myself enemies already' and she trembled at the thought of the formidable enemies she had probably arrayed against herself helpless and despised as she was When the pleading was at an end Isabella understood the Judge to declare as the sentence of the Court that the 'boy be delivered into the hands of the mother having no other master no other controller no other conductor but his mother ' This sentence was obeyed he was delivered into her hands the boy meanwhile begging most piteously not to be taken from his dear master saying she was not his mother and that his mother did not live in such a place as that And it was some time before lawyer Demain the clerks and Isabella could collectively succeed in calming the child's fears and in convincing him that Isabella was not some terrible monster as he had for the last months probably been trained to believe and who in taking him away from his master was taking him from all good and consigning him to all evil When at last kind words and bon bons had quieted his fears and he could listen to their explanations he said to Isabella 'Well you do look like my mother used to ' and she was soon able to make him comprehend some of the obligations he was under and the relation he stood in both to herself and his master She commenced as soon as practicable to examine the boy and found to her utter astonishment that from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot the callosities and indurations on his entire body were most frightful to behold His back she described as being like her fingers as she laid them side by side 'Heavens what is all this ' said Isabel He answered 'It is where Fowler whipped kicked and beat me ' She exclaimed 'Oh Lord Jesus look see my poor child Oh Lord render unto them double for all this Oh my God Pete how did you bear it ' 'Oh this is nothing mammy if you should see Phillis I guess you'd scare She had a little baby and Fowler cut her till the milk as well as blood ran down her body You would scare to see Phillis mammy ' When Isabella inquired 'What did Miss Eliza Meaning Mrs Eliza Fowler say Pete when you were treated so badly ' he replied 'Oh mammy she said she wished I was with Bell Sometimes I crawled under the stoop mammy the blood running all about me and my back would stick to the boards and sometimes Miss Eliza would come and grease my sores when all were abed and asleep ' DEATH OF MRS ELIZA FOWLER As soon as possible she procured a place for Peter as tender of Locks at a place called Wahkendall near Greenkills After he was thus disposed of she visited her sister Sophia who resided at Newberg and spent the winter in several different families where she was acquainted She remained some time in the family of a Mr Latin who was a visiting relative of Solomon Gedney and the latter when he found Isabel with his cousin used all his influence to persuade him she was a great mischief maker and a very troublesome person that she had put him to some hundreds of dollars expense by fabricating lies about him and especially his sister and her family concerning her boy when the latter was living so like a gentleman with them and for his part he would not advise his friends to harbor or encourage her However his cousins the Latins could not see with the eyes of his feelings and consequently his words fell powerless on them and they retained her in their service as long as they had aught for her to do She then went to visit her former master Dumont She had scarcely arrived there when Mr Fred Waring entered and seeing Isabel pleasantly accosted her and asked her 'what she was driving at now a days ' On her answering 'nothing particular ' he requested her to go over to his place and assist his folks as some of them were sick and they needed an extra hand She very gladly assented When Mr W retired her master wanted to know why she wished to help people that called her the 'worst of devils ' as Mr Waring had done in the courthouse for he was the uncle of Solomon Gedney and attended the trial we have described and declared 'that she was a fool to he would n't do it ' 'Oh ' she told him 'she would not mind that but was very glad to have people forget their anger towards her ' She went over but too happy to feel that their resentment was passed and commenced her work with a light heart and a strong will She had not worked long in this frame of mind before a young daughter of Mr Waring rushed into the room exclaiming with uplifted hands 'Heavens and earth Isabella Fowler's murdered Cousin Eliza ' 'Ho ' said Isabel 'that's nothing he liked to have killed my child nothing saved him but God ' Meaning that she was not at all surprised at it for a man whose heart was sufficiently hardened to treat a mere child as hers had been treated was in her opinion more fiend than human and prepared for the commission of any crime that his passions might prompt him to The child further informed her that a letter had arrived by mail bringing the news Immediately after this announcement Solomon Gedney and his mother came in going direct to Mrs Waring's room where she soon heard tones as of some one reading She thought something said to her inwardly 'Go up stairs and hear ' At first she hesitated but it seemed to press her the more 'Go up and hear ' She went up unusual as it is for slaves to leave their work and enter unbidden their mistress's room for the sole purpose of seeing or hearing what may be seen or heard there But on this occasion Isabella says she walked in at the door shut it placed her back against it and listened She saw them and heard them read 'He knocked her down with his fist jumped on her with his knees broke her collarbone and tore out her wind pipe He then attempted his escape but was pursued and arrested and put in an iron bank for safekeeping ' And the friends were requested to go down and take away the poor innocent children who had thus been made in one short day more than orphans If this narrative should ever meet the eye of those innocent sufferers for another's guilt let them not be too deeply affected by the relation but placing their confidence in Him who sees the end from the beginning and controls the results rest secure in the faith that although they may physically suffer for the sins of others if they remain but true to themselves their highest and more enduring interests can never suffer from such a cause This relation should be suppressed for their sakes were it not even now so often denied that slavery is fast undermining all true regard for human life We know this one instance is not a demonstration to the contrary but adding this to the lists of tragedies that weekly come up to us through the Southern mails may we not admit them as proofs irrefragable The newspapers confirm this account of the terrible affair When Isabella had heard the letter all being too much absorbed in their own feelings to take note of her she returned to her work her heart swelling with conflicting emotions She was awed at the dreadful deed she mourned the fate of the loved Eliza who had in such an undeserved and barbarous manner been put away from her labors and watchings as a tender mother and 'last though not least ' in the development of her character and spirit her heart bled for the afflicted relatives even those of them who 'laughed at her calamity and mocked when her fear came ' Her thoughts dwelt long and intently on the subject and the wonderful chain of events that had conspired to bring her that day to that house to listen to that piece of intelligence to that house where she never was before or afterwards in her life and invited there by people who had so lately been hotly incensed against her It all seemed very remarkable to her and she viewed it as flowing from a special providence of God She thought she saw clearly that their unnatural bereavement was a blow dealt in retributive justice but she found it not in her heart to exult or rejoice over them She felt as if God had more than answered her petition when she ejaculated in her anguish of mind 'Oh Lord render unto them double ' She said 'I dared not find fault with God exactly but the language of my heart was 'Oh my God that's too much I did not mean quite so much God ' It was a terrible blow to the friends of the deceased and her selfish mother who said Isabella made such a 'to do about her boy not from affection 'but to have her own will and way' went deranged and walking to and fro in her delirium called aloud for her poor murdered daughter 'Eliza Eliza ' The derangement of Mrs G was a matter of hearsay as Isabella saw her not after the trial but she has no reason to doubt the truth of what she heard Isabel could never learn the subsequent fate of Fowler but heard in the spring of ' that his children had been seen in Kingston one of whom was spoken of as a fine interesting girl albeit a halo of sadness fell like a veil about her ISABELLA'S RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE We will now turn from the outward and temporal to the inward and spiritual life of our subject It is ever both interesting and instructive to trace the exercises of a human mind through the trials and mysteries of life and especially a naturally powerful mind left as hers was almost entirely to its own workings and the chance influences it met on its way and especially to note its reception of that divine 'light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world ' We see as knowledge dawns upon it truth and error strangely commingled here a bright spot illuminated by truth and there one darkened and distorted by error and the state of such a soul may be compared to a landscape at early dawn where the sun is seen superbly gilding some objects and causing others to send forth their lengthened distorted and sometimes hideous shadows Her mother as we have already said talked to her of God From these conversations her incipient mind drew the conclusion that God was 'a great man ' greatly superior to other men in power and being located 'high in the sky ' could see all that transpired on the earth She believed he not only saw but noted down all her actions in a great book even as her master kept a record of whatever he wished not to forget But she had no idea that God knew a thought of hers till she had uttered it aloud As we have before mentioned she had ever been mindful of her mother's injunctions spreading out in detail all her troubles before God imploring and firmly trusting him to send her deliverance from them Whilst yet a child she listened to a story of a wounded soldier left alone in the trail of a flying army helpless and starving who hardened the very ground about him with kneeling in his supplications to God for relief until it arrived From this narrative she was deeply impressed with the idea that if she also were to present her petitions under the open canopy of heaven speaking very loud she should the more readily be heard consequently she sought a fitting spot for this her rural sanctuary The place she selected in which to offer up her daily orisons was a small island in a small stream covered with large willow shrubbery beneath which the sheep had made their pleasant winding paths and sheltering themselves from the scorching rays of a noon tide sun luxuriated in the cool shadows of the graceful willows as they listened to the tiny falls of the silver waters It was a lonely spot and chosen by her for its beauty its retirement and because she thought that there in the noise of those waters she could speak louder to God without being overheard by any who might pass that way When she had made choice of her sanctum at a point of the island where the stream met after having been separated she improved it by pulling away the branches of the shrubs from the centre and weaving them together for a wall on the outside forming a circular arched alcove made entirely of the graceful willow To this place she resorted daily and in pressing times much more frequently At this time her prayers or more appropriately 'talks with God ' were perfectly original and unique and would be well worth preserving were it possible to give the tones and manner with the words but no adequate idea of them can be written while the tones and manner remain inexpressible She would sometimes repeat 'Our Father in heaven ' in her Low Dutch as taught her by her mother after that all was from the suggestions of her own rude mind She related to God in minute detail all her troubles and sufferings inquiring as she proceeded 'Do you think that's right God ' and closed by begging to be delivered from the evil whatever it might be She talked to God as familiarly as if he had been a creature like herself and a thousand times more so than if she had been in the presence of some earthly potentate She demanded with little expenditure of reverence or fear a supply of all her more pressing wants and at times her demands approached very near to commands She felt as if God was under obligation to her much more than she was to him He seemed to her benighted vision in some manner bound to do her bidding Her heart recoils now with very dread when she recalls these shocking almost blasphemous conversations with the great Jehovah And well for herself did she deem it that unlike earthly potentates his infinite character combined the tender father with the omniscient and omnipotent Creator of the universe She at first commenced promising God that if he would help her out of all her difficulties she would pay him by being very good and this goodness she intended as a remuneration to God She could think of no benefit that was to accrue to herself or her fellow creatures from her leading a life of purity and generous self sacrifice for the good of others as far as any but God was concerned she saw nothing in it but heart trying penance sustained by the sternest exertion and this she soon found much more easily promised than performed Days wore away new trials came God's aid was invoked and the same promises repeated and every successive night found her part of the contract unfulfilled She now began to excuse herself by telling God she could not be good in her present circumstances but if he would give her a new place and a good master and mistress she could and would be good and she expressly stipulated that she would be good one day to show God how good she would be all of the time when he should surround her with the right influences and she should be delivered from the temptations that then so sorely beset her But alas when night came and she became conscious that she had yielded to all her temptations and entirely failed of keeping her word with God having prayed and promised one hour and fallen into the sins of anger and profanity the next the mortifying reflection weighed on her mind and blunted her enjoyment Still she did not lay it deeply to heart but continued to repeat her demands for aid and her promises of pay with full purpose of heart at each particular time that that day she would not fail to keep her plighted word Thus perished the inward spark like a flame just igniting when one waits to see whether it will burn on or die out till the long desired change came and she found herself in a new place with a good mistress and one who never instigated an otherwise kind master to be unkind to her in short a place where she had literally nothing to complain of and where for a time she was more happy than she could well express 'Oh every thing there was so pleasant and kind and good and all so comfortable enough of every thing indeed it was beautiful ' she exclaimed Here at Mr Van Wagener's as the reader will readily perceive she must have been she was so happy and satisfied that God was entirely forgotten Why should her thoughts turn to Him who was only known to her as a help in trouble She had no trouble now her every prayer had been answered in every minute particular She had been delivered from her persecutors and temptations her youngest child had been given her and the others she knew she had no means of sustaining if she had them with her and was content to leave them behind Their father who was much older than Isabel and who preferred serving his time out in slavery to the trouble and dangers of the course she pursued remained with and could keep an eye on them though it is comparatively little that they can do for each other while they remain in slavery and this little the slave like persons in every other situation of life is not always disposed to perform There are slaves who copying the selfishness of their superiors in power in their conduct towards their fellows who may be thrown upon their mercy by infirmity or illness allow them to suffer for want of that kindness and care which it is fully in their power to render them The slaves in this country have ever been allowed to celebrate the principal if not some of the lesser festivals observed by the Catholics and Church of England many of them not being required to do the least service for several days and at Christmas they have almost universally an entire week to themselves except perhaps the attending to a few duties which are absolutely required for the comfort of the families they belong to If much service is desired they are hired to do it and paid for it as if they were free The more sober portion of them spend these holidays in earning a little money Most of them visit and attend parties and balls and not a few of them spend it in the lowest dissipation This respite from toil is granted them by all religionists of whatever persuasion and probably originated from the fact that many of the first slaveholders were members of the Church of England Frederick Douglass who has devoted his great heart and noble talents entirely to the furtherance of the cause of his down trodden race has said 'From what I know of the effect of their holidays upon the slave I believe them to be among the most effective means in the hands of the slaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection Were the slaveholders at once to abandon this practice I have not the slightest doubt it would lead to an immediate insurrection among the slaves These holidays serve as conductors or safety valves to carry off the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity But for these the slave would be forced up to the wildest desperation and woe betide the slaveholder the day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation of those conductors I warn him that in such an event a spirit will go forth in their midst more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake ' When Isabella had been at Mr Van Wagener's a few months she saw in prospect one of the festivals approaching She knows it by none but the Dutch name Pingster as she calls it but I think it must have been Whitsuntide in English She says she 'looked back into Egypt ' and everything looked 'so pleasant there ' as she saw retrospectively all her former companions enjoying their freedom for at least a little space as well as their wonted convivialities and in her heart she longed to be with them With this picture before her mind's eye she contrasted the quiet peaceful life she was living with the excellent people of Wahkendall and it seemed so dull and void of incident that the very contrast served but to heighten her desire to return that at least she might enjoy with them once more the coming festivities These feelings had occupied a secret corner of her breast for some time when one morning she told Mrs Van Wagener that her old master Dumont would come that day and that she should go home with him on his return They expressed some surprise and asked her where she obtained her information She replied that no one had told her but she felt that he would come It seemed to have been one of those 'events that cast their shadows before ' for before night Mr Dumont made his appearance She informed him of her intention to accompany him home He answered with a smile 'I shall not take you back again you ran away from me ' Thinking his manner contradicted his words she did not feel repulsed but made herself and child ready and when her former master had seated himself in the open dearborn she walked towards it intending to place herself and child in the rear and go with him But ere she reached the vehicle she says that God revealed himself to her with all the suddenness of a flash of lightning showing her 'in the twinkling of an eye that he was all over' that he pervaded the universe 'and that there was no place where God was not ' She became instantly conscious of her great sin in forgetting her almighty Friend and 'ever present help in time of trouble ' All her unfulfilled promises arose before her like a vexed sea whose waves run mountains high and her soul which seemed but one mass of lies shrunk back aghast from the 'awful look' of him whom she had formerly talked to as if he had been a being like herself and she would now fain have hid herself in the bowels of the earth to have escaped his dread presence But she plainly saw there was no place not even in hell where he was not and where could she flee Another such 'a look ' as she expressed it and she felt that she must be extinguished forever even as one with the breath of his mouth 'blows out a lamp ' so that no spark remains A dire dread of annihilation now seized her and she waited to see if by 'another look ' she was to be stricken from existence swallowed up even as the fire licketh up the oil with which it comes in contact When at last the second look came not and her attention was once more called to outward things she observed her master had left and exclaiming aloud 'Oh God I did not know you were so big ' walked into the house and made an effort to resume her work But the workings of the inward man were too absorbing to admit of much attention to her avocations She desired to talk to God but her vileness utterly forbade it and she was not able to prefer a petition 'What ' said she 'shall I lie again to God I have told him nothing but lies and shall I speak again and tell another lie to God ' She could not and now she began to wish for some one to speak to God for her Then a space seemed opening between her and God and she felt that if some one who was worthy in the sight of heaven would but plead for her in their own name and not let God know it came from her who was so unworthy God might grant it At length a friend appeared to stand between herself and an insulted Deity and she felt as sensibly refreshed as when on a hot day an umbrella had been interposed between her scorching head and a burning sun But who was this friend became the next inquiry Was it Deencia who had so often befriended her She looked at her with her new power of sight and lo she too seemed all 'bruises and putrifying sores ' like herself No it was some one very different from Deencia 'Who are you ' she exclaimed as the vision brightened into a form distinct beaming with the beauty of holiness and radiant with love She then said audibly addressing the mysterious visitant 'I know you and I don't know you ' Meaning 'You seem perfectly familiar I feel that you not only love me but that you always have loved me yet I know you not I cannot call you by name ' When she said 'I know you ' the subject of the vision remained distinct and quiet When she said 'I don't know you ' it moved restlessly about like agitated waters So while she repeated without intermission 'I know you I know you ' that the vision might remain 'Who are you ' was the cry of her heart and her whole soul was in one deep prayer that this heavenly personage might be revealed to her and remain with her At length after bending both soul and body with the intensity of this desire till breath and strength seemed failing and she could maintain her position no longer an answer came to her saying distinctly 'It is Jesus ' 'Yes ' she responded 'it is Jesus ' Previous to these exercises of mind she heard Jesus mentioned in reading or speaking but had received from what she heard no impression that he was any other than an eminent man like a Washington or a Lafayette Now he appeared to her delighted mental vision as so mild so good and so every way lovely and he loved her so much And how strange that he had always loved her and she had never known it And how great a blessing he conferred in that he should stand between her and God And God was no longer a terror and a dread to her She stopped not to argue the point even in her own mind whether he had reconciled her to God or God to herself though she thinks the former now being but too happy that God was no longer to her as a consuming fire and Jesus was 'altogether lovely ' Her heart was now full of joy and gladness as it had been of terror and at one time of despair In the light of her great happiness the world was clad in new beauty the very air sparkled as with diamonds and was redolent of heaven She contemplated the unapproachable barriers that existed between herself and the great of this world as the world calls greatness and made surprising comparisons between them and the union existing between herself and Jesus Jesus the transcendently lovely as well as great and powerful for so he appeared to her though he seemed but human and she watched for his bodily appearance feeling that she should know him if she saw him and when he came she should go and dwell with him as with a dear friend It was not given her to see that he loved any other and she thought if others came to know and love him as she did she should be thrust aside and forgotten being herself but a poor ignorant slave with little to recommend her to his notice And when she heard him spoken of she said mentally 'What others know Jesus I thought no one knew Jesus but me ' and she felt a sort of jealousy lest she should be robbed of her newly found treasure She conceived one day as she listened to reading that she heard an intimation that Jesus was married and hastily inquired if Jesus had a wife 'What ' said the reader 'God have a wife ' 'Is Jesus God ' inquired Isabella 'Yes to be sure he is ' was the answer returned From this time her conceptions of Jesus became more elevated and spiritual and she sometimes spoke of him as God in accordance with the teaching she had received But when she was simply told that the Christian world was much divided on the subject of Christ's nature some believing him to be co qual with the Father to be God in and of himself 'very God of very God ' some that he is the 'well beloved ' 'only begotten Son of God ' and others that he is or was rather but a mere man she said 'Of that I only know as I saw I did not see him to be God else how could he stand between me and God I saw him as a friend standing between me and God through whom love flowed as from a fountain ' Now so far from expressing her views of Christ's character and office in accordance with any system of theology extant she says she believes Jesus is the same spirit that was in our first parents Adam and Eve in the beginning when they came from the hand of their Creator When they sinned through disobedience this pure spirit forsook them and fled to heaven that there it remained until it returned again in the person of Jesus and that previous to a personal union with him man is but a brute possessing only the spirit of an animal She avers that in her darkest hours she had no fear of any worse hell than the one she then carried in her bosom though it had ever been pictured to her in its deepest colors and threatened her as a reward for all her misdemeanors Her vileness and God's holiness and all pervading presence which filled immensity and threatened her with instant annihilation composed the burden of her vision of terror Her faith in prayer is equal to her faith in the love of Jesus Her language is 'Let others say what they will of the efficacy of prayer I believe in it and I shall pray Thank God Yes I shall always pray ' she exclaims putting her hands together with the greatest enthusiasm For some time subsequent to the happy change we have spoken of Isabella's prayers partook largely of their former character and while in deep affliction she labored for the recovery of her son she prayed with constancy and fervor and the following may be taken as a specimen 'Oh God you know how much I am distressed for I have told you again and again Now God help me get my son If you were in trouble as I am and I could help you as you can me think I would n't do it Yes God you know I would do it ' 'Oh God you know I have no money but you can make the people do for me and you must make the people do for me I will never give you peace till you do God ' 'Oh God make the people hear me don't let them turn me off without hearing and helping me ' And she has not a particle of doubt that God heard her and especially disposed the hearts of thoughtless clerks eminent lawyers and grave judges and others between whom and herself there seemed to her almost an infinite remove to listen to her suit with patient and respectful attention backing it up with all needed aid The sense of her nothingness in the eyes of those with whom she contended for her rights sometimes fell on her like a heavy weight which nothing but her unwavering confidence in an arm which she believed to be stronger than all others combined could have raised from her sinking spirit 'Oh how little I did feel ' she repeated with a powerful emphasis 'Neither would you wonder if you could have seen me in my ignorance and destitution trotting about the streets meanly clad bare headed and bare footed Oh God only could have made such people hear me and he did it in answer to my prayers ' And this perfect trust based on the rock of Deity was a soul protecting fortress which raising her above the battlements of fear and shielding her from the machinations of the enemy impelled her onward in the struggle till the foe was vanquished and the victory gained We have now seen Isabella her youngest daughter and her only son in possession of at least their nominal freedom It has been said that the freedom of the most free of the colored people of this country is but nominal but stinted and limited as it is at best it is an immense remove from chattel slavery This fact is disputed I know but I have no confidence in the honesty of such questionings If they are made in sincerity I honor not the judgment that thus decides Her husband quite advanced in age and infirm of health was emancipated with the balance of the adult slaves of the State according to law the following summer July For a few years after this event he was able to earn a scanty living and when he failed to do that he was dependent on the 'world's cold charity ' and died in a poor house Isabella had herself and two children to provide for her wages were trifling for at that time the wages of females were at a small advance from nothing and she doubtless had to learn the first elements of economy for what slaves that were never allowed to make any stipulations or calculations for themselves ever possessed an adequate idea of the true value of time or in fact of any material thing in the universe To such 'prudent using' is meanness and 'saving' is a word to be sneered at Of course it was not in her power to make to herself a home around whose sacred hearth stone she could collect her family as they gradually emerged from their prison house of bondage a home where she could cultivate their affection administer to their wants and instil into the opening minds of her children those principles of virtue and that love of purity truth and benevolence which must ever form the foundation of a life of usefulness and happiness No all this was far beyond her power or means in more senses than one and it should be taken into the account whenever a comparison is instituted between the progress made by her children in virtue and goodness and the progress of those who have been nurtured in the genial warmth of a sunny home where good influences cluster and bad ones are carefully excluded where 'line upon line and precept upon precept ' are daily brought to their quotidian tasks and where in short every appliance is brought in requisition that self denying parents can bring to bear on one of the dearest objects of a parent's life the promotion of the welfare of their children But God forbid that this suggestion should be wrested from its original intent and made to shield any one from merited rebuke Isabella's children are now of an age to know good from evil and may easily inform themselves on any point where they may yet be in doubt and if they now suffer themselves to be drawn by temptation into the paths of the destroyer or forget what is due to the mother who has done and suffered so much for them and who now that she is descending into the vale of years and feels her health and strength declining will turn her expecting eyes to them for aid and comfort just as instinctly as the child turns its confiding eye to its fond parent when it seeks for succor or for sympathy for it is now their turn to do the work and bear the burdens of life as all must bear them in turn as the wheel of life rolls on if I say they forget this their duty and their happiness and pursue an opposite course of sin and folly they must lose the respect of the wise and good and find when too late that 'the way of the transgressor is hard ' NEW TRIALS The reader will pardon this passing homily while we return to our narrative We were saying that the day dreams of Isabella and her husband the plan they drew of what they would do and the comforts they thought to have when they should obtain their freedom and a little home of their own had all turned to 'thin air ' by the postponement of their freedom to so late a day These delusive hopes were never to be realized and a new set of trials was gradually to open before her These were the heart wasting trials of watching over her children scattered and imminently exposed to the temptations of the adversary with few if any fixed principles to sustain them 'Oh ' she says 'how little did I know myself of the best way to instruct and counsel them Yet I did the best I then knew when with them I took them to the religious meetings I talked to and prayed for and with them when they did wrong I scolded at and whipped them ' Isabella and her son had been free about a year when they went to reside in the city of New York a place which she would doubtless have avoided could she have seen what was there in store for her for this view into the future would have taught her what she only learned by bitter experience that the baneful influences going up from such a city were not the best helps to education commenced as the education of her children had been Her son Peter was at the time of which we are speaking just at that age when no lad should be subjected to the temptations of such a place unprotected as he was save by the feeble arm of a mother herself a servant there He was growing up to be a tall well formed active lad of quick perceptions mild and cheerful in his disposition with much that was open generous and willing about him but with little power to withstand temptation and a ready ingenuity to provide himself with ways and means to carry out his plans and conceal from his mother and her friends all such as he knew would not meet their approbation As will be readily believed he was soon drawn into a circle of associates who did not improve either his habits or his morals Two years passed before Isabella knew what character Peter was establishing for himself among his low and worthless comrades passing under the assumed name of Peter Williams and she began to feel a parent's pride in the promising appearance of her only son But alas this pride and pleasure were shortly dissipated as distressing facts relative to him came one by one to her astonished ear A friend of Isabella's a lady who was much pleased with the good humor ingenuity and open confessions of Peter when driven into a corner and who she said 'was so smart he ought to have an education if any one ought ' paid ten dollars as tuition fee for him to attend a navigation school But Peter little inclined to spend his leisure hours in study when he might be enjoying himself in the dance or otherwise with his boon companions went regularly and made some plausible excuses to the teacher who received them as genuine along with the ten dollars of Mrs and while his mother and her friend believed him improving at school he was to their latent sorrow improving in a very different place or places and on entirely opposite principles They also procured him an excellent place as a coachman But wanting money he sold his livery and other things belonging to his master who having conceived a kind regard for him considered his youth and prevented the law from falling with all its rigor upon his head Still he continued to abuse his privileges and to involve himself in repeated difficulties from which his mother as often extricated him At each time she talked much and reasoned and remonstrated with him and he would with such perfect frankness lay open his whole soul to her telling her he had never intended doing harm how he had been led along little by little till before he was aware he found himself in trouble how he had tried to be good and how when he would have been so 'evil was present with him ' indeed he knew not how it was His mother beginning to feel that the city was no place for him urged his going to sea and would have shipped him on board a man of war but Peter was not disposed to consent to that proposition while the city and its pleasures were accessible to him Isabella now became a prey to distressing fears dreading lest the next day or hour come fraught with the report of some dreadful crime committed or abetted by her son She thanks the Lord for sparing her that giant sorrow as all his wrong doings never ranked higher in the eye of the law than misdemeanors But as she could see no improvement in Peter as a last resort she resolved to leave him for a time unassisted to bear the penalty of his conduct and see what effect that would have on him In the trial hour she remained firm in her resolution Peter again fell into the hands of the police and sent for his mother as usual but she went not to his relief In his extremity he sent for Peter Williams a respectable colored barber whose name he had been wearing and who sometimes helped young culprits out of their troubles and sent them from city dangers by shipping them on board of whaling vessels The curiosity of this man was awakened by the culprit's bearing his own name He went to the Tombs and inquired into his case but could not believe what Peter told him respecting his mother and family Yet he redeemed him and Peter promised to leave New York in a vessel that was to sail in the course of a week He went to see his mother and informed her of what had happened to him She listened incredulously as to an idle tale He asked her to go with him and see for herself She went giving no credence to his story till she found herself in the presence of Mr Williams and heard him saying to her 'I am very glad I have assisted your son he stood in great need of sympathy and assistance but I could not think he had such a mother here although he assured me he had ' Isabella's great trouble now was a fear lest her son should deceive his benefactor and be missing when the vessel sailed but he begged her earnestly to trust him for he said he had resolved to do better and meant to abide by the resolve Isabella's heart gave her no peace till the time of sailing when Peter sent Mr Williams and another messenger whom she knew to tell her he had sailed But for a month afterwards she looked to see him emerging from some by place in the city and appearing before her so afraid was she that he was still unfaithful and doing wrong But he did not appear and at length she believed him really gone He left in the summer of and his friends heard nothing further from him till his mother received the following letter dated 'October ' 'MY DEAR AND BELOVED MOTHER 'I take this opportunity to write to you and inform you that I am well and in hopes for to find you the same I am got on board the same unlucky ship Done of Nantucket I am sorry for to say that I have been punished once severely by shoving my head in the fire for other folks We have had bad luck but in hopes to have better We have about on board but in

let me go Let me go to the spot where the cateract plays Where oft I have sported in my boyish days And there is my poor mother whose heart ever flows At the sight of her poor child to her let me go let me go 'Your only son 'PETER VAN WAGENER ' Since the date of the last letter Isabella has heard no tidings from her long absent son though ardently does her mother's heart long for such tidings as her thoughts follow him around the world in his perilous vocation saying within herself 'He is good now I have no doubt I feel sure that he has persevered and kept the resolve he made before he left home he seemed so different before he went so determined to do better ' His letters are inserted here for preservation in case they prove the last she ever hears from him in this world FINDING A BROTHER AND SISTER When Isabella had obtained the freedom of her son she remained in Kingston where she had been drawn by the judicial process about a year during which time she became a member of the Methodist Church there and when she went to New York she took a letter missive from that church to the Methodist Church in John street Afterwards she withdrew her connection with that church and joined Zion's Church in Church street composed entirely of colored people With the latter church she remained until she went to reside with Mr Pierson after which she was gradually drawn into the 'kingdom' set up by the prophet Matthias in the name of God the Father for he said the spirit of God the Father dwelt in him While Isabella was in New York her sister Sophia came from Newberg to reside in the former place Isabel had been favored with occasional interviews with this sister although at one time she lost sight of her for the space of seventeen years almost the entire period of her being at Mr Dumont's and when she appeared before her again handsomely dressed she did not recognize her till informed who she was Sophia informed her that her brother Michael a brother she had never seen was in the city and when she introduced him to Isabella he informed her that their sister Nancy had been living in the city and had deceased a few months before He described her features her dress her manner and said she had for some time been a member in Zion's Church naming the class she belonged to Isabella almost instantly recognized her as a sister in the church with whom she had knelt at the altar and with whom she had exchanged the speaking pressure of the hand in recognition of their spiritual sisterhood little thinking at the time that they were also children of the same earthly parents even Bomefree and Mau mau Bett As inquiries and answers rapidly passed and the conviction deepened that this was their sister the very sister they had heard so much of but had never seen for she was the self same sister that had been locked in the great old fashioned sleigh box when she was taken away never to behold her mother's face again this side the spirit land and Michael the narrator was the brother who had shared her fate Isabella thought 'D h here she was we met and was I not at the time struck with the peculiar feeling of her hand the bony hardness so just like mine and yet I could not know she was my sister and now I see she looked so like my mother ' And Isabella wept and not alone Sophia wept and the strong man Michael mingled his tears with theirs 'Oh Lord ' inquired Isabella 'what is this slavery that it can do such dreadful things what evil can it not do ' Well may she ask for surely the evils it can and does do daily and hourly can never be summed up till we can see them as they are recorded by him who writes no errors and reckons without mistake This account which now varies so widely in the estimate of different minds will be viewed alike by all Think you dear reader when that day comes the most 'rabid abolitionist' will say 'Behold I saw all this while on the earth ' Will he not rather say 'Oh who has conceived the breadth and depth of this moral malaria this putrescent plague spot ' Perhaps the pioneers in the slave's cause will be as much surprised as any to find that with all their looking there remained so much unseen GLEANINGS There are some hard things that crossed Isabella's life while in slavery that she has no desire to publish for various reasons First because the parties from whose hands she suffered them have rendered up their account to a higher tribunal and their innocent friends alone are living to have their feelings injured by the recital secondly because they are not all for the public ear from their very nature thirdly and not least because she says were she to tell all that happened to her as a slave all that she knows is 'God's truth' it would seem to others especially the uninitiated so unaccountable so unreasonable and what is usually called so unnatural though it may be questioned whether people do not always act naturally they would not easily believe it 'Why no ' she says 'they'd call me a liar they would indeed and I do not wish to say anything to destroy my own character for veracity though what I say is strictly true ' Some things have been omitted through forgetfulness which not having been mentioned in their places can only be briefly spoken of here such as that her father Bomefree had had two wives before he took Mau mau Bett one of whom if not both were torn from him by the iron hand of the ruthless trafficker in human flesh that her husband Thomas after one of his wives had been sold away from him ran away to New York City where he remained a year or two before he was discovered and taken back to the prison house of slavery that her master Dumont when he promised Isabella one year of her time before the State should make her free made the same promise to her husband and in addition to freedom they were promised a log cabin for a home of their own all of which with the one thousand and one day dreams resulting therefrom went into the repository of unfulfilled promises and unrealized hopes that she had often heard her father repeat a thrilling story of a little slave child which because it annoyed the family with its cries was caught up by a white man who dashed its brains out against the wall An Indian for Indians were plenty in that region then passed along as the bereaved mother washed the bloody corpse of her murdered child and learning the cause of its death said with characteristic vehemence 'If I had been here I would have put my tomahawk in his head ' meaning the murderer's Of the cruelty of one Hasbrouck He had a sick slavewoman who was lingering with a slow consumption whom he made to spin regardless of her weakness and suffering and this woman had a child that was unable to walk or talk at the age of five years neither could it cry like other children but made a constant piteous moaning sound This exhibition of helplessness and imbecility instead of exciting the master's pity stung his cupidity and so enraged him that he would kick the poor thing about like a foot ball Isabella's informant had seen this brute of a man when the child was curled up under a chair innocently amusing itself with a few sticks drag it thence that he might have the pleasure of tormenting it She had seen him with one blow of his foot send it rolling quite across the room and down the steps at the door Oh how she wished it might instantly die 'But ' she said 'it seemed as tough as a moccasin ' Though it did die at last and made glad the heart of its friends and its persecutor no doubt rejoiced with them but from very different motives But the day of his retribution was not far off for he sickened and his reason fled It was fearful to hear his old slave soon tell how in the day of his calamity she treated him She was very strong and was therefore selected to support her master as he set up in bed by putting her arms around while she stood behind him It was then that she did her best to wreak her vengeance on him She would clutch his feeble frame in her iron grasp as in a vice and when her mistress did not see would give him a squeeze a shake and lifting him up set him down again as hard as possible If his breathing betrayed too tight a grasp and her mistress said 'Be careful don't hurt him Soan ' her ever ready answer was 'Oh no Missus no ' in her most pleasant tone and then as soon as Missus's eyes and ears were engaged away another grasp another shake another bounce She was afraid the disease alone would let him recover an event she dreaded more than to do wrong herself Isabella asked her if she were not afraid his spirit would haunt her 'Oh no ' says Soan 'he was so wicked the devil will never let him out of hell long enough for that ' Many slaveholders boast of the love of their slaves How would it freeze the blood of some of them to know what kind of love rankles in the bosoms of slaves for them Witness the attempt to poison Mrs Calhoun and hundreds of similar cases Most 'surprising' to every body because committed by slaves supposed to be so grateful for their chains These reflections bring to mind a discussion on this point between the writer and a slaveholding friend in Kentucky on Christmas morning We had asserted that until mankind were far in advance of what they now are irresponsible power over our fellow beings would be as it is abused Our friend declared it his conviction that the cruelties of slavery existed chiefly in imagination and that no person in D County where we then were but would be above ill treating a helpless slave We answered that if his belief was well founded the people in Kentucky were greatly in advance of the people of New England for we would not dare say as much as that of any school district there letting alone counties No we would not answer for our own conduct even on so delicate a point The next evening he very magnanimously overthrew his own position and established ours by informing us that on the morning previous and as near as we could learn at the very hour in which we were earnestly discussing the probabilities of the case a young woman of fine appearance and high standing in society the pride of her husband and the mother of an infant daughter only a few miles from us ay in D County too was actually beating in the skull of a slave woman called Tabby and not content with that had her tied up and whipped after her skull was broken and she died hanging to the bedstead to which she had been fastened When informed that Tabby was dead she answered 'I am glad of it for she has worried my life out of me ' But Tabby's highest good was probably not the end proposed by Mrs M for no one supposed she meant to kill her Tabby was considered quite lacking in good sense and no doubt belonged to that class at the South that are silly enough to 'die of moderate correction ' A mob collected around the house for an hour or two in that manner expressing a momentary indignation But was she treated as a murderess Not at all She was allowed to take boat for her residence was near the beautiful Ohio that evening to spend a few months with her absent friends after which she returned and remained with her husband no one to 'molest or make her afraid ' Had she been left to the punishment of an outraged conscience from right motives I would have 'rejoiced with exceeding joy ' But to see the life of one woman and she a murderess put in the balance against the lives of three millions of innocent slaves and to contrast her punishment with what I felt would be the punishment of one who was merely suspected of being an equal friend of all mankind regardless of color or condition caused my blood to stir within me and my heart to sicken at the thought The husband of Mrs M was absent from home at the time alluded to and when he arrived some weeks afterwards bringing beautiful presents to his cherished companion he beheld his once happy home deserted Tabby murdered and buried in the garden and the wife of his bosom and the mother of his child the doer of the dreadful deed a murderess When Isabella went to New York city she went in company with a Miss Gear who introduced her to the family of Mr James Latourette a wealthy merchant and a Methodist in religion but who the latter part of his life felt that he had outgrown ordinances and advocated free meetings holding them at his own dwelling house for several years previous to his death She worked for them and they generously gave her a home while she labored for others and in their kindness made her as one of their own At that time the 'moral reform' movement was awakening the attention of the benevolent in that city Many women among whom were Mrs Latourette and Miss Gear became deeply interested in making an attempt to reform their fallen sisters even the most degraded of them and in this enterprise of labor and danger they enlisted Isabella and others who for a time put forth their most zealous efforts and performed the work of missionaries with much apparent success Isabella accompanied those ladies to the most wretched abodes of vice and misery and sometimes she went where they dared not follow They even succeeded in establishing prayer meetings in several places where such a thing might least have been expected But these meetings soon became the most noisy shouting ranting and boisterous of gatherings where they became delirious with excitement and then exhausted from over action Such meetings Isabel had not much sympathy with at best But one evening she attended one of them where the members of it in a fit of ecstasy jumped upon her cloak in such a manner as to drag her to the floor and then thinking she had fallen in a spiritual trance they increased their glorifications on her account jumping shouting stamping and clapping of hands rejoicing so much over her spirit and so entirely overlooking her body that she suffered much both from fear and bruises and ever after refused to attend any more such meetings doubting much whether God had any thing to do with such worship THE MATTHIAS IMPOSTURE We now come to an eventful period in the life of Isabella as identified with one of the most extraordinary religious impostures of modern times but the limits prescribed for the present work forbid a minute narration of all the occurrences that transpired in relation to it After she had joined the African Church in Church street and during her membership there she frequently attended Mr Latourette's meetings at one of which Mr Smith invited her to go to a prayer meeting or to instruct the girls at the Magdalene Asylum Bowery Hill then under the protection of Mr Pierson and some other persons chiefly respectable females To reach the Asylum Isabella called on Katy Mr Pierson's colored servant of whom she had some knowledge Mr Pierson saw her there conversed with her asked her if she had been baptized and was answered characteristically 'by the Holy Ghost ' After this Isabella saw Katy several times and occasionally Mr Pierson who engaged her to keep his house while Katy went to Virginia to see her children This engagement was considered an answer to prayer by Mr Pierson who had both fasted and prayed on the subject while Katy and Isabella appeared to see in it the hand of God Mr Pierson was characterized by a strong devotional spirit which finally became highly fanatical He assumed the title of Prophet asserting that God had called him in an omnibus in these words 'Thou art Elijah the Tishbite Gather unto me all the members of Israel at the foot of Mount Carmel' which he understood as meaning the gathering of his friends at Bowery Hill Not long afterward he became acquainted with the notorious Matthias whose career was as extraordinary as it was brief Robert Matthews or Matthias as he was usually called was of Scotch extraction but a native of Washington county New York and at that time about forty seven years of age He was religiously brought up among the Anti Burghers a sect of Presbyterians the clergyman the Rev Mr Bevridge visiting the family after the manner of the church and being pleased with Robert put his hand on his head when a boy and pronounced a blessing and this blessing with his natural qualities determined his character for he ever after thought he should be a distinguished man Matthias was brought up a farmer till nearly eighteen years of age but acquired indirectly the art of a carpenter without any regular apprenticeship and showed considerable mechanical skill He obtained property from his uncle Robert Thompson and then he went into business as a store keeper was considered respectable and became a member of the Scotch Presbyterian Church He married in and continued in business in Cambridge In he ruined himself by a building speculation and the derangement of the currency which denied bank facilities and soon after he came to New York with his family and worked at his trade He afterwards removed to Albany and became a hearer at the Dutch Reformed Church then under Dr Ludlow's charge He was frequently much excited on religious subjects In he was well known if not for street preaching for loud discussions and pavement exhortations but he did not make set sermons In the beginning of he was only considered zealous but in the same year he prophesied the destruction of the Albanians and their capital and while preparing to shave with the Bible before him he suddenly put down the soap and exclaimed 'I have found it I have found a text which proves that no man who shaves his beard can be a true Christian ' and shortly afterwards without shaving he went to the Mission House to deliver an address which he had promised and in this address he proclaimed his new character pronounced vengeance on the land and that the law of God was the only rule of government and that he was commanded to take possession of the world in the name of the King of kings His harangue was cut short by the trustees putting out the lights About this time Matthias laid by his implements of industry and in June he advised his wife to fly with him from the destruction which awaited them in the city and on her refusal partly on account of Matthias calling himself a Jew whom she was unwilling to retain as a husband he left her taking some of the children to his sister in Argyle forty miles from Albany At Argyle he entered the church and interrupted the minister declaring the congregation in darkness and warning them to repentance He was of course taken out of the church and as he was advertised in the Albany papers he was sent back to his family His beard had now obtained a respectable length and thus he attracted attention and easily obtained an audience in the streets For this he was sometimes arrested once by mistake for Adam Paine who collected the crowd and then left Matthias with it on the approach of the officers He repeatedly urged his wife to accompany him on a mission to convert the world declaring that food could be obtained from the roots of the forest if not administered otherwise At this time he assumed the name of Matthias called himself a Jew and set out on a mission taking a western course and visiting a brother at Rochester a skilful mechanic since dead Leaving his brother he proceeded on his mission over the Northern States occasionally returning to Albany After visiting Washington and passing through Pennsylvania he came to New York His appearance at that time was mean but grotesque and his sentiments were but little known On May the th he first called on Mr Pierson in Fourth street in his absence Isabella was alone in the house in which she had lived since the previous autumn On opening the door she for the first time beheld Matthias and her early impression of seeing Jesus in the flesh rushed into her mind She heard his inquiry and invited him into the parlor and being naturally curious and much excited and possessing a good deal of tact she drew him into conversation stated her own opinions and heard his replies and explanations Her faith was at first staggered by his declaring himself a Jew but on this point she was relieved by his saying 'Do you not remember how Jesus prayed ' and repeated part of the Lord's prayer in proof that the Father's kingdom was to come and not the Son's She then understood him to be a converted Jew and in the conclusion she says she 'felt as if God had sent him to set up the kingdom ' Thus Matthias at once secured the good will of Isabella and we may suppose obtained from her some information in relation to Mr Pierson especially that Mrs Pierson declared there was no true church and approved of Mr Pierson's preaching Matthias left the house promising to return on Saturday evening Mr P at this time had not seen Matthias Isabella desirous of hearing the expected conversation between Matthias and Mr Pierson on Saturday hurried her work got it finished and was permitted to be present Indeed the sameness of belief made her familiar with her employer while her attention to her work and characteristic faithfulness increased his confidence This intimacy the result of holding the same faith and the principle afterwards adopted of having but one table and all things in common made her at once the domestic and the equal and the depository of very curious if not valuable information To this object even her color assisted Persons who have travelled in the South know the manner in which the colored people and especially slaves are treated they are scarcely regarded as being present This trait in our American character has been frequently noticed by foreign travellers One English lady remarks that she discovered in course of conversation with a Southern married gentleman that a colored girl slept in his bedroom in which also was his wife and when he saw that it occasioned some surprise he remarked 'What would he do if he wanted a glass of water in the night ' Other travellers have remarked that the presence of colored people never seemed to interrupt conversation of any kind for one moment Isabella then was present at the first interview between Matthias and Pierson At this interview Mr Pierson asked Matthias if he had a family to which he replied in the affirmative he asked him about his beard and he gave a scriptural reason asserting also that the Jews did not shave and that Adam had a beard Mr Pierson detailed to Matthias his experience and Matthias gave his and they mutually discovered that they held the same sentiments both admitting the direct influence of the Spirit and the transmission of spirits from one body to another Matthias admitted the call of Mr Pierson in the omnibus in Wall street which on this occasion he gave in these words 'Thou art Elijah the Tishbite and thou shalt go before me in the spirit and power of Elias to prepare my way before me ' And Mr Pierson admitted Matthias' call who completed his declaration on the th of June in Argyle which by a curious coincidence was the very day on which Pierson had received his call in the omnibus Such singular coincidences have a powerful effect on excited minds From that discovery Pierson and Matthias rejoiced in each other and became kindred spirits Matthias however claiming to be the Father or to possess the spirit of the Father he was God upon earth because the spirit of God dwelt in him while Pierson then understood that his mission was like that of John the Baptist which the name Elias meant This conference ended with an invitation to supper and Matthias and Pierson washing each other's feet Mr Pierson preached on the following Sunday but after which he declined in favor of Matthias and some of the party believed that the 'kingdom had then come ' As a specimen of Matthias' preaching and sentiments the following is said to be reliable 'The spirit that built the Tower of Babel is now in the world it is the spirit of the devil The spirit of man never goes upon the clouds all who think so are Babylonians The only heaven is on the earth All who are ignorant of truth are Ninevites The Jews did not crucify Christ it was the Gentiles Every Jew has his guardian angel attending him in this world God don't speak through preachers he speaks through me his prophet ' John the Baptist addressing Mr Pierson read the tenth of Revelations ' After the reading of the the prophet resumed speaking as follows 'Ours is the mustard seed kingdom which is to spread all over the earth Our creed is truth and no man can find truth unless he obeys John the Baptist and comes clean into the church 'All real men will be saved all mock men will be damned When a person has the Holy Ghost then he is a man and not till then They who teach women are of the wicked The communion is all nonsense so is prayer Eating a nip of bread and drinking a little wine won't do any good All who admit members into their church and suffer them to hold their lands and houses their sentence is Depart ye wicked I know you not All females who lecture their husbands their sentence is the same The sons of truth are to enjoy all the good things of this world and must use their means to bring it about Every thing that has the smell of woman will be destroyed Woman is the capsheaf of the abomination of desolation full of all deviltry In a short time the world will take fire and dissolve it is combustible already All women not obedient had better become so as soon as possible and let the wicked spirit depart and become temples of truth Praying is all mocking When you see any one wring the neck of a fowl instead of cutting off its head he has not got the Holy Ghost Cutting gives the least pain 'All who eat swine's flesh are of the devil and just as certain as he eats it he will tell a lie in less than half an hour If you eat a piece of pork it will go crooked through you and the Holy Ghost will not stay in you but one or the other must leave the house pretty soon The pork will be as crooked in you as rams' horns and as great a nuisance as the hogs in the street 'The cholera is not the right word it is choler which means God's wrath Abraham Isaac and Jacob are now in this world they did not go up in the clouds as some believe why should they go there They don't want to go there to box the compass from one place to another The Christians now a days are for setting up the Son's kingdom It is not his it is the Father's kingdom It puts me in mind of the man in the country who took his son in business and had his sign made Hitchcock Son but the son wanted it Hitchcock Father and that is the way with your Christians They talk of the Son's kingdom first and not the Father's kingdom ' Matthias and his disciples at this time did not believe in a resurrection of the body but that the spirits of the former saints would enter the bodies of the present generation and thus begin heaven upon earth of which he and Mr Pierson were the first fruits Matthias made the residence of Mr Pierson his own but the latter being apprehensive of popular violence in his house if Matthias remained there proposed a monthly allowance to him and advised him to occupy another dwelling Matthias accordingly took a house in Clarkson street and then sent for his family at Albany but they declined coming to the city However his brother George complied with a similar offer bringing his family with him where they found very comfortable quarters Isabella was employed to do the housework In May Matthias left his house and placed the furniture part of which was Isabella's elsewhere living himself at the hotel corner of Marketfield and West streets Isabella found employment at Mr Whiting's Canal street and did the washing for Matthias by Mrs Whiting's permission Of the subsequent removal of Matthias to the farm and residence of Mr B Folger at Sing Sing where he was joined by Mr Pierson and others laboring under a similar religious delusion the sudden melancholy and somewhat suspicious death of Mr Pierson and the arrest of Matthias on the charge of his murder ending in a verdict of not guilty the criminal connection that subsisted between Matthias Mrs Folger and other members of the 'Kingdom ' as 'match spirits' the final dispersion of this deluded company and the voluntary exilement of Matthias in the far West after his release c c we do not deem it useful or necessary to give any particulars Those who are curious to know what there transpired are referred to a work published in New York in entitled 'Fanaticism its Sources and Influence illustrated by the simple Narrative of Isabella in the case of Matthias Mr and Mrs B Folger Mr Pierson Mr Mills Catharine Isabella c c By G Vale Roosevelt street ' Suffice it to say that while Isabella was a member of the household at Sing Sing doing much laborious service in the spirit of religious disinterestedness and gradually getting her vision purged and her mind cured of its illusions she happily escaped the contamination that surrounded her assiduously endeavoring to discharge all her duties in a becoming manner FASTING When Isabella resided with Mr Pierson he was in the habit of fasting every Friday not eating or drinking anything from Thursday evening to six o'clock on Friday evening Then again he would fast two nights and three days neither eating nor drinking refusing himself even a cup of cold water till the third day at night when he took supper again as usual Isabella asked him why he fasted He answered that fasting gave him great light in the things of God which answer gave birth to the following train of thought in the mind of his auditor 'Well if fasting will give light inwardly and spiritually I need it as much as any body and I'll fast too If Mr Pierson needs to fast two nights and three days then I who need light more than he does ought to fast more and I will fast three nights and three days ' This resolution she carried out to the letter putting not so much as a drop of water in her mouth for three whole days and nights The fourth morning as she arose to her feet not having power to stand she fell to the floor but recovering herself sufficiently she made her way to the pantry and feeling herself quite voracious and fearing that she might now offend God by her voracity compelled herself to breakfast on dry bread and water eating a large six penny loaf before she felt at all stayed or satisfied She says she did get light but it was all in her body and none in her mind and this lightness of body lasted a long time Oh she was so light and felt so well she could 'skim around like a gull ' THE CAUSE OF HER LEAVING THE CITY The first years spent by Isabella in the city she accumulated more than enough to supply all her wants and she placed all the overplus in the Savings' Bank Afterwards while living with Mr Pierson he prevailed on her to take it thence and invest it in a common fund which he was about establishing as a fund to be drawn from by all the faithful the faithful of course were the handful that should subscribe to his peculiar creed This fund commenced by Mr Pierson afterwards became part and parcel of the kingdom of which Matthias assumed to be head and at the breaking up of the kingdom her little property was merged in the general ruin or went to enrich those who profited by the loss of others if any such there were Mr Pierson and others had so assured her that the fund would supply all her wants at all times and in all emergencies and to the end of life that she became perfectly careless on the subject asking for no interest when she drew her money from the bank and taking no account of the sum she placed in the fund She recovered a few articles of furniture from the wreck of the kingdom and received a small sum of money from Mr B Folger as the price of Mrs Folger's attempt to convict her of murder With this to start upon she commenced anew her labors in the hope of yet being able to accumulate a sufficiency to make a little home for herself in her advancing age With this stimulus before her she toiled hard working early and late doing a great deal for a little money and turning her hand to almost any thing that promised good pay Still she did not prosper and somehow could not contrive to lay by a single dollar for a 'rainy day ' When this had been the state of her affairs some time she suddenly paused and taking a retrospective view of what had passed inquired within herself why it was that for all her unwearied labors she had nothing to show why it was that others with much less care and labor could hoard up treasures for themselves and children She became more and more convinced as she reasoned that every thing she had undertaken in the city of New York had finally proved a failure and where her hopes had been raised the highest there she felt the failure had been the greatest and the disappointment most severe After turning it in her mind for some time she came to the conclusion that she had been taking part in a great drama which was in itself but one great system of robbery and wrong 'Yes ' she said 'the rich rob the poor and the poor rob one another ' True she had not received labor from others and stinted their pay as she felt had been practised against her but she had taken their work from them which was their only means to get money and was the same to them in the end For instance a gentleman where she lived would give her a half dollar to hire a poor man to clear the new fallen snow from the steps and side walks She would arise early and perform the labor herself putting the money into her own pocket A poor man would come along saying she ought to have let him have the job he was poor and needed the pay for his family She would harden her heart against him and answer 'I am poor too and I need it for mine ' But in her retrospection she thought of all the misery she might have been adding to in her selfish grasping and it troubled her conscience sorely and this insensibility to the claims of human brotherhood and the wants of the destitute and wretched poor she now saw as she never had done before to be unfeeling selfish and wicked These reflections and convictions gave rise to a sudden revulsion of feeling in the heart of Isabella and she began to look upon money and property with great indifference if not contempt being at that time unable probably to discern any difference between a miserly grasping at and hoarding of money and means and a true use of the good things of this life for one's own comfort and the relief of such as she might be enabled to befriend and assist One thing she was sure of that the precepts 'Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you ' 'Love your neighbor as yourself ' and so forth were maxims that had been but little thought of by herself or practised by those about her Her next decision was that she must leave the city it was no place for her yea she felt called in spirit to leave it and to travel east and lecture She had never been further east than the city neither had she any friends there of whom she had particular reason to expect any thing yet to her it was plain that her mission lay in the east and that she would find friends there She determined on leaving but these determinations and convictions she kept close locked in her own breast knowing that if her children and friends were aware of it they would make such an ado about it as would render it very unpleasant if not distressing to all parties Having made what preparations for leaving she deemed necessary which was to put up a few articles of clothing in a pillow case all else being deemed an unnecessary incumbrance about an hour before she left she informed Mrs Whiting the woman of the house where she was stopping that her name was no longer Isabella but SOJOURNER and that she was going east And to her inquiry 'What are you going east for ' her answer was 'The Spirit calls me there and I must go ' She left the city on the morning of the st of June crossing over to Brooklyn L I and taking the rising sun for her only compass and guide she 'remembered Lot's wife ' and hoping to avoid her fate she resolved not to look back till she felt sure the wicked city from which she was fleeing was left too far behind to be visible in the distance and when she first ventured to look back she could just discern the blue cloud of smoke that hung over it and she thanked the Lord that she was thus far removed from what seemed to her a second Sodom She was now fairly started on her pilgrimage her bundle in one hand and a little basket of provisions in the other and two York shillings in her purse her heart strong in the faith that her true work lay before her and that the Lord was her director and she doubted not he would provide for and protect her and that it would be very censurable in her to burden herself with any thing more than a moderate supply for her then present needs Her mission was not merely to travel east but to 'lecture ' as she designated it 'testifying of the hope that was in her' exhorting the people to embrace Jesus and refrain from sin the nature and origin of which she explained to them in accordance with her own most curious and original views Through her life and all its chequered changes she has ever clung fast to her first permanent impressions on religious subjects Wherever night overtook her there she sought for lodgings free if she might if not she paid at a tavern if she chanced to be at one if not at a private dwelling with the rich if they would receive her if not with the poor But she soon discovered that the largest houses were nearly always full if not quite full company was soon expected and that it was much easier to find an unoccupied corner in a small house than in a large one and if a person possessed but a miserable roof over his head you might be sure of a welcome to part of it But this she had penetration enough to see was quite as much the effect of a want of sympathy as of benevolence and this was also very apparent in her religious conversations with people who were strangers to her She said 'she never could find out that the rich had any religion If I had been rich and accomplished I could for the rich could always find religion in the rich and I could find it among the poor ' At first she attended such meetings as she heard of in the vicinity of her travels and spoke to the people as she found them assembled Afterwards she advertised meetings of her own and held forth to large audiences having as she said 'a good time ' When she became weary of travelling and wished a place to stop a while and rest herself she said some opening for her was always near at hand and the first time she needed rest a man accosted her as she was walking inquiring if she was looking for work She told him that was not the object of her travels but that she would willingly work a few days if any one wanted He requested her to go to his family who were sadly in want of assistance which he had been thus far unable to supply She went to the house where she was directed and was received by his family one of whom was ill as a 'God send ' and when she felt constrained to resume her journey they were very sorry and would fain have detained her longer but as she urged the necessity of leaving they offered her what seemed in her eyes a great deal of money as a remuneration for her labor and an expression of their gratitude for her opportune assistance but she would only receive a very little of it enough as she says to enable her to pay tribute to C sar if it was demanded of her and two or three York shillings at a time were all she allowed herself to take and then with purse replenished and strength renewed she would once more set out to perform her mission THE CONSEQUENCES OF REFUSING A TRAVELLER A NIGHT'S LODGING As she drew near the centre of the Island she commenced one evening at nightfall to solicit the favor of a night's lodging She had repeated her request a great many it seemed to her some twenty times and as many times she received a negative answer She walked on the stars and the tiny horns of the new moon shed but a dim light on her lonely way when she was familiarly accosted by two Indians who took her for an acquaintance She told them they were mistaken in the person she was a stranger there and asked them the direction to a tavern They informed her it was yet a long way some two miles or so and inquired if she were alone Not wishing for their protection or knowing what might be the character of their kindness she answered 'No not exactly ' and passed on At the end of a weary way she came to the tavern or rather to a large building which was occupied as court house tavern and jail and on asking for a night's lodging was informed she could stay if she would consent to be locked in This to her mind was an insuperable objection To have a key turned on her was a thing not to be thought of at least not to be endured and she again took up her line of march preferring to walk beneath the open sky to being locked up by a stranger in such a place She had not walked far before she heard the voice of a woman under an open shed she ventured to accost her and inquired if she knew where she could get in for the night The woman answered that she did not unless she went home with them and turning to her 'good man ' asked him if the stranger could not share their home for the night to which he cheerfully assented Sojourner thought it evident he had been taking a drop too much but as he was civil and good natured and she did not feel inclined to spend the night alone in the open air she felt driven to the necessity of accepting their hospitality whatever it might prove to be The woman soon informed her that there was a ball in the place at which they would like to drop in a while before they went to their home Balls being no part of Sojourner's mission she was not desirous of attending but her hostess could be satisfied with nothing short of a taste of it and she was forced to go with her or relinquish their company at once in which move there might be more exposure than in accompanying her She went and soon found herself surrounded by an assemblage of people collected from the very dregs of society too ignorant and degraded to understand much less entertain a high or bright idea in a dirty hovel destitute of every comfort and where the fumes of whisky were abundant and powerful Sojourner's guide there was too much charmed with the combined entertainments of the place to be able to tear herself away till she found her faculties for enjoyment failing her from a too free use of liquor and she betook herself to bed till she could recover them Sojourner seated in a corner had time for many reflections and refrained from lecturing them in obedience to the recommendation 'Cast not your pearls ' c When the night was far spent the husband of the sleeping woman aroused the sleeper and reminded her that she was not very polite to the woman she had invited to sleep at her house and of the propriety of returning home They once more emerged into the pure air which to our friend Sojourner after so long breathing the noisome air of the ball room was most refreshing and grateful Just as day dawned they reached the place they called their home Sojourner now saw that she had lost nothing in the shape of rest by remaining so long at the ball as their miserable cabin afforded but one bunk or pallet for sleeping and had there been many such she would have preferred sitting up all night to occupying one like it They very politely offered her the bed if she would use it but civilly declining she waited for morning with an eagerness of desire she never felt before on the subject and was never more happy than when the eye of day shed its golden light once more over the earth She was once more free and while day light should last independent and needed no invitation to pursue her journey Let these facts teach us that every pedestrian in the world is not a vagabond and that it is a dangerous thing to compel any one to receive that hospitality from the vicious and abandoned which they should have received from us as thousands can testify who have thus been caught in the snares of the wicked The fourth of July Isabella arrived at Huntingdon from thence she went to Cold Springs where she found the people making preparations for a mass temperance meeting With her usual alacrity she entered into their labors getting up dishes a la New York greatly to the satisfaction of those she assisted After remaining at Cold Springs some three weeks she returned to Huntingdon where she took boat for Connecticut Landing at Bridgeport she again resumed her travels towards the north east lecturing some and working some to get wherewith to pay tribute to C sar as she called it and in this manner she presently came to the city of New Haven where she found many meetings which she attended at some of which she was allowed to express her views freely and without reservation She also called meetings expressly to give herself an opportunity to be heard and found in the city many true friends of Jesus as she judged with whom she held communion of spirit having no preference for one sect more than another but being well satisfied with all who gave her evidence of having known or loved the Savior After thus delivering her testimony in this pleasant city feeling she had not as yet found an abiding place she went from thence to Bristol at the request of a zealous sister who desired her to go to the latter place and hold a religious conversation with some friends of hers there She went as requested found the people kindly and religiously disposed and through them she became acquainted with several very interesting persons A spiritually minded brother in Bristol becoming interested in her new views and original opinions requested as a favor that she would go to Hartford to see and converse with friends of his there Standing ready to perform any service in the Lord she went to Hartford as desired bearing in her hand the following note from this brother 'SISTER I send you this living messenger as I believe her to be one that God loves Ethiopia is stretching forth her hands unto God You can see by this sister that God does by his Spirit alone teach his own children things to come Please receive her and she will tell you some new things Let her tell her story without interrupting her and give close attention and you will see she has got the lever of truth that God helps her to pry where but few can She cannot read or write but the law is in her heart 'Send her to brother brother and where she can do the most good 'From your brother H L B ' SOME OF HER VIEWS AND REASONINGS As soon as Isabella saw God as an all powerful all pervading spirit she became desirous of hearing all that had been written of him and listened to the account of the creation of the world and its first inhabitants as contained in the first s of Genesis with peculiar interest For some time she received it all literally though it appeared strange to her that 'God worked by the day got tired and stopped to rest ' c But after a little time she began to reason upon it thus 'Why if God works by the day and one day's work tires him and he is obliged to rest either from weariness or on account of darkness or if he waited for the cool of the day to walk in the garden because he was inconvenienced by the heat of the sun why then it seems that God cannot do as much as I can for I can bear the sun at noon and work several days and nights in succession without being much tired Or if he rested nights because of the darkness it is very queer that he should make the night so dark that he could not see himself If I had been God I would have made the night light enough for my own convenience surely ' But the moment she placed this idea of God by the side of the impression she had once so suddenly received of his inconceivable greatness and entire spirituality that moment she exclaimed mentally 'No God does not stop to rest for he is a spirit and cannot tire he cannot want for light for he hath all light in himself And if God is all in all and worketh all in all as I have heard them read then it is impossible he should rest at all for if he did every other thing would stop and rest too the waters would not flow and the fishes could not swim and all motion must cease God could have no pauses in his work and he needed no Sabbaths of rest Man might need them and he should take them when he needed them whenever he required rest As it regarded the worship of God he was to be worshipped at all times and in all places and one portion of time never seemed to her more holy than another ' These views which were the result of the workings of her own mind assisted solely by the light of her own experience and very limited knowledge were for a long time after their adoption closely locked in her own breast fearing lest their avowal might bring upon her the imputation of 'infidelity ' the usual charge preferred by all religionists against those who entertain religious views and feelings differing materially from their own If from their own sad experience they are withheld from shouting the cry of 'infidel ' they fail not to see and to feel ay and to say that the dissenters are not of the right spirit and that their spiritual eyes have never been unsealed While travelling in Connecticut she met a minister with whom she held a long discussion on these points as well as on various other topics such as the origin of all things especially the origin of evil at the same time bearing her testimony strongly against a paid ministry He belonged to that class and as a matter of course as strongly advocated his own side of the question I had forgotten to mention in its proper place a very important fact that when she was examining the scriptures she wished to hear them without comment but if she employed adult persons to read them to her and she asked them to read a passage over again they invariably commenced to explain by giving her their version of it and in this way they tried her feelings exceedingly In consequence of this she ceased to ask adult persons to read the Bible to her and substituted children in their stead Children as soon as they could read distinctly would re read the same sentence to her as often as she wished and without comment and in that way she was enabled to see what her own mind could make out of the record and that she said was what she wanted and not what others thought it to mean She wished to compare the teachings of the Bible with the witness within her and she came to the conclusion that the spirit of truth spoke in those records but that the recorders of those truths had intermingled with them ideas and suppositions of their own This is one among the many proofs of her energy and independence of character When it became known to her children that Sojourner had left New York they were filled with wonder and alarm Where could she have gone and why had she left were questions no one could answer satisfactorily Now their imaginations painted her as a wandering maniac and again they feared she had been left to commit suicide and many were the tears they shed at the loss of her But when she reached Berlin Conn she wrote to them by amanuensis informing them of her whereabouts and waiting an answer to her letter thus quieting their fears and gladdening their hearts once more with assurances of her continued life and her love THE SECOND ADVENT DOCTRINES In Hartford and vicinity she met with several persons who believed in the 'Second Advent' doctrines or the immediate personal appearance of Jesus Christ At first she thought she had never heard of 'Second Advent ' But when it was explained to her she recollected having once attended Mr Miller's meeting in New York where she saw a great many enigmatical pictures hanging on the wall which she could not understand and which being out of the reach of her understanding failed to interest her In this section of country she attended two camp meetings of the believers in these doctrines the 'second advent' excitement being then at its greatest height The last meeting was at Windsor Lock The people as a matter of course eagerly inquired of her concerning her belief as it regarded their most important tenet She told them it had not been revealed to her perhaps if she could read she might see it differently Sometimes to their eager inquiry 'Oh don't you believe the Lord is coming ' she answered 'I believe the Lord is as near as he can be and not be it ' With these evasive and non exciting answers she kept their minds calm as it respected her unbelief till she could have an opportunity to hear their views fairly stated in order to judge more understandingly of this matter and see if in her estimation there was any good ground for expecting an event which was in the minds of so many as it were shaking the very foundations of the universe She was invited to join them in their religious exercises and accepted the invitation praying and talking in her own peculiar style and attracting many about her by her singing When she had convinced the people that she was a lover of God and his cause and had gained a good standing with them so that she could get a hearing among them she had become quite sure in her own mind that they were laboring under a delusion and she commenced to use her influence to calm the fears of the people and pour oil upon the troubled waters In one part of the grounds she found a knot of people greatly excited she mounted a stump and called out 'Hear hear ' When the people had gathered around her as they were in a state to listen to any thing new she addressed them as 'children ' and asked them why they made such a 'To do are you not commanded to watch and pray You are neither watching nor praying ' And she bade them with the tones of a kind mother retire to their tents and there watch and pray without noise or tumult for the Lord would not come to such a scene of confusion 'the Lord came still and quiet ' She assured them 'the Lord might come move all through the camp and go away again and they never know it ' in the state they then were They seemed glad to seize upon any reason for being less agitated and distressed and many of them suppressed their noisy terror and retired to their tents to 'watch and pray ' begging others to do the same and listen to the advice of the good sister She felt she had done some good and then went to listen further to the preachers They appeared to her to be doing their utmost to agitate and excite the people who were already too much excited and when she had listened till her feelings would let her listen silently no longer she arose and addressed the preachers The following are specimens of her speech 'Here you are talking about being changed in the twinkling of an eye If the Lord should come he'd change you to nothing for there is nothing to you 'You seem to be expecting to go to some parlor away up somewhere and when the wicked have been burnt you are coming back to walk in triumph over their ashes this is to be your New Jerusalem Now I can't see any thing so very nice in that coming back to such a muss as that will be a world covered with the ashes of the wicked Besides if the Lord comes and burns as you say he will I am not going away I am going to stay here and stand the fire like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego And Jesus will walk with me through the fire and keep me from harm Nothing belonging to God can burn any more than God himself such shall have no need to go away to escape the fire No I shall remain Do you tell me that God's children can't stand fire ' And her manner and tone spoke louder than words saying 'It is absurd to think so ' The ministers were taken quite aback at so unexpected an opposer and one of them in the kindest possible manner commenced a discussion with her by asking her questions and quoting scripture to her concluding finally that although she had learned nothing of the great doctrine which was so exclusively occupying their minds at the time she had learned much that man had never taught her At this meeting she received the address of different persons residing in various places with an invitation to visit them She promised to go soon to Cabotville and started shaping her course for that place She arrived at Springfield one evening at six o'clock and immediately began to search for a lodging for the night She walked from six till past nine and was then on the road from Springfield to Cabotville before she found any one sufficiently hospitable to give her a night's shelter under their roof Then a man gave her twenty five cents and bade her go to a tavern and stay all night She did so returning in the morning to thank him assuring him she had put his money to its legitimate use She found a number of the friends she had seen at Windsor when she reached the manufacturing town of Cabotville which has lately taken the name of Chicopee and with them she spent a pleasant week or more after which she left them to visit the Shaker village in Enfield She now began to think of finding a resting place at least for a season for she had performed quite a long journey considering she had walked most of the way and she had a mind to look in upon the Shakers and see how things were there and whether there was any opening there for her But on her way back to Springfield she called at a house and asked for a piece of bread her request was granted and she was kindly invited to tarry all night as it was getting late and she would not be able to stay at every house in that vicinity which invitation she cheerfully accepted When the man of the house came in he recollected having seen her at the camp meeting and repeated some conversations by which she recognized him again He soon proposed having a meeting that evening went out and notified his friends and neighbors who came together and she once more held forth to them in her peculiar style Through the agency of this meeting she became acquainted with several people residing in Springfield to whose houses she was cordially invited and with whom she spent some pleasant time One of these friends writing of her arrival there speaks as follows After saying that she and her people belonged to that class of persons who believed in the second advent doctrines and that this class believing also in freedom of speech and action often found at their meetings many singular people who did not agree with them in their principal doctrine and that being thus prepared to hear new and strange things 'They listened eagerly to Sojourner and drank in all she said ' and also that she 'soon became a favorite among them that when she arose to speak in their assemblies her commanding figure and dignified manner hushed every trifler into silence and her singular and sometimes uncouth modes of expression never provoked a laugh but often were the whole audience melted into tears by her touching stories ' She also adds 'Many were the lessons of wisdom and faith I have delighted to learn from her ' 'She continued a great favorite in our meetings both on account of her remarkable gift in prayer and still more remarkable talent for singing and the aptness and point of her remarks frequently illustrated by figures the most original and expressive 'As we were walking the other day she said she had often thought what a beautiful world this would be when we should see every thing right side up Now we see every thing topsy turvy and all is confusion ' For a person who knows nothing of this fact in the science of optics this seemed quite a remarkable idea 'We also loved her for her sincere and ardent piety her unwavering faith in God and her contempt of what the world calls fashion and what we call folly 'She was in search of a quiet place where a way worn traveller might rest She had heard of Fruitlands and was inclined to go there but the friends she found here thought it best for her to visit Northampton She passed her time while with us working wherever her work was needed and talking where work was not needed 'She would not receive money for her work saying she worked for the Lord and if her wants were supplied she received it as from the Lord 'She remained with us till far into winter when we introduced her at the Northampton Association ' 'She wrote to me from thence that she had found the quiet resting place she had so long desired And she has remained there ever since ' ANOTHER CAMP MEETING When Sojourner had been at Northampton a few months she attended another camp meeting at which she performed a very important part A party of wild young men with no motive but that of entertaining themselves by annoying and injuring the feelings of others had assembled at the meeting hooting and yelling and in various ways interrupting the services and causing much disturbance Those who had the charge of the meeting having tried their persuasive powers in vain grew impatient and tried threatening The young men considering themselves insulted collected their friends to the number of a hundred or more dispersed themselves through the grounds making the most frightful noises and threatening to fire the tents It was said the authorities of the meeting sat in grave consultation decided to have the ring leaders arrested and sent for the constable to the great displeasure of some of the company who were opposed to such an appeal to force and arms Be that as it may Sojourner seeing great consternation depicted in every countenance caught the contagion and ere she was aware found herself quaking with fear Under the impulse of this sudden emotion she fled to the most retired corner of a tent and secreted herself behind a trunk saying to herself 'I am the only colored person here and on me probably their wicked mischief will fall first and perhaps fatally ' But feeling how great her insecurity even there as the very tent began to shake from its foundations she began to soliloquize as follows 'Shall I run away and hide from the Devil Me a servant of the living God Have I not faith enough to go out and quell that mob when I know it is written One shall chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight I know there are not a thousand here and I know I am a servant of the living God I'll go to the rescue and the Lord shall go with and protect me 'Oh ' said she 'I felt as if I had three hearts and that they were so large my body could hardly hold them ' She now came forth from her hiding place and invited several to go with her and see what they could do to still the raging of the moral elements They declined and considered her wild to think of it The meeting was in the open fields the full moon shed its saddened light over all and the woman who was that evening to address them was trembling on the preachers' stand The noise and confusion were now terrific Sojourner left the tent alone and unaided and walking some thirty rods to the top of a small rise of ground commenced to sing in her most fervid manner with all the strength of her most powerful voice the hymn on the resurrection of Christ 'It was early in the morning it was early in the morning Just at the break of day When he rose when he rose when he rose And went to heaven on a cloud ' All who have ever heard her sing this hymn will probably remember it as long as they remember her The hymn the tune the style are each too closely associated with to be easily separated from herself and when sung in one of her most animated moods in the open air with the utmost strength of her most powerful voice must have been truly thrilling As she commenced to sing the young men made a rush towards her and she was immediately encircled by a dense body of the rioters many of them armed with sticks or clubs as their weapons of defence if not of attack As the circle narrowed around her she ceased singing and after a short pause inquired in a gentle but firm tone 'Why do you come about me with clubs and sticks I am not doing harm to any one ' 'We ar'n't a going to hurt you old woman we came to hear you sing ' cried many voices simultaneously 'Sing to us old woman ' cries one 'Talk to us old woman ' says another 'Pray old woman ' says a third 'Tell us your experience ' says a fourth 'You stand and smoke so near me I cannot sing or talk ' she answered 'Stand back ' said several authoritative voices with not the most gentle or courteous accompaniments raising their rude weapons in the air The crowd suddenly gave back the circle became larger as many voices again called for singing talking or praying backed by assurances that no one should be allowed to hurt her the speakers declaring with an oath that they would 'knock down' any person who should offer her the least indignity She looked about her and with her usual discrimination said inwardly 'Here must be many young men in all this assemblage bearing within them hearts susceptible of good impressions I will speak to them ' She did speak they silently heard and civilly asked her many questions It seemed to her to be given her at the time to answer them with truth and wisdom beyond herself Her speech had operated on the roused passions of the mob like oil on agitated waters they were as a whole entirely subdued and only clamored when she ceased to speak or sing Those who stood in the background after the circle was enlarged cried out 'Sing aloud old woman we can't hear ' Those who held the sceptre of power among them requested that she should make a pulpit of a neighboring wagon She said 'If I do they'll overthrow it ' 'No they sha'n't he who dares hurt you we'll knock him down instantly d n him ' cried the chiefs 'No we won't no we won't nobody shall hurt you ' answered the many voices of the mob They kindly assisted her to mount the wagon from which she spoke and sung to them about an hour Of all she said to them on the occasion she remembers only the following 'Well there are two congregations on this ground It is written that there shall be a separation and the sheep shall be separated from the goats The other preachers have the sheep I have the goats And I have a few sheep among my goats but they are very ragged ' This exordium produced great laughter When she became wearied with talking she began to cast about her to contrive some way to induce them to disperse While she paused they loudly clamored for 'more ' 'more ' 'sing ' 'sing more ' She motioned them to be quiet and called out to them 'Children I have talked and sung to you as you asked me and now I have a request to make of you will you grant it ' 'Yes yes yes ' resounded from every quarter 'Well it is this ' she answered 'if I will sing one more hymn for you will you then go away and leave us this night in peace ' 'Yes yes ' came faintly feebly from a few 'I repeat it ' says Sojourner 'and I want an answer from you all as of one accord If I will sing you one more you will go away and leave us this night in peace ' 'Yes yes yes ' shouted many voices with hearty emphasis 'I repeat my request once more ' said she 'and I want you all to answer ' And she reiterated the words again This time a long loud 'Yes yes yes ' came up as from the multitudinous mouth of the entire mob 'AMEN it is SEALED ' repeated Sojourner in the deepest and most solemn tones of her powerful and sonorous voice Its effect ran through the multitude like an electric shock and the most of them considered themselves bound by their promise as they might have failed to do under less imposing circumstances Some of them began instantly to leave others said 'Are we not to have one more hymn ' 'Yes ' answered their entertainer and she commenced to sing 'I bless the Lord I've got my seal to day and to day To slay Goliath in the field to day and to day The good old way is a righteous way I mean to take the kingdom in the good old way ' While singing she heard some enforcing obedience to their promise while a few seemed refusing to abide by it But before she had quite concluded she saw them turn from her and in the course of a few minutes they were running as fast as they well could in a solid body and she says she can compare them to nothing but a swarm of bees so dense was their phalanx so straight their course so hurried their march As they passed with a rush very near the stand of the other preachers the hearts of the people were smitten with fear thinking their entertainer had failed to enchain them longer with her spell and that they were coming upon them with redoubled and remorseless fury But they found they were mistaken and that their fears were groundless for before they could well recover from their surprise every rioter was gone and not one was left on the grounds or seen there again during the meeting Sojourner was informed that as her audience reached the main road some distance from the tents a few of the rebellious spirits refused to go on and proposed returning but their leaders said 'No we have promised to leave all promised and we must go all go and you shall none of you return again ' She did not fall in love at first sight with the Northampton Association for she arrived there at a time when appearances did not correspond with the ideas of associationists as they had been spread out in their writings for their phalanx was a factory and they were wanting in means to carry out their ideas of beauty and elegance as they would have done in different circumstances But she thought she would make an effort to tarry with them one night though that seemed to her no desirable affair But as soon as she saw that accomplished literary and refined persons were living in that plain and simple manner and submitting to the labors and privations incident to such an infant institution she said 'Well if these can live here I can ' Afterwards she gradually became pleased with and attached to the place and the people as well she might for it must have been no small thing to have found a home in a 'Community composed of some of the choicest spirits of the age ' where all was characterized by an equality of feeling a liberty of thought and speech and a largeness of soul she could not have before met with to the same extent in any of her wanderings Our first knowledge of her was derived from a friend who had resided for a time in the 'Community ' and who after describing her and singing one of her hymns wished that we might see her But we little thought at that time that we should ever pen these 'simple annals' of this child of nature When we first saw her she was working with a hearty good will saying she would not be induced to take regular wages believing as once before that now Providence had provided her with a never failing fount from which her every want might be perpetually supplied through her mortal life In this she had calculated too fast For the Associationists found that taking every thing into consideration they would find it most expedient to act individually and again the subject of this sketch found her dreams unreal and herself flung back upon her own resources for the supply of her needs This she might have found more inconvenient at her time of life for labor exposure and hardship had made sad inroads upon her iron constitution by inducing chronic disease and premature old age had she not remained under the shadow of one GEORGE W BENSON who never wearies in doing good giving to the needy and supplying the wants of the destitute She has now set her heart upon having a little home of her own even at this late hour of life where she may feel a greater freedom than she can in the house of another and where she can repose a little after her day of action has passed by And for such a 'home' she is now dependent on the charities of the benevolent and to them we appeal with confidence Through all the scenes of her eventful life may be traced the energy of a naturally powerful mind the fearlessness and child like simplicity of one untrammelled by education or conventional customs purity of character an unflinching adherence to principle and a native enthusiasm which under different circumstances might easily have produced another Joan of Arc With all her fervor and enthusiasm and speculation her religion is not tinctured in the least with gloom No doubt no hesitation no despondency spreads a cloud over her soul but all is bright clear positive and at times ecstatic Her trust is in God and from him she looks for good and not evil She feels that 'perfect love casteth out fear ' Having more than once found herself awaking from a mortifying delusion as in the case of the Sing Sing kingdom and resolving not to be thus deluded again she has set suspicion to guard the door of her heart and allows it perhaps to be aroused by too slight causes on certain subjects her vivid imagination assisting to magnify the phantoms of her fears into gigantic proportions much beyond their real size instead of resolutely adhering to the rule we all like best when it is to be applied to ourselves that of placing every thing we see to the account of the best possible motive until time and circumstance prove that we were wrong Where no good motive can be assigned it may become our duty to suspend our judgment till evidence can be had In the application of this rule it is an undoubted duty to exercise a commendable prudence by refusing to repose any important trust to the keeping of persons who may be strangers to us and whose trustworthiness we have never seen tried But no possible good but incalculable evil may and does arise from the too common practice of placing all conduct the source of which we do not fully understand to the worst of intentions How often is the gentle timid soul discouraged and driven perhaps to despondency by finding its 'good evil spoken of ' and a well meant but mistaken action loaded with an evil design If the world would but sedulously set about reforming itself on this one point who can calculate the change it would produce the evil it would annihilate and the happiness it would confer None but an all seeing eye could at once embrace so vast a result A result how desirable and one that can be brought about only by the most simple process that of every individual seeing to it that he commit not this sin himself For why should we allow in ourselves the very fault we most dislike when committed against us Shall we not at least aim at consistency Had she possessed less generous self sacrifice more knowledge of the world and of business matters in general and had she failed to take it for granted that others were like herself and would when her turn came to need do as she had done and find it 'more blessed to give than to receive ' she might have laid by something for the future For few perhaps have ever possessed the power and inclination in the same degree at one and the same time to labor as she has done both day and night for so long a period of time And had these energies been well directed and the proceeds well husbanded since she has been her own mistress they would have given her an independence during her natural life But her constitutional biases and her early training or rather want of training prevented this result and it is too late now to remedy the great mistake Shall she then be left to want Who will not answer 'No ' LAST INTERVIEW WITH HER MASTER In the spring of Sojourner made a visit to her eldest daughter Diana who has ever suffered from ill health and remained with Mr Dumont Isabella's humane master She found him still living though advanced in age and reduced in property as he had been for a number of years but greatly enlightened on the subject of slavery He said he could then see that 'slavery was the wickedest thing in the world the greatest curse the earth had ever felt that it was then very clear to his mind that it was so though while he was a slaveholder himself he did not see it so and thought it was as right as holding any other property ' Sojourner remarked to him that it might be the same with those who are now slaveholders 'O no ' replied he with warmth 'it cannot be For now the sin of slavery is so clearly written out and so much talked against why the whole world cries out against it that if any one says he don't know and has not heard he must I think be a liar In my slaveholding days there were few that spoke against it and these few made little impression on any one Had it been as it is now think you I could have held slaves No I should not have dared to do it but should have emancipated every one of them Now it is very different all may hear if they will ' Yes reader if any one feels that the tocsin of alarm or the anti slavery trump must sound a louder note before they can hear it one would think they must be very hard of hearing yea that they belong to that class of whom it may be truly said 'they have stopped their ears that they may not hear ' She received a letter from her daughter Diana dated Hyde Park December which informed her that Mr Dumont had 'gone West' with some of his sons that he had taken along with him probably through mistake the few articles of furniture she had left with him 'Never mind ' says Sojourner 'what we give to the poor we lend to the Lord ' She thanked the Lord with fervor that she had lived to hear her master say such blessed things She recalled the lectures he used to give his slaves on speaking the truth and being honest and laughing she says he taught us not to lie and steal when he was stealing all the time himself and did not know it Oh how sweet to my mind was this confession And what a confession for a master to make to a slave A slaveholding master turned to a brother Poor old man may the Lord bless him and all slaveholders partake of his spirit END OF THE NARRATIVE APPENDIX Extract from 'Slavery as It Is ' SLAVERY A SYSTEM OF INHERENT CRUELTY BY THEODORE D WELD THIRTY HUNDRED THOUSAND PERSONS in this country men women and children are in SLAVERY Is slavery as a condition for human beings good bad or indifferent We submit the question without argument You have common sense and conscience and a human heart pronounce upon it You have a wife or a husband a child a father a mother a brother or a sister make the case your own make it theirs and bring in your verdict The case of Human Rights against Slavery has been adjudicated in the court of conscience times innumerable The same verdict has always been rendered 'Guilty ' the same sentence has always been pronounced 'Let it be accursed ' and human nature with her million echoes has rung it round the world in every language under heaven 'Let it be accursed Let it be accursed ' His heart is false to human nature who will not say 'Amen ' There is not a man on earth who does not believe that slavery is a curse Human beings may be inconsistent but human nature is true to herself She has uttered her testimony against slavery with a shriek ever since the monster was begotten and till it perishes amidst the execrations of the universe she will traverse the world on its track dealing her bolts upon its head and dashing against it her condemning brand We repeat it every man knows that slavery is a curse Whoever denies this his lips libel his heart Try him clank the chains in his ears and tell him they are for him give him an hour to prepare his wife and children for a life of slavery bid him make haste and get ready their necks for the yoke and their wrists for the coffle chains then look at his pale lips and trembling knees and you have nature's testimony against slavery At least thirty hundred thousand persons in these States are in this condition They were made slaves and are held such by force and by being put in fear and this for no crime Reader what have you to say of such treatment Is it right just benevolent Suppose I should seize you rob you of your liberty drive you into the field and make you work without pay as long as you live would that be justice and kindness or monstrous injustice and cruelty Now every body knows that the slaveholders do these things to the slaves every day and yet it is stoutly affirmed that they treat them well and kindly and that their tender regard for their slaves restrains their masters from inflicting cruelties upon them We shall go into no metaphysics to show the absurdity of this pretence The man who robs you every day is forsooth quite too tender hearted ever to cuff or kick you True he can snatch your money but he does it gently lest he should hurt you He can empty your pockets without qualms but if your stomach is empty it cuts him to the quick He can make you work a life time without pay but loves you too well to let you go hungry He fleeces you of your rights with a relish but is shocked if you work bareheaded in summer or in winter without warm stockings He can make you go without your liberty but never without a shirt He can crush in you all hope of bettering your condition by vowing that you shall die his slave but though he can coolly torture your feelings he is too compassionate to lacerate your back he can break your heart but he is very tender of your skin He can strip you of all protection and thus expose you to all outrages but if you are exposed to the weather half clad and half sheltered how yearn his tender bowels What slaveholders talk of treating men well and yet not only rob them of all they get and as fast as they get it but rob them of themselves also their very hands and feet all their muscles and limbs and senses their bodies and minds their time and liberty and earnings their free speech and rights of conscience their right to acquire knowledge and property and reputation and yet they who plunder them of all these would fain make us believe that their soft hearts ooze out so lovingly toward their slaves that they always keep them well housed and well clad never push them too hard in the field never make their dear backs smart nor let their dear stomachs get empty But there is no end to these absurdities Are slaveholders dunces or do they take all the rest of the world to be that they think to bandage our eyes with such thin gauzes Protesting their kind regard for those whom they hourly plunder of all they have and all they get What when they have seized their victims and annihilated all their rights still claim to be the special guardians of their happiness Plunderers of their liberty yet the careful suppliers of their wants Robbers of their earnings yet watchful sentinels round their interests and kind providers for their comfort Filching all their time yet granting generous donations for rest and sleep Stealing the use of their muscles yet thoughtful of their ease Putting them under drivers yet careful that they are not hard pushed Too humane forsooth to stint the stomachs of their slaves yet force their minds to starve and brandish over them pains and penalties if they dare reach forth for the smallest crumb of knowledge even a letter of the alphabet It is no marvel that slaveholders are always talking of their kind treatment of their slaves The only marvel is that men of sense can be gulled by such professions Despots always insist that they are merciful The greatest tyrants that ever dripped with blood have assumed the titles of 'most gracious ' 'most clement ' 'most merciful ' c and have ordered their crouching vassals to accost them thus When did not vice lay claim to those virtues which are the opposites of its habitual crimes The guilty according to their own showing are always innocent and cowards brave and drunkards sober and harlots chaste and pickpockets honest to a fault Every body understands this When a man's tongue grows thick and he begins to hiccough and walk cross legged we expect him as a matter of course to protest that he is not drunk so when a man is always singing the praises of his own honesty we instinctively watch his movements and look out for our pocket books Whoever is simple enough to be hoaxed by such professions should never be trusted in the streets without somebody to take care of him Human nature works out in slaveholders just as it does in other men and in American slaveholders just as in English French Turkish Algerine Roman and Grecian The Spartans boasted of their kindness to their slaves while they whipped them to death by thousands at the altars of their gods The Romans lauded their own mild treatment of their bondsmen while they branded their names on their flesh with hot irons and when old threw them into their fish ponds or like Cato 'the Just ' starved them to death It is the boast of the Turks that they treat their slaves as though they were their children yet their common name for them is 'dogs ' and for the merest trifles their feet are bastinadoed to a jelly or their heads clipped off with a scimetar The Portuguese pride themselves on their gentle bearing towards their slaves yet the streets of Rio Janeiro are filled with naked men and women yoked in pairs to carts and wagons and whipped by drivers like beasts of burden Slaveholders the world over have sung the praises of their tender mercies towards their slaves Even the wretches that plied the African slave trade tried to rebut Clarkson's proofs of their cruelties by speeches affidavits and published pamphlets setting forth the accommodations of the 'middle passage ' and their kind attentions to the comfort of those whom they had stolen from their homes and kept stowed away under hatches during a voyage of four thousand miles So according to the testimony of the autocrat of the Russias he exercises great clemency towards the Poles though he exiles them by thousands to the snows of Siberia and tramples them down by millions at home Who discredits the atrocities perpetrated by Ovando in Hispaniola Pizarro in Peru and Cortez in Mexico because they filled the ears of the Spanish Court with protestations of their benignant rule While they were yoking the enslaved natives like beasts to the draught working them to death by thousands in their mines hunting them with bloodhounds torturing them on racks and broiling them on beds of coals their representations to the mother country teemed with eulogies of their parental sway The bloody atrocities of Philip II in the expulsion of his Moorish subjects are matters of imperishable history Who disbelieves or doubts them And yet his courtiers magnified his virtues and chanted his clemency and his mercy while the wail of a million victims smitten down by a tempest of fire and slaughter let loose at his bidding rose above the Te Deums that thundered from all Spain's cathedrals When Louis XIV revoked the edict of Nantes and proclaimed two millions of his subjects free plunder for persecution when from the English channel to the Pyrennees the mangled bodies of the Protestants were dragged on reeking hurdles by a shouting populace he claimed to be 'the father of his people ' and wrote himself 'His most Christian Majesty ' That slaves in the United States are treated with barbarous inhumanity that they are over worked under fed wretchedly clad and lodged and have insufficient sleep that they are often made to wear round their necks iron collars armed with prongs to drag heavy chains and weights at their feet while working in the field and to wear yokes and bells and iron horns that they are often kept confined in the stocks day and night for weeks together made to wear gags in their mouths for hours or days have some of their front teeth torn out or broken off that they may be easily detected when they run away that they are frequently flogged with terrible severity have red pepper rubbed into their lacerated flesh and hot brine spirits of turpentine c poured over the gashes to increase the torture that they are often stripped naked their backs and limbs cut with knives bruised and mangled by scores and hundreds of blows with the paddle and terribly torn by the claws of cats drawn over them by their tormentors that they are often hunted with bloodhounds and shot down like beasts or torn in pieces by dogs that they are often suspended by the arms and whipped and beaten till they faint and when revived by restoratives beaten again till they faint and sometimes till they die that their ears are often cut off their eyes knocked out their bones broken their flesh branded with red hot irons that they are maimed mutilated and burned to death over slow fires are undeniable facts The enormities inflicted by slaveholders upon their slaves will never be discredited except by those who overlook the simple fact that he who holds human beings as his bona fide property regards them as property and not as persons this is his permanent state of mind towards them He does not contemplate slaves as human beings consequently does not treat them as such and with entire indifference sees them suffer privations and writhe under blows which if inflicted upon whites would fill him with horror and indignation He regards that as good treatment of slaves which would seem to him insufferable abuse if practised upon others and would denounce that as a monstrous outrage and horrible cruelty if perpetrated upon white men and women which he sees every day meted out to black slaves without perhaps ever thinking it cruel Accustomed all his life to regard them rather as domestic animals to hear them stormed at and to see them cuffed and caned and being himself in constant habit of treating them thus such practices have become to him a mere matter of course and make no impression on his mind True it is incredible that men should treat as chattels those whom they truly regard as human beings but that they should treat as chattels and working animals those whom they regard as such is no marvel The common treatment of dogs when they are in the way is to kick them out of it we see them every day kicked off of sidewalks and on Sabbaths out of churches yet as they are but dogs these do not strike us as outrages yet if we were to see men women and children our neighbors and friends kicked out of stores by merchants or out of churches by the deacons and sexton we should call the perpetrators inhuman wretches We have said that slaveholders regard their slaves not as human beings but as mere working animals or merchandise The whole vocabulary of slaveholders their laws their usages and their entire treatment of their slaves fully establish this The same terms are applied to slaves that are given to cattle They are called 'stock ' So when the children of slaves are spoken of prospectively they are called their 'increase ' the same term that is applied to flocks and herds So the female slaves that are mothers are called 'breeders ' till past child bearing and often the same terms are applied to the different sexes that are applied to the males and females among cattle Those who compel the labor of slaves and cattle have the same appellation 'drivers ' the names which they call them are the same and similar to those given to their horses and oxen The laws of slave States make them property equally with goats and swine they are levied upon for debt in the same way they are included in the same advertisements of public sales with cattle swine and asses when moved from one part of the country to another they are herded in droves like cattle and like them urged on by drivers their labor is compelled in the same way They are bought and sold and separated like cattle when exposed for sale their good qualities are described as jockeys show off the good points of their horses their strength activity skill power of endurance c are lauded and those who bid upon them examine their persons just as purchasers inspect horses and oxen they open their mouths to see if their teeth are sound strip their backs to see if they are badly scarred and handle their limbs and muscles to see if they are firmly knit Like horses they are warranted to be 'sound ' or to be returned to the owner if 'unsound ' A father gives his son a horse and slave by his will he distributes among them his racehorses hounds game cocks and slaves We leave the reader to carry out the parallel which we have only begun Its details would cover many s That slaveholders do not practically regard slaves as human beings is abundantly shown by their own voluntary testimony In a recent work entitled 'The South Vindicated from the Treason and Fanaticism of Northern Abolitionists ' which was written we are informed by Colonel Dayton late member of Congress from South Carolina the writer speaking of the awe with which the slaves regard the whites says 'The Northerner looks upon a band of negroes as upon so many men but the planter or Southerner views them in a very different light ' Extract from a speech of Mr SUMMERS of Virginia in the Legislature of that State January See the Richmond Whig 'When in the sublime lessons of Christianity he the slaveholder is taught to do unto others as he would have others do unto him HE NEVER DREAMS THAT THE DEGRADED NEGRO IS WITHIN THE PALE OF THAT HOLY CANON ' PRESIDENT JEFFERSON in his letter to GOVERNOR COLES of Illinois dated August asserts that slaveholders regard their slaves as brutes in the following remarkable language 'Nursed and educated in the daily habit of seeing the degraded condition both bodily and mental of these unfortunate beings the slaves FEW MINDS HAVE YET DOUBTED BUT THAT THEY WERE AS LEGITIMATE SUBJECTS OF PROPERTY AS THEIR HORSES OR CATTLE ' Having shown that slaveholders regard their slaves as mere working animals and cattle we now proceed to show that their actual treatment of them is worse than it would be if they were brutes We repeat it SLAVEHOLDERS TREAT THEIR SLAVES WORSE THAN THEY DO THEIR BRUTES Whoever heard of cows or sheep being deliberately tied up and beaten and lacerated till they died or horses coolly tortured by the hour till covered with mangled flesh or of swine having their legs tied and being suspended from a tree and lacerated with thongs for hours or of hounds stretched and made fast at full length flayed with whips red pepper rubbed into their bleeding gashes and hot brine dashed on to aggravate the torture Yet just such forms and degrees of torture are daily perpetrated upon the slaves Now no man that knows human nature will marvel at this Though great cruelties have always been inflicted by men upon brutes yet incomparably the most horrid ever perpetrated have been those of men upon their own species Any leaf of history turned over at random has proof enough of this Every reflecting mind perceives that when men hold human beings as property they must from the nature of the case treat them worse than they treat their horses and oxen It is impossible for cattle to excite in men such tempests of fury as men excite in each other Men are often provoked if their horses or hounds refuse to do or their pigs refuse to go where they wish to drive them but the feeling is rarely intense and never permanent It is vexation and impatience rather than settled rage malignity or revenge If horses and dogs were intelligent beings and still held as property their opposition to the wishes of their owners would exasperate them immeasurably more than it would be possible for them to do with the minds of brutes None but little children and idiots get angry at sticks and stones that lie in their way or hurt them but put into sticks and stones intelligence and will and power of feeling and motion while they remain as now articles of property and what a towering rage would men be in if bushes whipped them in the face when they walked among them or stones rolled over their toes when they climbed hills and what exemplary vengeance would be inflicted upon door steps and hearth stones if they were to move out of their places instead of lying still where they were put for their owners to tread upon The greatest provocation to human nature is opposition to its will If a man's will be resisted by one far below him the provocation is vastly greater than when it is resisted by an acknowledged superior In the former case it inflames strong passions which in the latter lie dormant The rage of proud Haman knew no bounds against the poor Jew who would not do as he wished and so he built a gallows for him If the person opposing the will of another be so far below him as to be on a level with chattels and be actually held and used as an article of property pride scorn lust of power rage and revenge explode together upon the hapless victim The idea of property having a will and that too in opposition to the will of its owner and counteracting it is a stimulant of terrible power to the most relentless human passions and from the nature of slavery and the constitution of the human mind this fierce stimulant must with various degrees of strength act upon slaveholders almost without ceasing The slave however abject and crushed is an intelligent being he has a will and that will cannot be annihilated it will show itself if for a moment it is smothered like pent up fires when vent is found it flames the fiercer Make intelligence property and its manager will have his match he is met at every turn by an opposing will not in the form of downright rebellion and defiance but yet visibly an ever opposing will He sees it in the dissatisfied look and reluctant air and unwilling movement the constrained strokes of labor the drawling tones the slow hearing the feigned stupidity the sham pains and sickness the short memory and he feels it every hour in innumerable forms frustrating his designs by a ceaseless though perhaps invisible countermining This unceasing opposition to the will of its 'owner ' on the part of his rational 'property ' is to the slaveholder as the hot iron to the nerve He raves under it and storms gnashes and smites but the more he smites the hotter it gets and the more it burns him Further this opposition of the slave's will to his owner's not only excites him to severity that he may gratify his rage but makes it necessary for him to use violence in breaking down this resistance thus subjecting the slave to additional tortures There is another inducement to cruel inflictions upon the slave and a necessity for it which does not exist in the case of brutes Offenders must be made an example to others to strike them with terror If a slave runs away and is caught his master flogs him with terrible severity not merely to gratify his resentment and to keep him from running away again but as a warning to others So in every case of disobedience neglect stubbornness unfaithfulness indolence insolence theft feigned sickness when his directions are forgotten or slighted or supposed to be or his wishes crossed or his property injured or left exposed or his work ill executed the master is tempted to inflict cruelties not merely to wreak his own vengeance upon him and to make the slave more circumspect in future but to sustain his authority over the other slaves to restrain them from like practices and to preserve his own property A multitude of facts illustrating the position that slaveholders treat their slaves worse than they do their cattle will occur to all who are familiar with slavery When cattle break through their owners' inclosures and escape if found they are driven back and fastened in again and even slaveholders would execrate as a wretch the man who should tie them up and bruise and lacerate them for straying away but when slaves that have escaped are caught they are flogged with the most terrible severity When herds of cattle are driven to market they are suffered to go in the easiest way each by himself but when slaves are driven to market they are fastened together with handcuffs galled by iron collars and chains and thus forced to travel on foot hundreds of miles sleeping at night in their chains Sheep and sometimes horned cattle are marked with their owners' initials but this is generally done with paint and of course produces no pain Slaves too are often marked with their owners' initials but the letters are stamped into their flesh with a hot iron Cattle are suffered to graze their pastures without stint but the slaves are restrained in their food to a fixed allowance The slaveholders' horses are notoriously far better fed more moderately worked have fewer hours of labor and longer intervals of rest than their slaves and their valuable horses are far more comfortably housed and lodged and their stables more effectually defended from the weather than the slaves' huts These objectors can really believe the fact that in the city of New York less than a hundred years since thirteen persons were publicly burned to death over a slow fire and that the legislature of the same State took under its paternal care the African slave trade and declared that 'all encouragement should be given to the direct importation of slaves that all smuggling of slaves should be condemned as an eminent discouragement to the fair trader ' They do not call in question the fact that the African slave trade was carried on from the ports of the free States till within thirty years that even members of the Society of Friends were actively engaged in it shortly before the revolutionary war See Life and Travels of John Woolman that as late as no less than fifty nine of the vessels engaged in that trade were sent out from the little State of Rhode Island which had then only about seventy thousand inhabitants that among those most largely engaged in those foul crimes are the men whom the people of Rhode Island delight to honor that the man who dipped most deeply in that trade of blood James de Wolf and amassed a most princely fortune by it was not long since their Senator in Congress and another who was captain of one of his vessels was recently Lieutenant Governor of the State They can believe too all the horrors of the middle passage the chains suffocation maimings stranglings starvation and cold blooded murders atrocities perpetrated on board these slave ships by their own citizens perhaps by their own townsmen and neighbors possibly by their own fathers but O they 'can't believe that the slaveholders can be so hard hearted towards their slaves as to treat them with great cruelty ' They can believe that His Holiness the Pope with his cardinals bishops and priests have tortured broken on the wheel and burned to death thousands of Protestants that eighty thousand of the Anabaptists were slaughtered in Germany that hundreds of thousands of the blameless Waldenses Huguenots and Lollards were torn in pieces by the most titled dignitaries of church and state and that almost every professedly Christian sect has at some period of its history persecuted unto blood those who dissented from their creed They can believe also that in Boston New York Utica Philadelphia Cincinnati Alton and scores of other cities and villages of the free States 'gentlemen of property and standing ' led on by civil officers by members of State legislatures and of Congress by judges and attorneys general by editors of newspapers and by professed ministers of the gospel have organized mobs broken up lawful meetings of peaceable citizens committed assault and battery upon their persons knocked them down with stones led them about with ropes dragged them from their beds at midnight gagged and forced them into vehicles and driven them into unfrequented places and there tormented and disfigured them that they have rifled their houses made bonfires of their furniture in the streets burned to the ground or torn in pieces the halls or churches in which they were assembled attacked them with deadly weapons stabbed some shot others and killed one They can believe all this and further that a majority of the citizens in the places where these outrages have been committed connived at them and by refusing to indict the perpetrators or if they were indicted by combining to secure their acquittal and rejoicing in it have publicly adopted these felonies as their own All these things they can believe without hesitation and that they have even been done by their own acquaintances neighbors relatives perhaps those with whom they interchange courtesies those for whom they vote or to whose salaries they contribute but yet O they can never believe that slaveholders inflict cruelties upon their slaves They can give full credence to the kidnapping imprisonment and deliberate murder of WILLIAM MORGAN and that by men of high standing in society they can believe that this deed was aided and abetted and the murderers screened from justice by a large number of influential persons who were virtually accomplices either before or after the fact and that this combination was so effectual as successfully to defy and triumph over the combined powers of the government yet that those who constantly rob men of their time liberty and wages and all their rights should rob them of bits of flesh and occasionally of a tooth make their backs bleed and put fetters on their legs is too monstrous to be credited Further these same persons who 'can't believe' that slaveholders are so iron hearted as to ill treat their slaves believe that the very elite of these slaveholders those most highly esteemed and honored among them are continually daring each other to mortal conflict and in the presence of mutual friends taking deadly aim at each other's hearts with settled purpose to kill if possible That among the most distinguished Governors of slave States among their most celebrated judges senators and representatives in Congress there is hardly one who has not either killed or tried to kill or aided and abetted his friends in trying to kill one or more individuals That pistols dirks bowie knives or other instruments of death are generally carried throughout the slave States and that deadly affrays with them in the streets of their cities and villages are matters of daily occurrence that the sons of slaveholders in southern colleges bully threaten and fire upon their teachers and their teachers upon them that during the last summer in the most celebrated seat of science and literature in the South the University of Virginia the professors were attacked by more than seventy armed students and in the words of a Virginia paper were obliged 'to conceal themselves from their fury ' also that almost all the riots and violence that occur in northern colleges are produced by the turbulence and lawless passions of southern students That such are the furious passions of slaveholders no considerations of personal respect none for the proprieties of life none for the honor of our national legislature none for the character of our country abroad can restrain the slaveholding members of Congress from the most disgraceful personal encounters on the floor of our nation's legislature smiting their fists in each other's faces throttling and even kicking and trying to gouge each other that during the session of the Congress just closed no less than six slaveholders taking fire at words spoken in debate have either rushed at each other's throats or kicked or struck or attempted to knock each other down and that in all these instances they would doubtless have killed each other if their friends had not separated them Further they know full well these were not insignificant vulgar blackguards elected because they were the head bullies and bottle holders in a boxing ring or because their constituents went drunk to the ballot box but they were some of the most conspicuous members of the House one of them a former Speaker Our newspapers are full of these and similar daily occurrences among slaveholders copied verbatim from their own accounts of them in their own papers and all this we fully credit no man is simpleton enough to cry out 'O I can't believe that slaveholders do such things ' and yet when we turn to the treatment which these men mete out to their slaves and show that they are in the habitual practice of striking kicking knocking down and shooting them as well as each other the look of blank incredulity that comes over northern dough faces is a study for a painter and then the sentimental outcry with eyes and hands uplifted 'Oh indeed I can't believe the slaveholders are so cruel to their slaves ' Most amiable and touching charity Arbitrary power is to the mind what alcohol is to the body it intoxicates Man loves power It is perhaps the strongest human passion and the more absolute the power the stronger the desire for it and the more it is desired the more its exercise is enjoyed this enjoyment is to human nature a fearful temptation generally an over match for it Hence it is true with hardly an exception that arbitrary power is abused in proportion as it is desired The fact that a person intensely desires power over others without restraint shows the absolute necessity of restraint What woman would marry a man who made it a condition that he should have the power to divorce her whenever he pleased Oh he might never wish to exercise it but the power he would have No woman not stark mad would trust her happiness in such hands Would a father apprentice his son to a master who insisted that his power over the lad should be absolute The master might perhaps never wish to commit a battery upon the boy but if he should he insists upon having full swing He who would leave his son in the clutches of such a wretch would be bled and blistered for a lunatic as soon as his friends could get their hands upon him The possession of power even when greatly restrained is such a fiery stimulant that its lodgment in human hands is always perilous Give men the handling of immense sums of money and all the eyes of Argus and the hands of Briareus can hardly prevent embezzlement That American slaveholders possess a power over their slaves which is virtually absolute none will deny The following extracts from the laws of slave States are proofs sufficient 'The slave is ENTIRELY subject to the WILL of his master Louisiana Civil Code Art 'Slaves shall be deemed sold taken reputed and adjudged in law to be chattels personal in the hands of their owners and possessors and their executors administrators and assigns TO ALL INTENTS CONSTRUCTIONS AND PURPOSES WHATSOEVER ' Laws of South Carolina Brev Dig Prince's Digest c That they desire this absolute power is shown from the fact of their holding and exercising it and making laws to confirm and enlarge it That the desire to possess this power every tittle of it is intense is proved by the fact that slaveholders cling to it with such obstinate tenacity as well as by all their doings and sayings their threats cursings and gnashings against all who denounce the exercise of such power as usurpation and outrage and counsel its immediate abrogation From the nature of the case from the laws of mind such power so intensely desired griped with such a death clutch and with such fierce spurnings of all curtailment or restraint cannot but be abused Privations and inflictions must be its natural habitual products with ever and anon terror torture and despair let loose to do their worst upon their helpless victims Slaveholders organize themselves into a tribunal to adjudicate upon their own conduct and give us in their decisions their estimate of their own character informing us with characteristic modesty that they have a high opinion of themselves that in their own judgment they are very mild kind and merciful gentlemen In these conceptions of their own merits and of the eminent propriety of their bearing towards their slaves slaveholders remind us of the Spaniard who always took off his hat whenever he spoke of himself and of the Governor of Schiraz who from a sense of justice to his own character added to his other titles those of 'Flower of Courtesy ' 'Nutmeg of Consolation ' and 'Rose of Delight ' When men speak of the treatment of others as being either good or bad their declarations are not generally to be taken as testimony to matters of fact so much as expressions of their own feelings towards those persons or classes who are the subjects of such treatment If those persons are their fellow citizens if they are in the same class of society with themselves of the same language creed and color similar in their habits pursuits and sympathies they will keenly feel any wrong done to them and denounce it as base outrageous treatment but let the same wrongs be done to persons of a condition in all respects the reverse persons whom they habitually despise and regard only in the light of mere conveniences to be used for their pleasure and the idea that such treatment is barbarous will be laughed at as ridiculous When we hear slaveholders say that their slaves are well treated we have only to remember that they are not speaking of persons but of property not of men and women but of chattels and things not of friends and associates but of vassals and victims not of those whom they respect and honor but of those whom they scorn and trample on not of those with whom they sympathize and co operate and interchange courtesies but of those whom they regard with contempt and aversion and disdainfully set with the dogs of their flock Reader keep this fact in your mind and you will have a clue to the slaveholder's definition of 'good treatment ' CERTIFICATES OF CHARACTER

SEPARATION OF ELIZA AND HER LAST CHILD CHAPIN RESCUES SOLOMON FROM HANGING THE STAKING OUT AND FLOGGING OF THE GIRL PATSEY SCENE IN THE COTTON FIELD AND SOLOMON'S DELIVERY ARRIVAL HOME AND FIRST MEETING WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN xv EDITOR'S PREFACE When the editor commenced the preparation of the following narrative he did not suppose it would reach the size of this volume In order however to present all the facts which have been communicated to him it has seemed necessary to extend it to its present length Many of the statements contained in the following s are corroborated by abundant evidence others rest entirely upon Solomon's assertion That he has adhered strictly to the truth the editor at least who has had an opportunity of detecting any contradiction or discrepancy in his statements is well satisfied He has invariably repeated the same story without deviating in the slightest particular and has also carefully perused the manuscript dictating an alteration wherever the most trivial inaccuracy has appealed It was Solomon's fortune during his captivity to be owned by several masters The treatment he received while at the Pine Woods shows that among slaveholders there are men of humanity as well of cruelty Some of them are spoken of with emotions of gratitude others in a spirit of bitterness It is xvi believed that the following account of his experience on Bayou Boeuf presents a correct picture of Slavery in all its lights and shadows as it now exists in that locality Unbiased as he conceives by any prepossessions or prejudices the only object of the editor has been to give a faithful history of Solomon Northup's life as he received it from his lips In the accomplishment of that object he trusts he has succeeded notwithstanding the numerous faults of style and of expression it may be found to contain DAVID WILSON WHITEHALL N Y May NARRATIVE OF SOLOMON NORTHUP I INTRODUCTORY ANCESTRY THE NORTHUP FAMILY BIRTH AND PARENTAGE MINTUS NORTHUP MARRIAGE WITH ANNE HAMPTON GOOD RESOLUTIONS CHAMPLAIN CANAL RAFTING EXCURSION TO CANADA FARMING THE VIOLIN COOKING REMOVAL TO SARATOGA PARKER AND PERRY SLAVES AND SLAVERY THE CHILDREN THE BEGINNING OF SORROW Having been born a freeman and for more than thirty years enjoyed the blessings of liberty in a free State and having at the end of that time been kidnapped and sold into Slavery where I remained until happily rescued in the month of January after a bondage of twelve years it has been suggested that an account of my life and fortunes would not be uninteresting to the public Since my return to liberty I have not failed to perceive the increasing interest throughout the Northern States in regard to the subject of Slavery Works of fiction professing to portray its features in their more pleasing as well as more repugnant aspects have been circulated to an extent unprecedented and as I understand have created a fruitful topic of comment and discussion I can speak of Slavery only so far as it came under my own observation only so far as I have known and experienced it in my own person My object is to give a candid and truthful statement of facts to repeat the story of my life without exaggeration leaving it for others to determine whether even the s of fiction present a picture of more cruel wrong or a severer bondage As far back as I have been able to ascertain my ancestors on the paternal side were slaves in Rhode Island They belonged to a family by the name of Northup one of whom removing to the State of New York settled at Hoosic in Rensselaer county He brought with him Mintus Northup my father On the death of this gentleman which must have occurred some fifty years ago my father became free having been emancipated by a direction in his will Henry B Northup Esq of Sandy Hill a distinguished counselor at law and the man to whom under Providence I am indebted for my present liberty and my return to the society of my wife and children is a relative of the family in which my forefathers were thus held to service and from which they took the name I bear To this fact may be attributed the persevering interest he has taken in my behalf Sometime after my father's liberation he removed to the town of Minerva Essex county N Y where I was born in the month of July How long he remained in the latter place I have not the means of definitely ascertaining From thence he removed to Granville Washington county near a place known as Slyborough where for some years he labored on the farm of Clark Northup also a relative of his old master from thence he removed to the Alden farm at Moss Street a short distance north of the village of Sandy Hill and from thence to the farm now owned by Russel Pratt situated on the road leading from Fort Edward to Argyle where he continued to reside until his death which took place on the d day of November He left a widow and two children myself and Joseph an elder brother The latter is still living in the county of Oswego near the city of that name my mother died during the period of my captivity Though born a slave and laboring under the disadvantages to which my unfortunate race is subjected my father was a man respected for his industry and integrity as many now living who well remember him are ready to testify His whole life was passed in the peaceful pursuits of agriculture never seeking employment in those more menial positions which seem to be especially allotted to the children of Africa Besides giving us an education surpassing that ordinarily bestowed upon children in our condition he acquired by his diligence and economy a sufficient property qualification to entitle him to the right of suffrage He was accustomed to speak to us of his early life and although at all times cherishing the warmest emotions of kindness and even of affection towards the family in whose house he had been a bondsman he nevertheless comprehended the system of Slavery and dwelt with sorrow on the degradation of his race He endeavored to imbue our minds with sentiments of morality and to teach us to place our trust and confidence in Him who regards the humblest as well as the highest of his creatures How often since that time has the recollection of his paternal counsels occurred to me while lying in a slave hut in the distant and sickly regions of Louisiana smarting with the undeserved wounds which an inhuman master had inflicted and longing only for the grave which had covered him to shield me also from the lash of the oppressor In the church yard at Sandy Hill an humble stone marks the spot where he reposes after having worthily performed the duties appertaining to the lowly sphere wherein God had appointed him to walk Up to this period I had been principally engaged with my father in the labors of the farm The leisure hours allowed me were generally either employed over my books or playing on the violin an amusement which was the ruling passion of my youth It has also been the source of consolation since affording pleasure to the simple beings with whom my lot was cast and beguiling my own thoughts for many hours from the painful contemplation of my fate On Christmas day I was married to Anne Hampton a colored girl then living in the vicinity of our residence The ceremony was performed at Fort Edward by Timothy Eddy Esq a magistrate of that town and still a prominent citizen of the place She had resided a long time at Sandy Hill with Mr Baird proprietor of the Eagle Tavern and also in the family of Rev Alexander Proudfit of Salem This gentleman for many years had presided over the Presbyterian society at the latter place and was widely distinguished for his learning and piety Anne still holds in grateful remembrance the exceeding kindness and the excellent counsels of that good man She is not able to determine the exact line of her descent but the blood of three races mingles in her veins It is difficult to tell whether the red white or black predominates The union of them all however in her origin has given her a singular but pleasing expression such as is rarely to be seen Though somewhat resembling yet she cannot properly be styled a quadroon a class to which I have omitted to mention my mother belonged I had just now passed the period of my minority having reached the age of twenty one years in the month of July previous Deprived of the advice and assistance of my father with a wife dependent upon me for support I resolved to enter upon a life of industry and notwithstanding the obstacle of color and the consciousness of my lowly state indulged in pleasant dreams of a good time coming when the possession of some humble habitation with a few surrounding acres should reward my labors and bring me the means of happiness and comfort From the time of my marriage to this day the love I have borne my wife has been sincere and unabated and only those who have felt the glowing tenderness a father cherishes for his offspring can appreciate my affection for the beloved children which have since been born to us This much I deem appropriate and necessary to day in order that those who read these s may comprehend the poignancy of those sufferings I have been doomed to bear Immediately upon our marriage we commenced house keeping in the old yellow building then standing at the southern extremity of Fort Edward village and which has since been transformed into a modern mansion and lately occupied by Captain Lathrop It is known as the Fort House In this building the courts were sometime held after the organization of the county It was also occupied by Burgoyne in being situated near the old Fort on the left bank of the Hudson During the winter I was employed with others repairing the Champlain Canal on that section over which William Van Nortwick was superintendent David McEachron had the immediate charge of the men in whose company I labored By the time the canal opened in the spring I was enabled from the savings of my wages to purchase a pair of horses and other things necessarily required in the business of navigation Having hired several efficient hands to assist me I entered into contracts for the transportation of large rafts of timber from Lake Champlain to Troy Dyer Beckwith and a Mr Bartemy of Whitehall accompanied me on several trips During the season I became perfectly familiar with the art and mysteries of rafting a knowledge which afterwards enabled me to render profitable service to a worthy master and to astonish the simple witted lumbermen on the banks of the Bayou Boeuf In one of my voyages down Lake Champlain I was induced to make a visit to Canada Repairing to Montreal I visited the cathedral and other places of interest in that city from whence I continued my excursion to Kingston and other towns obtaining a knowledge of localities which was also of service to me afterwards as will appear towards the close of this narrative Having completed my contracts on the canal satisfactorily to myself and to my employer and not wishing to remain idle now that the navigation of the canal was again suspended I entered into another contract with Medad Gunn to cut a large quantity of wood In this business I was engaged during the winter of With the return of spring Anne and myself conceived the project of taking a farm in the neighborhood I had been accustomed from earliest youth to agricultural labors and it was an occupation congenial to my tastes I accordingly entered into arrangements for a part of the old Alden farm on which my father formerly resided With one cow one swine a yoke of fine oxen I had lately purchased of Lewis Brown in Hartford and other personal property and effects we proceeded to our new home in Kingsbury That year I planted twenty five acres of corn sowed large fields of oats and commenced farming upon as large a scale as my utmost means would permit Anne was diligent about the house affairs while I toiled laboriously in the field On this place we continued to reside until In the winter season I had numerous calls to play on the violin Wherever the young people assembled to dance I was almost invariably there Throughout the surrounding villages my fiddle was notorious Anne also during her long residence at the Eagle Tavern had become somewhat famous as a cook During court weeks and on public occasions she was employed at high wages in the kitchen at Sherrill's Coffee House We always returned home from the performance of these services with money in our pockets so that with fiddling cooking and farming we soon found ourselves in the possession of abundance and in fact leading a happy and prosperous life Well indeed would it have been for us had we remained on the farm at Kingsbury but the time came when the next step was to be taken towards the cruel destiny that awaited me In March we removed to Saratoga Springs We occupied a house belonging to Daniel O'Brien on the north side of Washington street At that time Isaac Taylor kept a large boarding house known as Washington Hall at the north end of Broadway He employed me to drive a hack in which capacity I worked for him two years After this time I was generally employed through the visiting season as also was Anne in the United States Hotel and other public houses of the place In winter seasons I relied upon my violin though during the construction of the Troy and Saratoga railroad I performed many hard days' labor upon it I was in the habit at Saratoga of purchasing articles necessary for my family at the stores of Mr Cephas Parker and Mr William Perry gentlemen towards whom for many acts of kindness I entertained feelings of strong regard It was for this reason that twelve years afterwards I caused to be directed to them the letter which is hereinafter inserted and which was the means in the hands of Mr Northup of my fortunate deliverance While living at the United States Hotel I frequently met with slaves who had accompanied their masters from the South They were always well dressed and well provided for leading apparently an easy life with but few of its ordinary troubles to perplex them Many times they entered into conversation with me on the subject of Slavery Almost uniformly I found they cherished a secret desire for liberty Some of them expressed the most ardent anxiety to escape and consulted me on the best method of effecting it The fear of punishment however which they knew was certain to attend their re capture and return in all cases proved sufficient to deter them from the experiment Having all my life breathed the free air of the North and conscious that I possessed the same feelings and affections that find a place in the white man's breast conscious moreover of an intelligence equal to that of some men at least with a fairer skin I was too ignorant perhaps too independent to conceive how any one could be content to live in the abject condition of a slave I could not comprehend the justice of that law or that religion which upholds or recognizes the principle of Slavery and never once I am proud to say did I fail to counsel any one who came to me to watch his opportunity and strike for freedom I continued to reside at Saratoga until the spring of The flattering anticipations which seven years before had seduced us from the quiet farm house on the east side of the Hudson had not been realized Though always in comfortable circumstances we had not prospered The society and associations at that world renowned watering place were not calculated to preserve the simple habits of industry and economy to which I had been accustomed but on the contrary to substitute others in their stead tending to shiftlessness and extravagance At this time we were the parents of three children Elizabeth Margaret and Alonzo Elizabeth the eldest was in her tenth year Margaret was two years younger and little Alonzo had just passed his fifth birth day They filled our house with gladness Their young voices were music in our ears Many an airy castle did their mother and myself build for the little innocents When not at labor I was always walking with them clad in their best attire through the streets and groves of Saratoga Their presence was my delight and I clasped them to my bosom with as warm and tender love as if their clouded skins had been as white as snow Thus far the history of my life presents nothing whatever unusual nothing but the common hopes and loves and labors of an obscure colored man making his humble progress in the world But now I had reached a turning point in my existence reached the threshold of unutterable wrong and sorrow and despair Now had I approached within the shadow of the cloud into the thick darkness whereof I was soon to disappear thenceforward to be hidden from the eyes of all my kindred and shut out from the sweet light of liberty for many a weary year II THE TWO STRANGERS THE CIRCUS COMPANY DEPARTURE FROM SARATOGA VENTRILOQUISM AND LEGERDEMAIN JOURNEY TO NEW YORK FREE PAPERS BROWN AND HAMILTON THE HASTE TO REACH THE CIRCUS ARRIVAL IN WASHINGTON FUNERAL OF HARRISON THE SUDDEN SICKNESS THE TORMENT OF THIRST THE RECEDING LIGHT INSENSIBILITY CHAINS AND DARKNESS ONE morning towards the latter part of the month of March having at that time no particular business to engage my attention I was walking about the village of Saratoga Springs thinking to myself where I might obtain some present employment until the busy season should arrive Anne as was her usual custom had gone over to Sandy Hill a distance of some twenty miles to take charge of the Culinary department at Sherrill's Coffee House during the session of the court Elizabeth I think had accompanied her Margaret and Alonzo were with their aunt at Saratoga On the corner of Congress street and Broadway near the tavern then and for aught I know to the contrary still kept by Mr Moon I was met by two gentlemen of respectable appearance both of whom were entirely unknown to me I have the impression that they were introduced to me by some one of my acquaintances but who I have in vain endeavored to recall with the remark that I was an expert player on the violin At any rate they immediately entered into conversation on that subject making numerous inquiries touching my proficiency in that respect My responses being to all appearances satisfactory they proposed to engage my services for a short period stating at the same time I was just such a person as their business required Their names as they afterwards gave them to me were Merrill Brown and Abram Hamilton though whether these were their true appellations I have strong reasons to doubt The former was a man apparently forty years of age somewhat short and thick set with a countenance indicating shrewdness and intelligence He wore a black frock coat and black hat and said he resided either at Rochester or at Syracuse The latter was a young man of fair complexion and light eyes and I should judge had not passed the age of twenty five He was tall and slender dressed in a snuff colored coat with glossy hat and vest of elegant pattern His whole apparel was in the extreme of fashion His appearance was somewhat effeminate but prepossessing and there was about him an easy air that showed he had mingled with the world They were connected as they informed me with a circus company then in the city of Washington that they were on their way thither to rejoin it having left it for a short time to make an excursion northward for the purpose of seeing the country and were paying their expenses by an occasional exhibition They also remarked that they had found much difficulty in procuring music for their entertainments and that if I would accompany them as far as New York they would give me one dollar for each day's services and three dollars in addition for every night I played at their performances besides sufficient to pay the expenses of my return from New York to Saratoga I at once accepted the tempting offer both for the reward it promised and from a desire to visit the metropolis They were anxious to leave immediately Thinking my absence would be brief I did not deem it necessary to write to Anne whither I had gone in fact supposing that my return perhaps would be as soon as hers So taking a change of linen and my violin I was ready to depart The carriage was brought round a covered one drawn by a pair of noble bays altogether forming an elegant establishment Their baggage consisting of three large trunks was fastened on the rack and mounting to the driver's seat while they took their places in the rear I drove away from Saratoga on the road to Albany elated with my new position and happy as I had ever been on any day in all my life We passed through Ballston and striking the ridge road as it is called if my memory correctly serves me followed it direct to Albany We reached that city before dark and stopped at a hotel southward from the Museum This night I had an opportunity of witnessing one of their performances the only one during the whole period I was with them Hamilton was stationed at the door I formed the orchestra while Brown provided the entertainment It consisted in throwing balls dancing on the rope frying pancakes in a hat causing invisible pigs to squeal and other like feats of ventriloquism and legerdemain The audience was extraordinarily sparse and not of the selectest character at that and Hamilton's report of the proceeds but a beggarly account of empty boxes Early next morning we renewed our journey The burden of their conversation now was the expression of an anxiety to reach the circus without delay They hurried forward without again stopping to exhibit and in due course of time we reached New York taking lodgings at a house on the west side of the city in a street running from Broadway to the river I supposed my journey was at an end and expected in a day or two at least to return to my friends and family at Saratoga Brown and Hamilton however began to importune me to continue with them to Washington They alleged that immediately on their arrival now that the summer season was approaching the circus would set out for the north They promised me a situation and high wages if I would accompany them Largely did they expatiate on the advantages that would result to me and such were the flattering representations they made that I finally concluded to accept the offer The next morning they suggested that inasmuch as we were about entering a slave State it would be well before leaving New York to procure free papers The idea struck me as a prudent one though I think it would scarcely have occurred to me had they not proposed it We proceeded at once to what I understood to be the Custom House They made oath to certain facts showing I was a free man A paper was drawn up and handed us with the direction to take it to the clerk's office We did so and the clerk having added something to it for which he was paid six shillings we returned again to the Custom House Some further formalities were gone through with before it was completed when paying the officer two dollars I placed the papers in my pocket and started with my two friends to our hotel I thought at the time I must confess that the papers were scarcely worth the cost of obtaining them the apprehension of danger to my personal safety never having suggested itself to me in the remotest manner The clerk to whom we were directed I remember made a memorandum in a large book which I presume is in the office yet A reference to the entries during the latter part of March or first of April I have no doubt will satisfy the incredulous at least so far as this particular transaction is concerned With the evidence of freedom in my possession the next day after our arrival in New York we crossed the ferry to Jersey City and took the road to Philadelphia Here we remained one night continuing our journey towards Baltimore early in the morning In due time we arrived in the latter city and stopped at a hotel near the railroad depot either kept by a Mr Rathbone or known as the Rathbone House All the way from New York their anxiety to reach the circus seemed to grow more and more intense We left the carriage at Baltimore and entering the cars proceeded to Washington at which place we arrived just at nightfall the evening previous to the funeral of General Harrison and stopped at Gadsby's Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue After supper they called me to their apartments and paid me forty three dollars a sum greater than my wages amounted to Which act of generosity was in consequence they said of their not having exhibited as often as they had given me to anticipate during our trip from Saratoga They moreover informed me that it had been the intention of the circus company to leave Washington the next morning but that on account of the funeral they had concluded to remain another day They were then as they had been from the time of our first meeting extremely kind No opportunity was omitted of addressing me in the language of approbation while on the other hand I was certainly much prepossessed in their favor I gave them my confidence without reserve and would freely have trusted them to almost any extent Their constant conversation and manner towards me their foresight in suggesting the idea of free papers and a hundred other little acts unnecessary to be repeated all indicated that they were friends indeed sincerely solicitous for my welfare I know not but they were I know not but they were innocent of the great wickedness of which I now believe them guilty Whether they were accessory to my misfortunes subtle and inhuman monsters in the shape of men designedly luring me away from home and family and liberty for the sake of gold those these read these s will have the same means of determining as myself If they were innocent my sudden disappearance must have been unaccountable indeed but revolving in my mind all the attending circumstances I never yet could indulge towards them so charitable a supposition After receiving the money from them of which they appeared to have an abundance they advised me not to go into the streets that night inasmuch as I was unacquainted with the customs of the city Promising to remember their advice I left them together and soon after was shown by a colored servant to a sleeping room in the back part of the hotel on the ground floor I laid down to rest thinking of home and wife and children and the long distance that stretched between us until I fell asleep But no good angel of pity came to my bedside bidding me to fly no voice of mercy forewarned me in my dreams of the trials that were just at hand The next day there was a great ant in Washington The roar of cannon and the tolling of bells filled the air while many houses were shrouded with crape and the streets were black with people As the day advanced the procession made its appearance coming slowly through the Avenue carriage after carriage in long succession while thousands upon thousands followed on foot all moving to the sound of melancholy music They were bearing the dead body of Harrison to the grave From early in the morning I was constantly in the company of Hamilton and Brown They were the only persons I knew in Washington We stood together as the funeral pomp passed by I remember distinctly how the window glass would break and rattle to the ground after each report of the cannon they were firing in the burial ground We went to the Capitol and walked a long time about the grounds In the afternoon they strolled towards the President's House all the time keeping me near to them and pointing out various places of interest As yet I had seen nothing of the circus In fact I had thought of it but little if at all amidst the excitement of the day My friends several times during the afternoon entered drinking saloons and called for liquor They were by no means in the habit however so far as I knew them of indulging to excess On these occasions after serving themselves they would pour out a glass and hand it to me I did not become intoxicated as may be inferred from what subsequently occurred Towards evening and soon after partaking of one of these potations I began to experience most unpleasant sensations I felt extremely ill My head commenced aching a dull heavy pain inexpressibly disagreeable At the supper table I was without appetite the sight and flavor of food was nauseous About dark the same servant conducted me to the room I had occupied the previous night Brown and Hamilton advised me to retire commiserating me kindly and expressing hopes that I would be better in the morning Divesting myself of coat and boots merely I threw myself upon the bed It was impossible to sleep The pain in my head continued to increase until it became almost unbearable In a short time I became thirsty My lips were parched I could think of nothing but water of lakes and flowing rivers of brooks where I had stooped to drink and of the dripping bucket rising with its cool and overflowing nectar from the bottom of the well Towards midnight as near as I could judge I arose unable longer to bear such intensity of thirst I was a stranger in the house and knew nothing of its apartments There was no one up as I could observe Groping about at random I knew not where I found the way at last to a kitchen in the basement Two or three colored servants were moving through it one of whom a woman gave me two glasses of water It afforded momentary relief but by the time I had reached my room again the same burning desire of drink the same tormenting thirst had again returned It was even more torturing than before as was also the wild pain in my head if such a thing could be I was in sore distress in most excruciating agony I seemed to stand on the brink of madness The memory of that night of horrible suffering will follow me to the grave In the course of an hour or more after my return from the kitchen I was conscious of some one entering my room There seemed to be several a mingling of various voices but how many or who they were I cannot tell Whether Brown and Hamilton were among them is a mere matter of conjecture I only remember with any degree of distinctness that I was told it was necessary to go to a physician and procure medicine and that pulling on my boots without coat or hat I followed them through a long passage way or alley into the open street It ran out at right angles from Pennsylvania Avenue On the opposite side there was a light burning in a window My impression is there were then three persons with me but it is altogether indefinite and vague and like the memory of a painful dream Going towards the light which I imagined proceeded from a physician's office and which seemed to recede as I advanced is the last glimmering recollection I can now recall From that moment I was insensible How long I remained in that condition whether only that night or many days and nights I do not know but when consciousness returned I found myself alone in utter darkness and in chains The pain in my head had subsided in a measure but I was very faint and weak I was sitting upon a low bench made of rough boards and without coat or hat I was hand cuffed Around my ankles also were a pair of heavy fetters One end of a chain was fastened to a large ring in the floor the other to the fetters on my ankles I tried in vain to stand upon my feet Waking from such a painful trance it was some time before I could collect my thoughts Where was I What was the meaning of these chains Where were Brown and Hamilton What had I done to deserve imprisonment in such a dungeon I could not comprehend There was a blank of some indefinite period preceding my awakening in that lonely place the events of which the utmost stretch of memory was unable to recall I listened intently for some sign or sound of life but nothing broke the oppressive silence save the clinking of my chains whenever I chanced to move I spoke aloud but the sound of my voice startled me I felt of my pockets so far as the fetters would allow far enough indeed to ascertain that I had not only been robbed of liberty but that my money and free papers were also gone Then did the idea begin to break upon my mind at first dim and confused that I had been kidnapped But that I thought was incredible There must have been some misapprehension some unfortunate mistake It could not be that a free citizen of New York who had wronged no man nor violated any law should be dealt with thus inhumanly The more I contemplated my situation however the more I became confirmed in my suspicions It was a desolate thought indeed I felt there was no trust or mercy in unfeeling man and commending myself to the God of the oppressed bowed my head upon my fettered hands and wept most bitterly III PAINFUL MEDITATIONS JAMES H BURCH WILLIAMS' SLAVE PEN IN WASHINGTON THE LACKEY RADRURN ASSERT MY FREEDOM THE ANGER OF THE TRADER THE PADDLE AND CAT O' NINETAILS THE WHIPPING NEW ACQUAINTANCES RAY WILLIAMS AND RANDALL ARRIVAL OF LITTLE EMILY AND HER MOTHER IN THE PEN MATERNAL SORROWS THE STORY OF ELIZA SOME three hours elapsed during which time I remained seated on the low bench absorbed in painful meditations At length I heard the crowing of a cock and soon a distant rumbling sound as of carriages hurrying through the streets came to my ears and I knew that it was day No ray of light however penetrated my prison Finally I heard footsteps immediately overhead as of some one walking to and fro It occurred to me then that I must be in an underground apartment and the damp mouldy odors of the place confirmed the supposition The noise above continued for at least an hour when at last I heard footsteps approaching from without A key rattled in the lock a strong door swung back upon its hinges admitting a flood of light and two men entered and stood before me One of them was a large powerful man forty years of age perhaps with dark chestnut colored hair slightly interspersed with gray His face was full his complexion flush his features grossly coarse expressive of nothing but cruelty and cunning He was about five feet ten inches high of full habit and without prejudice I must be allowed to say was a man whose whole appearance was sinister and repugnant His name was James H Burch as I learned afterwards a well known slave dealer in Washington and then or lately connected in business as a partner with Theophilus Freeman of New Orleans The person who accompanied him was a simple lackey named Ebenezer Radburn who acted merely in the capacity of turnkey Both of these men still live in Washington or did at the time of my return through that city from slavery in January last The light admitted through the open door enabled me to observe the room in which I was confined It was about twelve feet square the walls of solid masonry The floor was of heavy plank There was one small window crossed with great iron bars with an outside shutter securely fastened An iron bound door led into an adjoining cell or vault wholly destitute of windows or any means of admitting light The furniture of the room in which I was consisted of the wooden bench on which I sat an old fashioned dirty box stove and besides these in either cell there was neither bed nor blanket nor any other thing whatever The door through which Burch and Radburn entered led through a small passage up a flight of steps into a yard surrounded by a brick wall ten or twelve feet high immediately in rear of a building of the same width as itself The yard extended rearward from the house about thirty feet In one part of the wall there was a strongly ironed door opening into a narrow covered passage leading along one side of the house into the street The doom of the colored man upon whom the door leading out of that narrow passage closed was sealed The top of the wall supported one end of a roof which ascended inwards forming a kind of open shed Underneath the roof there was a crazy loft all round where slaves if so disposed might sleep at night or in inclement weather seek shelter from the storm It was like a farmer's barnyard in most respects save it was so constructed that the outside world could never see the human cattle that were herded there The building to which the yard was attached was two stories high fronting on one of the public streets of Washington Its outside presented only the appearance of a quiet private residence A stranger looking at it would never have dreamed of its execrable uses Strange as it may seem within plain sight of this same house looking down from its commanding height upon it was the Capitol The voices of patriotic representatives boasting of freedom and equality and the rattling of the poor slave's chains almost commingled A slave pen within the very shadow of the Capitol Such is a correct description as it was in of Williams' slave pen in Washington in one of the cellars of which I found myself so unaccountably confined Well my boy how do you feel now said Burch as he entered through the open door I replied that I was sick and inquired the cause of my imprisonment He answered that I was his slave that he had bought me and that he was about to send me to New Orleans I asserted aloud and boldly that I was a freeman a resident of Saratoga where I had a wife and children who were also free and that my name was Northup I complained bitterly of the strange treatment I had received and threatened upon my liberation to have satisfaction for the wrong He denied that I was free and with an emphatic oath declared that I came from Georgia Again and again I asserted I was no man's slave and insisted upon his taking off my chains at once He endeavored to hush me as if he feared my voice would be overheard But I would not be silent and denounced the authors of my imprisonment whoever they might be as unmitigated villains Finding he could not quiet me he flew into a towering passion With blasphemous oaths he called me a black liar a runaway from Georgia and every other profane and vulgar epithet that the most indecent fancy could conceive During this time Radburn was standing silently by His business was to oversee this human or rather inhuman stable receiving slaves feeding and whipping them at the rate of two shillings a head per day Turning to him Burch ordered the paddle and cat o' ninetails to be brought in He disappeared and in a few moments returned with these instruments of torture The paddle as it is termed in slave beating parlance or at least the one with which I first became acquainted and of which I now speak was a piece of hard wood board eighteen or twenty inches long moulded to the shape of an old fashioned pudding stick or ordinary oar The flattened portion which was about the size in circumference of two open hands was bored with a small auger in numerous places The cat was a large rope of many strands the strands unraveled and a knot tied at the extremity of each As soon as these formidable whips appeared I was seized by both of them and roughly divested of my clothing My feet as has been stated were fastened to the floor Drawing me over the bench face downwards Radburn placed his heavy foot upon the fetters between my wrists holding them painfully to the floor With the paddle Burch commenced beating me Blow after blow was inflicted upon my naked body When his unrelenting arm grew tired he stopped and asked if I still insisted I was a free man I did insist upon it and then the blows were renewed faster and more energetically if possible than before When again tired he would repeat the same question and receiving the same answer continue his cruel labor All this time the incarnate devil was uttering most fiendish oaths At length the paddle broke leaving the useless handle in his hand Still I would not yield All his brutal blows could not force from my lips the foul lie that I was a slave Casting madly on the floor the handle of the broken paddle he seized the rope This was far more painful than the other I struggled with all my power but it was in vain I prayed for mercy but my prayer was only answered with imprecations and with stripes I thought I must die beneath the lashes of the accursed brute Even now the flesh crawls upon my bones as I recall the scene I was all on fire My sufferings I can compare to nothing else than the burning agonies of hell At last I became silent to his repeated questions I would make no reply In fact I was becoming almost unable to speak Still he plied the lash without stint upon my poor body until it seemed that the lacerated flesh was stripped from my bones at every stroke A man with a particle of mercy in his soul would not have beaten even a dog so cruelly At length Radburn said that it was useless to whip me any more that I would be sore enough Thereupon Burch desisted saying with an admonitory shake of his fist in my face and hissing the words through his firm set teeth that if ever I dared to utter again that I was entitled to my freedom that I had been kidnapped or any thing whatever of the kind the castigation I had just received was nothing in comparison with what would follow He swore that he would either conquer or kill me With these consolatory words the fetters were taken from my wrists my feet still remaining fastened to the ring the shutter of the little barred window which had been opened was again closed and going out locking the great door behind them I was left in darkness as before In an hour perhaps two my heart leaped to my throat as the key rattled in the door again I who had been so lonely and who had longed so ardently to see some one I cared not who now shuddered at the thought of man's approach A human face was fearful to me especially a white one Radburn entered bringing with him on a tin plate a piece of shriveled fried pork a slice of bread and a cup of water He asked me how I felt and remarked that I had received a pretty severe flogging He remonstrated with me against the propriety of asserting my freedom In rather a patronizing and confidential manner he gave it to me as his advice that the less I said on that subject the better it would be for me The man evidently endeavored to appear kind whether touched at the sight of my sad condition or with the view of silencing on my part any further expression of my rights it is not necessary now to conjecture He unlocked the festers from my ankles opened the shutters of the little window and departed leaving me again alone By this time I had become stiff and sore my body was covered with blisters and it was with great pain and difficulty that I could move From the window I could observe nothing but the roof resting on the adjacent wall At night I laid down upon the damp hard floor without any pillow or covering whatever Punctually twice a day Radburn came in with his pork and bread and water I had but little appetite though I was tormented with continual thirst My wounds would not permit me to remain but a few minutes in any one position so sitting or standing or moving slowly round I passed the days and nights I was heart sick and discouraged Thoughts of my family of my wife and children continually occupied my mind When sleep overpowered me I dreamed of them dreamed I was again in Saratoga that I could see their faces and hear their voices calling me Awakening from the pleasant phantasms of sleep to the bitter realities around me I could but groan and weep Still my spirit was not broken I indulged the anticipation of escape and that speedily It was impossible I reasoned that men could be so unjust as to detain me as a slave when the truth of my case was known Burch ascertaining I was no runaway from Georgia would certainly let me go Though suspicions of Brown and Hamilton were not unfrequent I could not reconcile myself to the idea that they were instrumental to my imprisonment Surely they would seek me out they would deliver me from thraldom Alas I had not then learned the measure of man's inhumanity to man nor to what limitless extent of wickedness he will go for the love of gain In the course of several days the outer door was thrown open allowing me the liberty of the yard There I found three slaves one of them a lad of ten years the others young men of about twenty and twenty five I was not long in forming an acquaintance and learning their names and the particulars of their history The eldest was a colored man named Clemens Ray He had lived in Washington had driven a hack and worked in a livery stable there for a long time He was very intelligent and fully comprehended his situation The thought of going south overwhelmed him with grief Burch had purchased him a few days before and had placed him there until such time as he was ready to send him to the New Orleans market From him I learned for the first time that I was in William's Slave Pen a place I had never heard of previously He described to me the uses for which it was designed I repeated to him the particulars of my unhappy story but he could only give me the consolation of his sympathy He also advised me to be silent henceforth on the subject of my freedom for knowing the character of Burch he assured me that it would only be attended with renewed whip ping The next eldest was named John Williams He was raised in Virginia not far from Washington Burch had taken him in payment of a debt and he constantly entertained the hope that his master would redeem him a hope that was subsequently realized The lad was a sprightly child that answered to the name of Randall Most of the time he was playing about the yard but occasionally would cry calling for his mother and wondering when she would come His mother's absence seemed to be the great and only grief in his little heart He was too young to realize his condition and when the memory of his mother was not in his mind he amused us with his pleasant pranks At night Ray Williams and the boy slept in the loft of the shed while I was locked in the cell Finally we were each provided with blankets such as are used upon horses the only bedding I was allowed to have for twelve years afterwards Ray and Williams asked me many questions about New York how colored people were treated there how they could have homes and families of their own with none to disturb and oppress them and Ray especially sighed continually for freedom Such conversations however were not in the hearing of Burch or the keeper Radburn Aspirations such as these would have brought down the lash upon our backs It is necessary in this narrative in order to present a full and truthful statement of all the principal events in the history of my life and to portray the institution of Slavery as I have seen and known it to speak of well known places and of many persons who are yet living I am and always was an entire stranger in Washington and its vicinity aside from Burch and Radburn knowing no man there except as I have heard of them through my enslaved companions What I am about to say if false can be easily contradicted I remained in Williams slave pen about two weeks The night previous to my departure a woman was brought in weeping bitterly and leading by the hand a little child They were Randall's mother and half sister On meeting them he was overjoyed clinging to her dress kissing the child and exhibiting every demonstration of delight The mother also clasped him in her arms embraced him tenderly and gazed at him fondly through her tears calling him by many an endearing name Emily the child was seven or eight years old of light complexion and with a face of admirable beauty Her hair fell in curls around her neck while the style and richness of her dress and the neatness of her whole appearance indicated she had been brought up in the midst of wealth She was a sweet child indeed The woman also was arrayed in silk with rings upon her fingers and golden ornaments suspended from her ears Her air and manners the correctness and propriety of her language all showed evidently that she had sometime stood above the common level of a slave She seemed to be amazed at finding herself in such a place as that It was plainly a sudden and unexpected turn of fortune that had brought her there Filling the air with her complaining she was hustled with the children and myself into the cell Language can convey but an inadequate impression of the lamentations to which she gave incessant utterance Throwing herself upon the floor and encircling the children in her arms she poured forth such touching words as only maternal love and kindness can suggest They nestled closely to her as if there only was there any safety or protection At last they slept their heads resting upon her lap While they slumbered she smoothed the hair back from their little foreheads and talked to them all night long She called them her darlings her sweet babes poor innocent things that knew not the misery they were destined to endure Soon they would have no mother to comfort them they would be taken from her What would become of them Oh she could not live away from her little Emmy and her dear boy They had always been good children and had such loving ways It would break her heart God knew she said if they were taken from her and yet she knew they meant to sell them and may be they would be separated and could never see each other any more It was enough to melt heart of stone to listen to the pitiful expressions of that desolate and distracted mother Her name was Eliza and this was the story of her life as she afterwards related it She was the slave of a rich man living in the neighborhood of Washington She was born I think she said on his plantation Years before he had fallen into dissipated habits and quarreled with his wife In fact soon after the birth of Randall they separated Leaving his wife and daughter in the house they had always occupied he erected a new one nearby on the estate Into this house he brought Eliza and on condition of her living with him she and her children were to be emancipated She resided with him there nine years with servants to attend upon her and provided with every comfort and luxury of life Emily was his child Finally her young mistress who had always remained with her mother at the homestead married a Mr Jacob Brooks At length for some cause as I gathered from her relation beyond Berry's control a division of his property was made She and her children fell to the share of Mr Brooks During the nine years she had lived with Berry in consequence of the position she was compelled to occupy she and Emily had become the object of Mrs Berry and her daughter's hatred and dislike Berry himself she represented as a man of naturally a kind heart who always promised her that she should have her freedom and who she had no doubt would arrant it to her then if it were only in his power As soon as they thus came into the possession and control of the daughter it became very manifest they would not live long together The sight of Eliza seemed to be odious to Mrs Brooks neither could she bear to look upon the child half sister and beautiful as she was The day she was led into the pen Brooks had brought her from the estate into the city under pretence that the time had come when her free papers were to be executed in fulfillment of her master's promise Elated at the prospect of immediate liberty she decked herself and little Emmy in their best apparel and accompanied him with a joyful heart On their arrival in the city instead of being baptized into the family of freemen she was delivered to the trader Burch The paper that was executed was a bill of sale The hope of years was blasted in a moment From the hight of most exulting happiness to the utmost depths of wretchedness she had that day descended No wonder that she wept and filled the pen with wailings and expressions of heart rending woe Eliza is now dead Far up the Red River where it pours its waters sluggishly through the unhealthy low lands of Louisiana she rests in the grave at last the only resting place of the poor slave How all her fears were realized how she mourned day and night and never would be comforted how as she predicted her heart did indeed break with the burden of maternal sorrow will be seen as the narrative proceeds IV ELIZA'S SORROWS PREPARATION TO EMBARK DRIVEN THROUGH THE STREET'S OF WASHINGTON HALL COLUMBIA THE TOMB OF WASHINGTON CLEM RAY THE BREAKFAST ON THE STEAMER THE HAPPY BIRDS AQUIA CREEK FREDERICKSBURG ARRIVAL IN RICHMOND GOODIN AND HIS SLAVE PEN ROBERT OF CINCINNATI DAVID AND HIS WIFE MARY AND LETHE CLEM'S RETURN HIS SUBSEQUENT ESCAPE TO CANADA THE BRIG ORLEANS JAMES H BURCH AT intervals during the first night of Eliza's incarceration in the pen she complained bitterly of Jacob Brook's her young mistress' husband She declared that had she been aware of the deception he intended to practice upon her he never would have brought her there alive They had chosen the opportunity of getting her away when Master Berry was absent from the plantation He had always been kind to her She wished that she could see him but she knew that even he was unable now to rescue her Then would she commence weeping again kissing the sleeping children talking first to one then to the other as they lay in their unconscious slumbers with their heads upon her lap So wore the long night away and when the morning dawned and night had come again still she kept mourning on and would not be consoled About midnight following the cell door opened and Burch and Radburn entered with lanterns in their hands Burch with an oath ordered us to roll up our blankets without delay and get ready to go on board tile boat He swore we would be left unless we hurried fast He aroused the children from their slumbers with a rough shake and said they were d d sleepy it appeared Going out into the yard he called Clem Ray ordering him to leave the loft and come into the cell and bring his blanket with him When Clem appeared he placed us side by side and fastened us together with hand cuffs my left hand to his right John Williams had been taken out a day or two before his master having redeemed him greatly to his delight Clem and I were ordered to march Eliza and the children following We were conducted into the yard from thence into the covered passage and up a flight of steps through a side door into the upper room where I had heard the walking to and fro Its furniture was a stove a few old chairs and a long table covered with papers It was a white washed room without any carpet on the floor and seemed a sort of office By one of the windows I remember hung a rusty sword which attracted my attention Burch's trunk was there In obedience to his orders I took hold of one of its handles with my unfettered hand while he taking hold of the other we proceeded out of the front door into the street in the same order as we had left the cell It was a dark night All was quiet I could see lights or the reflection of them over towards Pennsylvania Avenue but there was no one not even a straggler to be seen I was almost resolved to attempt to break away Had I not been hand cuffed the attempt would certainly have been made whatever consequence might have followed Radburn was in the rear carrying a large stick and hurrying up the children as fast as the little ones could walk So we passed hand cuffed and in silence through the streets of Washington through the Capital of a nation whose theory of government we are told rests on the foundation of man's inalienable right to life LIBERTY and the pursuit of happiness Hail Columbia happy land indeed Reaching the steamboat we were quickly hustled into the hold among barrels and boxes of freight A colored servant brought a light the bell rung and soon the vessel started down the Potomac carrying us we knew not where The bell tolled as we passed the tomb of Washington Burch no doubt with uncovered head bowed reverently before the sacred ashes of the man who devoted his illustrious life to the liberty of his country None of us slept that night but Randall and little Emmy For the first time Clem Ray was wholly overcome To him the idea of going south was terrible in the extreme He was leaving the friends and associations of his youth every thing that was dear and precious to his heart in all probability never to return He and Eliza mingled their tears together bemoaning their cruel fate For my own part difficult as it was I endeavored to keep up my spirits I resolved in my mind a hundred plans of escape and fully determined to make the attempt the first desperate chance that offered I had by this time become satisfied however that my true policy was to say nothing further on the subject of my having been born a freeman It would but expose me to mal treatment and diminish the chances of liberation After sunrise in the morning we were called up on deck to breakfast Burch took our hand cuffs off and we sat down to table He asked Eliza if she would take a dram She declined thanking him politely During the meal we were all silent not a word passed between us A mulatto woman who served at table seemed to take an interest in our behalf told us to cheer up and not to be so cast down Breakfast over the hand cuffs were restored and Burch ordered us out on the stern deck We sat down together on some boxes still saying nothing in Burch's presence Occasionally a passenger would walk out to where we were look at us for a while then silently return It was a very pleasant morning The fields along the river were covered with verdure far in advance of what I had been accustomed to see at that season of the year The sun shone out warmly the birds were singing in the trees The happy birds I envied them I wished for wings like them that I might cleave the air to where my birdlings waited vainly for their father's coming in the cooler region of the North In the forenoon the steamer reached Aquia Creek There the passengers took stages Burch and his five slaves occupying one exclusively He laughed with the children and at one stopping place went so far as to purchase them a piece of gingerbread He told me to hold up my head and look smart That I might perhaps get a good master if I behaved myself I made him no reply His face was hateful to me and I could not bear to look upon it I sat in the corner cherishing in my heart the hope not yet extinct of some day meeting the tyrant on the soil of my native State At Fredericksburgh we were transferred from the stage coach to a car and before dark arrived in Richmond the chief city of Virginia At this city we were taken from the cars and driven through the street to a slave pen between the railroad depot and the river kept by a Mr Goodin This pen is similar to Williams' in Washington except it is somewhat larger and besides there were two small houses standing at opposite corners within the yard These houses are susually found within slave yards being used as rooms for the examination of human chattels by purchasers before concluding a bargain Unsoundness in a slave as well as in a horse detracts materially from his value If no warranty is given a close examination is a matter of particular importance to the negro jockey We were met at the door of Goodin's yard by that gentleman himself a short fat man with a round plump face black hair and whiskers and a complexion almost as dark as some of his own negroes He had a hard stern look and was perhaps about fifty years of age Burch and he met with great cordiality They were evidently old friends Shaking each other warmly by the hand Burch remarked he had brought some company inquired at what time the brig would leave and was answered that it would probably leave the next day at such an hour Goodin then turned to me took hold of my arm turned me partly round looked at me sharply with the air of one who considered himself a good judge of property and as if estimating in his own mind about how much I was worth Well boy where did you come from Forgetting myself for a moment I answered From New York New York H l what have you been doing up there was his astonished interrogatory Observing Burch at this moment looking at me with an angry expression that conveyed a meaning it was not difficult to understand I immediately said O I have only been up that way a piece in a manner intended to imply that although I might have been as far as New York yet I wished it distinctly understood that I did not belong to that free State nor to any other Goodin then turned to Clem and then to Eliza and the children examining them severally and asking various questions He was pleased with Emily as was every one who saw the child's sweet countenance She was not as tidy as when I first beheld her her hair was now somewhat disheveled but through its unkempt and soft profusion there still beamed a little face of most surpassing loveliness Altogether we were a fair lot a devilish good lot he said enforcing that opinion with more than one emphatic adjective not found in the Christian vocabulary Thereupon we passed into the yard Quite a number of slaves as many as thirty I should say were moving about or sitting on benches under the shed They were all cleanly dressed the men with hats the women with handkerchiefs tied about their heads Burch and Goodin after separating from us walked up the steps at the back part of the main building and sat down upon the door sill They entered into conversation but the subject of it I could not hear Presently Burch came down into the yard unfettered me and led me into one of the small houses You told that man you came from New York said he I replied I told him I had been up as far as New York to be sure but did not tell him I belonged there nor that I was a freeman I meant no harm at all Master Burch I would not have said it had I thought He looked at me a moment as if he was ready to devour me then turning round went out In a few minutes he returned If ever I hear you say a word about New York or about your freedom I will be the death of you I will kill you you may rely on that he ejaculated fiercely I doubt not he understood then better than I did the danger and the penalty of selling a free man into slavery He felt the necessity of closing my mouth against the crime he knew he was committing Of course my life would not have weighed a feather in any emergency requiring such a sacrifice Undoubtedly he meant precisely what he said Under the shed on one side of the yard there was constructed a rough table while overhead were sleeping lofts the same as in the pen at Washington After partaking at this table of our supper of pork and bread I was hand cuffed to a large yellow man quite stout and fleshy with a countenance expressive of the utmost melancholy He was a man of intelligence and information Chained together it was not long before we became acquainted with each other's history His name was Robert Like myself he had been born free and had a wife and two children in Cincinnati He said he had come south with two men who had hired him in the city of his residence Without free papers he had been seized at Fredericksburgh placed in confinement and beaten until he had learned as I had the necessity and the policy of silence He had been in Goodin's pen about three weeks To this man I became much attached We could sympathize with and understand each other It was with tears and a heavy heart not many days subsequently that I saw him die and looked for the last time upon his lifeless form Robert and myself with Clem Eliza and her children slept that night upon our blankets in one of the small houses in the yard There were four others all from the same plantation who had been sold and were now on their way south who also occupied it with us David and his wife Caroline both mulattos were exceedingly affected They dreaded the thought of being put into the cane and cotton fields but their greatest source of anxiety was the apprehension of being separated Mary a tall lithe girl of a most jetty black was listless and apparently indifferent Like many of the class she scarcely knew there was such a word as freedom Brought up in the ignorance of a brute she possessed but little more than a brute's intelligence She was one of those and there are very many who fear nothing but their master's lash and know no further duty than to obey his voice The other was Lethe She was of an entirely different character She had long straight hair and bore more the appearance of an Indian than a negro woman She had sharp and spiteful eyes and continually gave utterance to the language of hatred and revenge Her husband had been sold She knew not where she was An exchange of masters she was sure could not be for the worse She cared not whither they might carry her Pointing to the scars upon her face the desperate creature wished that she might see the day when she could wipe them off in some man's blood While we were thus learning the history of each other's wretchedness Eliza was seated in a corner by herself singing hymns and praying for her children Wearied from the loss of so much sleep I could no longer bear up against the advances of that sweet restorer and laying down by the side of Robert on the floor soon forgot my troubles and slept until the dawn of day In the morning having swept the yard and washed ourselves under Goodin's superintendence we were ordered to roll up our blankets and make ready for the continuance of our journey Clem Ray was informed that he would go no further Burch for some cause having concluded to carry him back to Washington He was much rejoiced Shaking hands we parted in the slave pen at Richmond and I have not seen him since But much to my surprise since my return I learned that he had escaped from bondage and on his way to the free soil of Canada lodged one night at the house of my brother in law in Saratoga informing my family of the place and the condition in which he left me In the afternoon we were drawn up two abreast Robert and myself in advance and in this order driven by Burch and Goodin from the yard through the streets of Richmond to the brig Orleans She was a vessel of respectable size full rigged and freighted principally with tobacco We were all on board by five o'clock Burch brought us each a tin cup and a spoon There were forty of us in the brig being all except Clem that were in the pen With a small pocket knife that had not been taken from me I began cutting the initials of my name upon the tin cup The others immediately flocked round me requesting me to mark theirs in a similar manner In time I gratified them all of which they did not appear to be forgetful We were all stowed away in the hold at night and the hatch barred down We laid on boxes or where ever there was room enough to stretch our blankets on the floor Burch accompanied us no farther than Richmond returning from that point to the capital with Clem Not until the lapse of almost twelve years to wit in January last in the Washington police office did I set my eyes upon his face again James H Burch was a slave trader buying men women and children at low prices and selling them at an advance He was a speculator in human flesh a disreputable calling and so considered at the South For the present he disappears from the scenes recorded in this narrative but he will appear again before its close not in the character of a man whipping tyrant but as an arrested cringing criminal in a court of law that failed to do him justice V ARRIVAL AT NORFOLK FREDERICK AND MARIA ARTHUR THE FREEMAN APPOINTED STEWARD JIM CUFFEE AND JENNY THE STORM BAHAMA BANKS THE CALM THE CONSPIRACY THE LONG BOAT THE SMALL POX DEATH OF ROBERT MANNING THE SAILOR THE MEETING IN THE FORECASTLE THE LETTER ARRIVAL AT NEW ORLEANS ARTHUR'S RESCUE THEOPHILUS FREEMAN THE CONSIGNEE PLATT FIRST NIGHT IN THE NEW ORLEANS SLAVE PEN AFTER we were all on board the brig Orleans proceeded down James River Passing into Chesapeake Bay we arrived next day opposite the city of Norfolk While lying at anchor a lighter approached us from the town bringing four more slaves Frederick a boy of eighteen had been born a slave as also had Henry who was some years older They had both been house servants in the city Maria was a rather genteel looting colored girl with a faultless form but ignorant and extremely vain The idea of going to New Orleans was pleasing to her She entertained an extravagantly high opinion of her own attractions Assuming a haughty mien she declared to her companions that immediately on our arrival in New Orleans she had no doubt some wealthy single gentleman of good taste would purchase her at once But the most prominent of the four was as a man named Arthur As the lighter approached he struggled stoutly with his keepers It was with main force that he was dragged aboard the brig He protested in a loud voice against the treatment he was receiving and demanded to be released His face was swollen and covered with wounds and bruises and indeed one side of it was a complete raw sore He was forced with all haste down the hatchway into the hold I caught an outline of his story as he was borne struggling along of which he afterwards gave me a more full relation and it was as follows He had long resided in the city of Norfolk and was a free man He had a family living there and was a mason by trade Having been unusually detained he was returning late one night to his house in the suburbs of the city when he was attacked by a gang of persons in an unfrequented street He fought until his strength failed him Overpowered at last he was gagged and bound with ropes and beaten until he became insensible For several days they secreted him in the slave pen at Norfolk a very common establishment it appears in the cities of the South The night before he had been taken out and put on board the lighter which pushing out from shore had awaited our arrival For some time he continued his protestations and was altogether irreconcilable At length however he became silent He sank into a gloomy and thoughtful mood and appeared to be counseling with himself There was in the man's determined face something that suggested the thought of desperation After leaving Norfolk the hand cuffs were taken off and during the day we were allowed to remain on deck The captain selected Robert as his waiter and I was appointed to superintend the cooking department and the distribution of food and water I had three assistants Jim Cuffee and Jenny Jenny's business was to prepare the coffee which consisted of corn meal scorched in a kettle boiled and sweetened with molasses Jim and Cuffee baked the hoe cake and boiled the bacon Standing by a table formed of a wide board resting on the heads of the barrels I cut and handed to each a slice of meat and a dodger of the bread and from Jenny's kettle also dipped out for each a cup of the coffee The use of plates was dispensed with and their sable fingers took the place of knives and forks Jim and Cuffee were very demure and attentive to business somewhat inflated with their situation as second cooks and without doubt feeling that there was a great responsibility resting on them I was called steward a name given me by the captain The slaves were fed twice a day at ten and five o'clock always receiving the same kind and quantity of fare and in the same manner as above described At night we were driven into the hold and securely fastened down Scarcely were we out of sight of land before we were overtaken by a violent storm The brig rolled and plunged until we feared she would go down Some were sea sick others on their knees praying while some were fast holding to each other paralyzed with fear The sea sickness rendered the place of our confinement loathsome and disgusting It would have been a happy thing for most of us it would have saved the agony of many hundred lashes and miserable deaths at last had the compassionate sea snatched us that day from the clutches of remorseless men The thought of Randall and little Emmy sinking down among the monsters of the deep is a more pleasant contemplation than to think of them as they are now perhaps dragging out lives of unrequited toil When in sight of the Bahama Banks at a place called Old Point Compass or the Hole in the Wall we were becalmed three days There was scarcely a breath of air The waters of the gulf presented a singularly white appearance like lime water In the order of events I come now to the relation of an occurrence which I never call to mind but with sensations of regret I thank God who has since permitted me to escape from the thralldom of slavery that through his merciful interposition I was prevented from imbruing my hands in the blood of his creatures Let not those who have never been placed in like circumstances judge me harshly Until they have been chained and beaten until they find themselves in the situation I was borne away from home and family towards a land of bondage let them refrain from saying what they would not do for liberty How far I should have been justified in the sight of God and man it is unnecessary now to speculate upon It is enough to say that I am able to congratulate myself upon the harmless termination of an affair which threatened for a time to be attended with serious results Towards evening on the first day of the calm Arthur and myself were in the bow of the vessel seated on the windlass We were conversing together of the probable destiny that awaited us and mourning together over our misfortunes Arthur said and I agreed with him that death was far less terrible than the living prospect that was before us For a long time we talked of our children our past lives and of the probabilities of escape Obtaining possession of the brig was suggested by one of us We discussed the possibility of our being able in such an event to make our way to the harbor of New York I knew little of the compass but the idea of risking the experiment was eagerly entertained The chances for and against us in an encounter with the crew was canvassed Who could be relied upon and who could not the proper time and manner of the attack were all talked over and over again From the moment the plot suggested itself I began to hope I revolved it constantly in my mind As difficulty after difficulty arose some ready conceit was at hand demonstrating how it could be overcome While others slept Arthur and I were maturing our plans At length with much caution Robert was gradually made acquainted with our intentions He approved of them at once and entered into the conspiracy with a zealous spirit There was not another slave we dared to trust Brought up in fear and ignorance as they are it can scarcely be conceived how servilely they will cringe before a white man's look It was not safe to deposit so bold a secret with any of them and finally we three resolved to take upon ourselves alone the fearful responsibility of the attempt At night as has been said we were driven into the hold and the hatch barred down How to reach the deck was the first difficulty that presented itself On the bow of the brig however I had observed the small boat lying bottom upwards It occurred to me that by secreting ourselves underneath it we would not be missed from the crowd as they were hurried down into the hold at night I was selected to make the experiment in order to satisfy ourselves of its feasibility The next evening accordingly after supper watching my opportunity I hastily concealed myself beneath it Lying close upon the deck I could see what was going on around me while wholly unperceived myself In the morning as they came up I slipped from my hiding place without being observed The result was entirely satisfactory The captain and mate slept in the cabin of the former From Robert who had frequent occasion in his capacity of waiter to make observations in that quarter we ascertained the exact position of their respective berths He further informed us that there were always two pistols and a cutlass lying on the table The crew's cook slept in the cook galley on deck a sort of vehicle on wheels that could be moved about as convenience required while the sailors numbering only six either slept in the forecastle or in hammocks swung among the rigging Finally our arrangements were all completed Arthur and I were to steal silently to the captain's cabin seize the pistols and cutlass and as quickly as possible despatch him and the mate Robert with a club was to stand by the door leading from the deck down into the cabin and in case of necessity beat back the sailors until we could hurry to his assistance We were to proceed then as circumstances might require Should the attack be so sudden and successful as to prevent resistance the hatch was to remain barred down otherwise the slaves were to be called up and in the crowd d and hurry and confusion of the time we resolved to regain our liberty or lose our lives I was then to assume the unaccustomed place of pilot and steering northward we trusted that some lucky wind might bear us to the soil of freedom The mate's name was Biddee the captain's I cannot now recall though I rarely ever forget a name once heard The captain was a small genteel man erect and prompt with a proud bearing and looked the personification of courage If he is still living and these s should chance to meet his eye he will learn a fact connected with the voyage of the brig from Richmond to New Orleans in not entered on his log book We were all prepared and impatiently waiting an opportunity of putting our designs into execution when they were frustrated by a sad and unforeseen event Robert was taken ill It was soon announced that he had the small pox He continued to grow worse and four days previous to our arrival in New Orleans he died One of the sailors sewed him in his blanket with a large stone from the ballast at his feet and then laying him on a hatchway and elevating it with tackles above the railing the inanimate body of poor Robert was consigned to the white waters of the gulf We were all panic stricken by the appearance of the small pox The captain ordered lime to be scattered through the hold and other prudent precautions to be taken The death of Robert however and the presence of the malady oppressed me sadly and I gazed out over the great waste of waters with a spirit that was indeed disconsolate An evening or two after Robert's burial I was leaning on the hatchway near the forecastle full of desponding thoughts when a sailor in a kind voice asked me why I was so down hearted The tone and manner of the man assured me and I answered because I was a freeman and had been kidnapped He remarked that it was enough to make any one down hearted and continued to interrogate me until he learned the particulars of my whole history He was evidently much interested in my behalf and in the blunt speech of a sailor swore he would aid me all he could if it split his timbers I requested him to furnish me pen ink and paper in order that I might write to some of my friends He promised to obtain them but how I could use them undiscovered was a difficulty If I could only get into the forecastle while his watch was off and the other sailors asleep the thing could be accomplished The small boat instantly occurred to me He thought we were not far from the Balize at the mouth of the Mississippi and it was necessary that the letter be written soon or the opportunity would be lost Accordingly by arrangement I managed the next night to secret myself again under the long boat His watch was off at twelve I saw him pass into the forecastle and in about an hour followed him He was nodding over a table half asleep on which a sickly light was flickering and on which also was a pen and sheet of paper As I entered he aroused beckoned me to a seat beside him and pointed to the paper I directed the letter to Henry B Northup of Sandy Hill stating that I had been kidnapped was then on board the brig Orleans bound for New Orleans that it was then impossible for me to conjecture my ultimate destination and requesting he would take measures to rescue me The letter was sealed and directed and Manning having read it promised to deposit it in the New Orleans post office I hastened back to my place under the long boat and in the morning as the slaves came up and were walking round crept out unnoticed and mingled with them My good friend whose name was John Manning was an Englishman by birth and a noble hearted generous sailor as ever walked a deck He had lived in Boston was a tall well built man about twenty four years old with a face somewhat pock marked but full of benevolent expression Nothing to vary the monotony of our daily life occurred until we reached New Orleans On coming to the levee and before the vessel was made fast I saw Manning leap on shore and hurry away into the city As he started off he looked back over his shoulder significantly giving me to understand the object of his errand Presently he returned and passing close by me hunched me with his elbow with a peculiar wink as much as to say it is all right The letter as I have since learned reached Sandy Hill Mr Northup visited Albany and laid it before Governor Seward but inasmuch as it gave no definite information as to my probable locality it was not at that time deemed advisable to institute measures for my liberation It was concluded to delay trusting that a knowledge of where I was might eventually be obtained A happy and touching scene was witnessed immediately upon our reaching the levee Just as Manning left the brig on his way to the post office two men came up and called aloud for Arthur The latter as he recognized them was almost crazy with delight He could hardly be restrained from leaping over the brig's side and when they met soon after he grasped them by the hand and clung to them a long long time They were men from Norfolk who had come on to New Orleans to rescue him His kidnappers they informed him had been arrested and were then confined in the Norfolk prison They conversed a few moments with the captain and then departed with the rejoicing Arthur But in all the crowd that thronged the wharf there was no one who knew or cared for me Not one No familiar voice greeted my ears nor was there a single face that I had ever seen Soon Arthur would rejoin his family and have the satisfaction of seeing his wrongs avenged my family alas should I ever see them more There was a feeling of utter desolation in my heart filling it with a despairing and regretful sense that I had not gone down with Robert to the bottom of the sea Very soon traders and consignees came on board One a tall thin faced man with light complexion and a little bent made his appearance with a paper in his hand Burch's gang consisting of myself Eliza and her children Harry Lethe and some others who had joined us at Richmond were consigned to him This gentleman was Mr Theophilus Freeman Reading from his paper he called Platt No one answered The name was called again and again but still there was no reply Then Lethe was called then Eliza then Harry until the list was finished each one stepping forward as his or her name was called Captain where's Platt demanded Theophilus Freeman The captain was unable to inform him no one being on board answering to that name Who shipped that nigger he again inquired of the captain pointing to me Burch replied the captain Your name is Platt you answer my description Why don't you come forward he demanded of me in an angry tone I informed him that was not my name that I had never been called by it but that I had no objection to it as I knew of Well I will learn you your name said he and so you won't forget it either by he added Mr Theophilus Freeman by the way was not a whit behind his partner Burch in the matter of blasphemy On the vessel I had gone by the name of Steward and this was the first time I had ever been designated as Platt the name forwarded by Burch to his consignee From the vessel I observed the chain gang at work on the levee We passed near them as we were driven to Freeman's slave pen This pen is very similar to Goodin's in Richmond except the yard was enclosed by plank standing upright with ends sharpened instead of brick walls Including us there were now at least fifty in this pen Depositing our blankets in one of the small buildings in the yard and having been called up and fed we were allowed to saunter about the enclosure until night when we wrapped our blankets round us and laid down under the shed or in the loft or in the open yard just as each one preferred It was but a short time I closed my eyes that night Thought was busy in my brain Could it be possible that I was thousands of miles from home that I had been driven through the streets like a dumb beast that I had been chained and beaten without mercy that I was even then herded with a drove of slaves a slave myself Were the events of the last few weeks realities indeed or was I passing only through the dismal phases of a long protracted dream It was no illusion My cup of sorrow was full to overflowing Then I lifted up my hands to God and in the still watches of the night surrounded by the sleeping forms of my companions begged for mercy on the poor forsaken captive To the Almighty Father of us all the freeman and the slave I poured forth the supplications of a broken spirit imploring strength from on high to bear up against the burden of my troubles until the morning light aroused the slumberers ushering in another day of bondage VI FREEMAN'S INDUSTRY CLEANLINESS AND CLOTHES EXERCISING IN THE SHOW ROOM THE DANCE BOB THE FIDDLER ARRIVAL OF CUSTOMERS SLAVES EXAMINED THE OLD GENTLEMAN OF NEW ORLEANS SALE OF DAVID CAROLINE AND LETHE PARTING OF RANDALL AND ELIZA SMALL POX THE HOSPITAL RECOVERY AND RETURN TO FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN THE PURCHASER OF ELIZA HARRY AND PLATT ELIZA'S AGONY ON PARTING FROM LITTLE EMILY The very amiable pious hearted Mr Theophilus Freeman partner or consignee of James H Burch and keeper of the slave pen in New Orleans was out among his animals early in the morning With an occasional kick of the older men and women and many a sharp crack of the whip about the ears of the younger slaves it was not long before they were all astir and wide awake Mr Theophilus Freeman bustled about in a very industrious manner getting his property ready for the sales room intending no doubt to do that day a rousing business In the first place we were required to wash thoroughly and those with beards to shave We were then furnished with a new suit each cheap but clean The men had hat coat shirt pants and shoes the women frocks of calico and handkerchiefs to bind about their heads We were now conducted into a large room in the front part of the building to which the yard was attached in order to be properly trained before the admission of customers The men were arranged on one side of the room the women on the other The tallest was placed at the head of the row then the next tallest and so on in the order of their respective heights Emily was at the foot of the line of women Freeman charged us to remember our places exhorted us to appear smart and lively sometimes threatening and again holding out various inducements During the day he exercised us in the art of looking smart and of moving to our places with exact precision After being fed in the afternoon we were again paraded and made to dance Bob a colored boy who had some time belonged to Freeman played on the violin Standing near him I made bold to inquire if he could play the Virginia Reel He answered he could not and asked me if I could play Replying in the affirmative he handed me the violin I struck up a tune and finished it Freeman ordered me to continue playing and seemed well pleased telling Bob that I far excelled him a remark that seemed to grieve my musical companion very much Next day many customers called to examine Freeman's new lot The latter gentleman was very loquacious dwelling at much length upon our several good points and qualities He would make us hold up our heads walk briskly back and forth while customers would feel of our hands and arms and bodies turn us about ask us what we could do make us open our mouths and show our teeth precisely as a jockey examines a horse which he is about to barter for or purchase Sometimes a man or woman was taken back to the small house in the yard stripped and inspected more minutely Scars upon a slave's back were considered evidence of a rebellious or unruly spirit and hurt his sale One old gentleman who said he wanted a coachman appeared to take a fancy to me From his conversation with Burch I learned he was a resident in the city I very much desired that he would buy me because I conceived it would not be difficult to make my escape from New Orleans on some northern vessel Freeman asked him fifteen hundred dollars for me The old gentleman insisted it was too much as times were very hard Freeman however declared that I was sound and healthy of a good constitution and intelligent He made it a point to enlarge upon my musical attainments The old gentleman argued quite adroitly that there was nothing extraordinary about the nigger and finally to my regret went out saying he would call again During the day however a number of sales were made David and Caroline were purchased together by a Natchez planter They left us grinning broadly and in the most happy state of mind caused by the fact of their not being separated Lethe was sold to a planter of Baton Rouge her eyes flashing with anger as she was led away The same man also purchased Randall The little fellow was made to jump and run across the floor and perform many other feats exhibiting his activity and condition All the time the trade was going on Eliza was crying aloud and wringing her hands She besought the man not to buy him unless he also bought her self and Emily She promised in that case to be the most faithful slave that ever lived The man answered that he could not afford it and then Eliza burst into a paroxysm of grief weeping plaintively Freeman turned round to her savagely with his whip in his uplifted hand ordering her to stop her noise or he would flog her He would not have such work such snivelling and unless she ceased that minute he would take her to the yard and give her a hundred lashes Yes he would take the nonsense out of her pretty quick if he didn't might he be d d Eliza shrunk before him and tried to wipe away her tears but it was all in vain She wanted to be with her children she said the little time she had to live All the frowns and threats of Freeman could not wholly silence the afflicted mother She kept on begging and beseeching them most piteously not to separate the three Over and over again she told them how she loved her boy A great many times she repeated her former promises how very faithful and obedient she would be how hard she would labor day and night to the last moment of her life if he would only buy them all together But it was of no avail the man could not afford it The bargain was agreed upon and Randall must go alone Then Eliza ran to him embraced him passionately kissed him again and again told him to remember her all the while her tears falling in the boy's face like rain Freeman damned her calling her a blubbering bawling wench and ordered her to go to her place and behave herself and be somebody He swore he wouldn't stand such stuff but a little longer He would soon give her something to cry about if she was not mighty careful and that she might depend upon The planter from Baton Rouge with his new purchases was ready to depart Don't cry mama I will be a good boy Don't cry said Randall looking back as they passed out of the door What has become of the lad God knows It was a mournful scene indeed I would have cried myself if I had dared That night nearly all who came in on the brig Orleans were taken ill They complained of violent pain in the head and back Little Emily a thing unusual with her cried constantly In the morning a physician was called in but was unable to determine the nature of our complaint While examining me and asking questions touching my symptoms I gave it as my opinion that it was an attack of smallpox mentioning the fact of Robert's death as the reason of my belief It might be so indeed he thought and he would send for the head physician of the hospital Shortly the head physician came a small light haired man whom they called Dr Carr He pronounced it small pox whereupon there was much alarm throughout the yard Soon after Dr Carr left Eliza Emmy Harry and myself were put into a hack and driven to the hospital a large white marble building standing on the outskirts of the city Harry and I were placed in a room in one of the upper stories I became very sick For three days I was entirely blind While lying in this state one day Bob came in saying to Dr Carr that Freeman had sent him over to inquire how we were getting on Tell him said the doctor that Platt is very bad but that if he survives until nine o'clock he may recover I expected to die Though there was little in the prospect before me worth living for the near approach of death appalled me I thought I could have been resigned to yield up my life in the bosom of my family but to expire in the midst of strangers under such circumstances was a bitter reflection There were a great number in the hospital of both sexes and of all ages In the rear of the building coffins were manufactured When one died the bell tolled a signal to the undertaker to come and bear away the body to the potter's field Many times each day and night the tolling bell sent forth its melancholy voice announcing another death But my time had not yet come The crisis having passed I began to revive and at the end of two weeks and two days returned with Harry to the pen bearing upon my face the effects of the malady which to this day continues to disfigure it Eliza and Emily were also brought back next day in a hack and again were we paraded in the sales room for the inspection and examination of purchasers I still indulged the hope that the old gentleman in search of a coachman would call again as he had promised and purchase me In that event I felt an abiding confidence that I would soon regain my liberty Customer after customer entered but the old gentleman never made his appearance At length one day while we were in the yard Freeman came out and ordered us to our places in the great room A gentleman was waiting for us as we entered and inasmuch as he will be often mentioned in the progress of this narrative a description of his personal appearance and my estimation of his character at first sight may not be out of place He was a man above the ordinary height somewhat bent and stooping forward He was a good looking man and appeared to have reached about the middle age of life There was nothing repulsive in his presence but on the other hand there was something cheerful and attractive in his face and in his tone of voice The finer elements were all kindly mingled in his breast as any one could see He moved about among us asking many questions as to what we could do and what labor we had been accustomed to if we thought we would like to live with him and would be good boys if he would buy us and other interrogatories of like character After some further inspection and conversation touching prices he finally offered Freeman one thousand dollars for me nine hundred for Harry and seven hundred for Eliza Whether the small pox had depreciated our value or from what cause Freeman had concluded to fall five hundred dollars from the price I was before held at I cannot say At any rate after a little shrewd reflection he announced his acceptance of the offer As soon as Eliza heard it she was in an agony again By this time she had become haggard and hollow eyed with sickness and with sorrow It would be a relief if I could consistently pass over in silence the scene that now ensued It recalls memories more mournful and affecting than any language can portray I have seen mothers kissing for the last time the faces of their dead offspring I have seen them looking down into the grave as the earth fell with a dull sound upon their coffins hiding them from their eyes forever but never have I seen such an exhibition of intense unmeasured and unbounded grief as when Eliza was parted from her child She broke from her place in the line of women and rushing down where Emily was standing caught her in her arms The child sensible of some impending danger instinctively fastened her hands around her mother's neck and nestled her little head upon her bosom Freeman sternly ordered her to be quiet but she did not heed him He caught her by the arm and pulled her rudely but she only clung the closer to the child Then with a volley of great oaths he struck her such a heartless blow that she staggered backward and was like to fall Oh how piteously then did she beseech and beg and pray that they might not be separated Why could they not be purchased together Why not let her have one of her dear children Mercy mercy master she cried falling on her knees Please master buy Emily I can never work any if she is taken from me I will die Freeman interfered again but disregarding him she still plead most earnestly telling how Randall had been taken from her how she never him see him again and now it was too bad oh God it was too bad too cruel to take her away from Emily her pride her only darling that could not live it was so young without its mother Finally after much more of supplication the purchaser of Eliza stepped forward evidently affected and said to Freeman he would buy Emily and asked him what her price was What is her price Buy her was the responsive interrogatory of Theophilus Freeman And instantly answering his own inquiry he added I won't sell her She's not for sale The man remarked he was not in need of one so young that it would be of no profit to him but since the mother was so fond of her rather than see them separated he would pay a reasonable price But to this humane proposal Freeman was entirely deaf He would not sell her then on any account whatever There were heaps and piles of money to be made of her he said when she was a few years older There were men enough in New Orleans who would give five thousand dollars for such an extra handsome fancy piece as Emily would be rather than not get her No no he would not sell her then She was a beauty a picture a doll one of the regular bloods none of your thick lipped bullet headed cotton picking niggers if she was might he be d d When Eliza heard Freeman's determination not to part with Emily she became absolutely frantic I will not go without her They shall not take her from me she fairly shrieked her shrieks commingling with the loud and angry voice of Freeman commanding her to be silent Meantime Harry and myself had been to the yard and returned with our blankets and were at the front door ready to leave Our purchaser stood near us gazing at Eliza with an expression indicative of regret at having bought her at the expense of so much sorrow We waited some time when finally Freeman out of patience tore Emily from her mother by main force the two clinging to each other with all their might Don't leave me mama don't leave me screamed the child as its mother was pushed harshly forward Don't leave me come back mama she still cried stretching forth her little arms imploringly But she cried in vain Out of the door and into the street we were quickly hurried Still we could hear her calling to her mother Come back don't leave me come back mama until her infant voice grew faint and still more faint and gradually died away as distance intervened and finally was wholly lost Eliza never after saw or heard of Emily or Randall Day nor night however were they ever absent from her memory In the cotton field in the cabin always and everywhere she was talking of them often to them as if they were actually present Only when absorbed in that illusion or asleep did she ever have a moment's comfort afterwards She was no common slave as has been said To a large share of natural intelligence which she possessed was added a general knowledge and information on most subjects She had enjoyed opportunities such as are afforded to very few of her oppressed class She had been lifted up into the regions of a higher life Freedom freedom for herself and for her offspring for many years had been her cloud by day her pillar of fire by night In her pilgrimage through the wilderness of bondage with eyes fixed upon that hope inspiring beacon she had at length ascended to the top of Pisgah and beheld the land of promise In an unexpected moment she was utterly overwhelmed with disappointment and despair The glorious vision of liberty faded from her sight as they led her away into captivity Now she weepeth sore in the night and tears are on her cheeks all her friends have dealt treacherously with her they have become her enemies VII THE STEAMBOAT RODOLPH DEPARTURE FROM NEW ORLEANS WILLIAM FORD ARRIVAL AT ALEXANDRIA ON RED RIVER RESOLUTIONS THE GREAT PINE WOODS WILD CATTLE MARTIN'S SUMMER RESIDENCE THE TEXAS ROAD ARRIVAL AT MASTER FORD'S ROSE MISTRESS FORD SALLY AND HER CHILDREN JOHN THE COOK WALTER SAM AND ANTONY THE MILLS ON INDIAN CREEK SABBATH DAYS SAM'S CONVERSION THE PROFIT OF KINDNESS RAFTING ADAM TAYDEM THE LITTLE WHITE MAN CASCALLA AND HIS TRIBE THE INDIAN BALL JOHN TIBEATS THE STORM APPROACHING ON leaving the New Orleans slave pen Harry and I followed our new master through the streets while Eliza crying and turning back was forced along by Freeman and his minions until we found ourselves on board the steamboat Rodolph then lying at the levee In the course of half an hour we were moving briskly up the Mississippi bound for some point on Red River There were quite a number of slaves on board beside ourselves just purchased in the New Orleans market I remember a Mr Kelsow who was said to be a well known and extensive planter had in charge a gang of women Our master's name was William Ford He resided then in the Great Pine Woods in the parish of Avoyelles situated on the right bank of Red River in the heart of Louisiana He is now a Baptist preacher Throughout the whole parish of Avoyelles and especially along both shores of Bayou Boeuf where he is more intimately known he is accounted by his fellow citizens as a worthy minister of God In many northern minds perhaps the idea of a man holding his brother man in servitude and the traffic in human flesh may seem altogether incompatible with their conceptions of a moral or religious life From descriptions of such men as Burch and Freeman and others hereinafter mentioned they are led to despise and execrate the whole class of slaveholders indiscriminately But I was sometime his slave and had an opportunity of learning well his character and disposition and it is but simple justice to him when I say in my opinion there never was a more kind noble candid Christian man than William Ford The influences and associations that had always surrounded him blinded him to the inherent wrong at the bottom of the system of Slavery He never doubted the moral right of one man holding another in subjection Looking through the same medium with his fathers before him he saw things in the same light Brought up under other circumstances and other influences his notions would undoubtedly have been different Nevertheless he was a model master walking uprightly according to the light of his understanding and fortunate was the slave who came to his possession Were all men such as he Slavery would be deprived of more than half its bitterness We were two days and three nights on board the steamboat Rodolph during which time nothing of particular interest occurred I was now known as Platt the name given me by Burch and by which I was designated through the whole period of my servitude Eliza was sold by the name of Dradey She was so distinguished in the conveyance to Ford now on record in the recorder's office in New Orleans On our passage I was constantly reflecting on my situation and consulting with myself on the best course to pursue in order to effect my ultimate escape Sometimes not only then but afterwards I was almost on the point of disclosing fully to Ford the facts of my history I am inclined now to the opinion it would have resulted in my benefit This course was often considered but through fear of its miscarriage never put into execution until eventually my transfer and his pecuniary embarrassments rendered it evidently unsafe Afterwards under other masters unlike William Ford I knew well enough the slightest knowledge of my real character would consign me at once to the remoter depths of Slavery I was too costly a chattel to be lost and was well aware that I would be taken farther on into some by place over the Texan border perhaps and sold that I would be disposed of as the thief disposes of his stolen horse if my right to freedom was even whispered So I resolved to lock the secret closely in my heart never to utter one word or syllable as to who or what I was trusting in Providence and my own shrewdness for deliverance At length we left the steamboat Rodolph at a place called Alexandria several hundred miles from New Orleans It is a small town on the southern shore of Red River Having remained there over night we entered the morning train of cars and were soon at Bayou Lamourie a still smaller place distant eighteen miles from Alexandria At that time it was the termination of the railroad Ford's plantation was situated on the Texas road twelve miles from Lamourie in the Great Pine Woods This distance it was announced to us must be traveled on foot there being public conveyances no farther Accordingly we all set out in the company of Ford It was an excessively hot day Harry Eliza and myself were yet weak and the bottoms of our feet w were very tender from the effects of the small pox We proceeded slowly Ford telling us to take our time and sit down and rest whenever we desired a privilege that was taken advantage of quite frequently After leaving Lamourie and crossing two plantations one belonging to Mr Carnell the other to a Mr Flint we reached the Pine Woods a wilderness that stretches to the Sabine River The whole country about Red River is low and marshy The Pine Woods as they are called is comparatively upland with frequent small intervals however running through them This upland is covered with numerous trees the white oak the chincopin resembling chestnut but principally the yellow pine They are of great size running up sixty feet and perfectly straight The woods were full of cattle very shy and wild dashing away in herds with a loud snuff at our approach Some of them were marked or branded the rest appeared to be in their wild and untamed state They are much smaller than northern breeds and the peculiarity about them that most attracted my attention was their horns They stand out from the sides of the head precisely straight like two iron spikes At noon we reached a cleared piece of ground containing three or four acres Upon it was a small unpainted wooden house a corn crib or as we would say a barn and a log kitchen standing about a rod from the house It was the summer residence of Mr Martin Rich planters having large establishments on Bayou Boeuf are accustomed to spend the warmer season in these woods Here they find clear water and delightful shades In fact these retreats are to the planters of that section of the country what Newport and Saratoga are to the wealthier inhabitants of northern cities We were sent around into the kitchen and supplied with sweet potatoes corn bread and bacon while Master Ford dined with Martin in the house There were several slaves about the premises Martin came out and took a look at us asking Ford the price of each if we were green hands and so forth and making inquiries in relation to the slave market generally After a long rest we set forth again following the Texas road which had the appearance of being very rarely traveled For five miles we passed through continuous woods without observing a single habitation At length just as the sun was sinking in the west we entered another opening containing some twelve or fifteen acres In this opening stood a house much larger than Mr Martin's It was two stories high with a piazza in front In the rear of it was also a log kitchen poultry house corncribs and several negro cabins Near the house was a peach orchard and gardens of orange and pomegranate trees The space was entirely surrounded by woods and covered with a carpet of rich rank verdure It was a quiet lonely pleasant place literally a green spot in the wilderness It was the residence of my master William Ford As we approached a yellow girl her name was Rose was standing on the piazza Going to the door she called her mistress who presently came running out to meet her lord She kissed him and laughingly demanded if he had bought those niggers Ford said he had and told us to go round to Sally's cabin and rest ourselves Turning the corner of the house we discovered Sally washing her two baby children near her rolling on the grass They jumped up and toddled towards us looked at us a moment like a brace of rabbits then ran back to their mother as if afraid of us Sally conducted us into the cabin told us to lay down our bundles and be seated for she was sure that we were tired Just then John the cook a boy some sixteen years of age and blacker than any crow came running in looked steadily in our faces then turning round without saying as much as how d'ye do ran back to the kitchen laughing loudly as if our coming was a great joke indeed Much wearied with our walk as soon as it was dark Harry and I wrapped our blankets round us and laid down upon the cabin floor My thoughts as usual wandered back to my wife and children The consciousness of my real situation the hopelessness of any effort to escape through the wide forests of Avoyelles pressed heavily upon me yet my heart was at home in Saratoga I was awakened early in the morning by the voice of Master Ford calling Rose She hastened into the house to dress the children Sally to the field to milk the cows while John was busy in the kitchen preparing breakfast In the meantime Harry and I were strolling about the yard looking at our new quarters Just after breakfast a colored man driving three yoke of oxen attached to a wagon load of lumber drove into the opening He was a slave of Ford's named Walton the husband of Rose By the way Rose was a native of Washington and had been brought from thence five years before She had never seen Eliza but she had heard of Berry and they knew the same streets and the same people either personally or by reputation They became fast friends immediately and talked a great deal together of old times and of friends they had left behind Ford was at that time a wealthy man Besides his seat in the Pine Woods he owned a large lumbering establishment on Indian Creek four miles distant and also in his wife's right an extensive plantation and many slaves on Bayou Boeuf Walton had come with his load of lumber from the mills on Indian Creek Ford directed us to return with him saying he would follow us as soon as possible Before leaving Mistress Ford called me into the storeroom and handed me as it is there termed a tin bucket of molasses for Harry and myself Eliza was still ringing her hands and deploring the loss of her children Ford tried as much as possible to console her told her she need not work very hard that she might remain with Rose and assist the madam in the house affairs Riding with Walton in the wagon Harry and I became quite well acquainted with him long before reaching Indian Creek He was a born thrall of Ford's and spoke kindly and affectionately of him as a child would speak of his own father In answer to his inquiries from whence I came I told him from Washington Of that city he had heard much from his wife Rose and all the way plied me with many extravagant and absurd questions On reaching the mills at Indian Creek we found two more of Ford's slaves Sam and Antony Sam also was a Washingtonian having been brought out in the same gang with Rose He had worked on a farm near Georgetown Antony was a blacksmith from Kentucky who had been in his present master's service about ten years Sam knew Burch and when informed that he was the trader who had sent me on from Washington it was remarkable how well we agreed upon the subject of his superlative rascality He had forwarded Sam also On Ford's arrival at the mill we were employed in piling lumber and chopping logs which occupation we continued during the remainder of the summer We usually spent our Sabbaths at the opening on which days our master would gather all his slaves about him and read and expound the Scriptures He sought to inculcate in our minds feelings of kindness towards each other of dependence upon God setting forth the rewards promised unto those who lead an upright and prayerful life Seated in the doorway of his house surrounded by his man servants and his maid servants who looded earnestly into the good man's face he spoke of the loving kindness of the Creator and of the life that is to come Often did the voice of prayer ascend from his lips to heaven the only sound that broke the solitude of the place In the course of the summer Sam became deeply convicted his mind dwelling intensely on the subject of religion His mistress gave him a Bible which he carried with him to his work Whatever leisure time was allowed him he spent in perusing it though it was only with great difficulty that he could master any part of it I often read to him a favor which he well repaid me by many expressions of gratitude Sam's piety was frequently observed by white men who came to the mill and the remark it most generally provoked was that a man like Ford who allowed his slaves to have Bibles was not fit to own a nigger He however lost nothing by his kindness It is a fact I have more than once observed that those who treated their slaves most leniently were rewarded by the greatest amount of labor I know it from my own experience It was a source of pleasure to surprise Master Ford with a greater day's work than was required while under subsequent masters there was no prompter to extra effort but the overseer's lash It was the desire of Ford's approving voice that suggested to me an idea that resulted to his profit The lumber we were manufacturing was contracted to be delivered at Lamourie It had hitherto been transported by land and was an important item of expense Indian Creek upon which the mills were situated was a narrow but deep stream emptying into Bayou Boeuf In some places it was not more than twelve feet wide and much obstructed with trunks of trees Bayou Boeuf was connected with Bayou Lamourie I ascertained the distance from the mills to the point on the latter bayou where our lumber was to be delivered was but a few miles less by land than by water Provided the creek could be made navigable for rafts it occurred to me that the expense of transportation would be materially diminished Adam Taydem a little white man who had been a soldier in Florida and had strolled into that distant region was foreman and superintendent of the mills He scouted the idea but Ford when I laid it before him received it favorably and permitted me to try the experiment Having removed the obstructions I made up a narrow raft consisting of twelve cribs At this business I think I was quite skillful not having forgotten my experience years before on the Champlain canal I labored hard being extremely anxious to succeed both from a desire to please my master and to show Adam Taydem that my scheme was not such a visionary one as he incessantly pronounced it One hand could manage three cribs I took charge of the forward three and commenced poling down the creek In due time we entered the first bayou and finally reached our destination in a shorter period of time than I had anticipated The arrival of the raft at Lamourie created a sensation while Mr Ford loaded me with commendation On all sides I heard Ford's Platt pronounced the smartest nigger in the Pine Woods in fact I was the Fulton of Indian Creek I was not insensible to the praise bestowed upon me and enjoyed especially my triumph over Taydem whose half malicious ridicule had stung my pride From this time the entire control of bringing the lumber to Lamourie was placed in my hands until the contract was fulfilled Indian Creek in its whole length flows through a magnificent forest There dwells on its shore a tribe of Indians a remnant of the Chickasaws or Chickopees if I remember rightly They live in simple huts ten or twelve feet square constructed of pine poles and covered with bark They subsist principally on the flesh of the deer the coon and opossum all of which are plenty in these woods Sometimes they exchange venison for a little corn and whisky with the planters on the bayous Their usual dress is buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic colors buttoned from belt to chin They wear brass rings on their wrists and in their ears and noses The dress of the squaws is very similar They are fond of dogs and horses owning many of the latter of a small tough breed and are skillful riders Their bridles girths and saddles were made of raw skins of animals their stirrups of a certain kind of wood Mounted astride their ponies men and women I have seen them dash out into the woods at the utmost of their speed following narrow winding paths and dodging trees in a manner that eclipsed the most miraculous feats of civilized equestrianism Circling away in various directions the forest echoing and re echoing with their whoops they would presently return at the same dashing headlong speed with which they started Their village was on Indian Creek known as Indian Castle but their range extended to the Sabine River Occasionally a tribe from Texas would come over on a visit and then there was indeed a carnival in the Great Pine Woods Chief of the tribe was Cascalla second in rank John Baltese his son in law with both of whom as with many others of the tribe I became acquainted during my frequent voyages down the creek with rafts Sam and myself would often visit them when the day's task w as done They were obedient to the chief the word of Cascalla was their law They were a rude but harmless people and enjoyed their wild mode of life They had little fancy for the open country the cleared lands on the shores of the bayous but preferred to hide themselves within the shadows of the forest They worshiped the Great Spirit loved whisky and were happy On one occasion I was present at a dance when a roving herd from Texas had encamped in their village The entire carcass of a deer was roasting before a large fire which threw its light a long distance among the trees under which they were assembled When they had formed in a ring men and squaws alternately a sort of Indian fiddle set up an indescribable tune It was a continuous melancholy kind of wavy sound with the slightest possible variation At the first note if indeed there was more than one note in the whole tune they circled around trotting after each other and giving utterance to a guttural sing song noise equally as nondescript as the music of the fiddle At the end of the third circuit they would stop suddenly whoop as if their lungs would crack then break from the ring forming in couples man and squaw each jumping backwards as far as possible from the other then forwards which graceful feat having been twice or thrice accomplished they would form in a ring and go trotting round again The best dancer appeared to be considered the one who could whoop the loudest jump the farthest and utter the most excruciating noise At intervals one or more would leave the dancing circle and going to the fire cut from the roasting carcass a slice of venison In a hole shaped like a mortar cut in the trunk of a fallen tree they pounded corn with a wooden pestle and of the meal made cake Alternately they danced and ate Thus were the visitors from Texas entertained by the dusky sons and daughters of the Chicopees and such is a description as I saw it of an Indian ball in the Pine Woods of Avoyelles In the autumn I left the mills and was employed at the opening One day the mistress was urging Ford to procure a loom in order that Sally might commence weaving cloth for the winter garments of the slaves He could not imagine where one was to be found when I suggested that the easiest way to get one would be to make it informing him at the same time that I was a sort of Jack at all trades and would attempt it with his permission It was granted very readily and I was allowed to go to a neighboring planter's to inspect one before commencing the undertaking At length it was finished and pronounced by Sally to be perfect She could easily weave her task of fourteen yards milk the cows and have leisure time besides each day It worked so well I was continued in the employment of making looms which were taken down to the plantation on the bayou At this time one John M Tibeats a capenter came to the opening to do some work on master's house I was directed to quit the looms and assist him For two weeks I was in his company planing and matching boards for ceiling a plastered room being a rare thing in the parish of Avoyelles John M Tibeats was the opposite of Ford in all respects He was a small crabbed quick tempered spiteful man He had no fixed residence that I ever heard of but passed from one plantation to another wherever he could find employment He was without standing in the community not esteemed by white men nor even respected by slaves He was ignorant withal and of a revengeful disposition He left the parish long before I did and I know not whether he is at present alive or dead Certain it is it was a most unlucky day for me that brought us together During my residence with Master Ford I had seen only the bright side of slavery His was no heavy hand crushing us to the earth He pointed upwards and with benign and cheering words addressed us as his fellow mortals accountable like himself to the Maker of us all I think of him with affection and had my family been with me could have borne his gentle servitude without murmuring all my days But clouds were gathering in the horizon forerunners of a pitiless storm that was soon to break over me I was doomed to endure such bitter trials as the poor slave only knows and to lead no more the comparatively happy life which I had led in the Great Pine Woods VIII FORD'S EMBARRASSMENTS THE SALE TO TIBEATS THE CHATTEL MORTGAGE MISTRESS FORD'S PLANTATION ON BAYOU BOEUF DESCRIPTION OF THE LATTER FORD'S BROTHER IN LAW PETER TANNER MEETING WITH ELIZA SHE STILL MOURNS FOR HER CHILDREN FORD'S OVERSEER CHAPIN TIBEAT'S ABUSE THE KEG OF NAILS THE FIRST FIGHT WITH TIBEATS HIS DISCOMFITURE AND CASTIGATION THE ATTEMPT TO HANG ME CHAPIN'S INTERFERENCE AND SPEECH UNHAPPY REFLECTIONS ABRUPT DEPARTURE OF TIBEATS COOK AND RAMSAY LAWSON AND THE BROWN MULE MESSAGE TO THE PINE WOODS William Ford unfortunately became embarrassed in his pecuniary affairs A heavy judgement was rendered against him in consequence of his having become security for his brother Franklin Ford residing on Red River above Alexandria and who had failed to meet his liabilities He was also indebted to John M Tibeats to a considerable amount in consideration of his services in building the mills on Indian Creek and also a weaving house corn mill and other erections on the plantation at Bayou Boeuf not yet completed It was therefore necessary in order to meet these demands to dispose of eighteen slaves myself among the number Seventeen of them including Sam and Harry were purchased by Peter Compton a planter also residing on Red River I was sold to Tibeats in consequence undoubtedly of my slight skill as a carpenter This was in the winter of The deed of myself from Freeman to Ford as I ascertained from the public records in New Orleans on my return was dated June d At the time of my sale to Tibeats the price agreed to be given for me being more than the debt Ford took a chattel mortgage of four hundred dollars I am indebted for my life as will hereafter be seen to that mortgage I bade farewell to my good friends at the opening and departed with my new master Tibeats We went down to the plantation on Bayou Boeuf distant twenty seven miles from the Pine Woods to complete the unfinished contract Bayou Boeuf is a sluggish winding stream one of those stagnant bodies of water common in that region setting back from Red River It stretches from a point not far from Alexandra in a south easterly direction and following its tortuous course is more than fifty miles in length Large cotton and sugar plantations line each shore extending back to the borders of interminable swamps It is alive with aligators rendering it unsafe for swine or unthinking slave children to stroll along its banks Upon a bend in this bayou a short distance from Cheneyville was situated the plantation of Madam Ford her brother Peter Tanner a great landholder living on the opposite side On my arrival at Bayou Boeuf I had the pleasure of meeting Eliza whom I had not seen for several months She had not pleased Mrs Ford being more occupied in brooding over her sorrows than in attending to her business and had in consequence been sent down to work in the field on the plantation She had grown feeble and emaciated and was still mourning for her children She asked me if I had forgotten them and a great many times inquired if I still remembered how handsome little Emily was how much Randall loved her and wondered if they were living still and where the darlings could then be She had sunk beneath the weight of an excessive grief Her drooping form and hollow cheeks too plainly indicated that she had well nigh reached the end of her weary road Ford's overseer on this plantation and who had the exclusive charge of it was a Mr Chapin a kindly disposed man and a native of Pennsylvania In common with others he held Tibeats in light estimation which fact in connection with the four hundred dollar mortgage was fortunate for me I was now compelled to labor very hard From earliest dawn until late at night I was not allowed to be a moment idle Notwithstanding which Tibeats was never satisfied He was continually cursing and complaining He never spoke to me a kind word I was his faithful slave and earned him large wages every day and yet I went to my cabin nightly loaded with abuse and stinging epithets We had completed the corn mill the kitchen an so forth and were at work upon the weaving house when I was guilty of an act in that State punishable with death It was my first fight with Tibeats The weaving house we were erecting stood in the orchard a few rods from the residence of Chapin or the great house as it was called One night having worked until it was too dark to see I was ordered by Tibeats to rise very early in the morning procure a keg of nails from Chapin and commence putting on the clapboards I retired to the cabin extremely tired and having cooked a supper of bacon and corn cake and conversed a while with Eliza who occupied the same cabin as also did Lawson and his wife Mary and a slave named Bristol laid down upon the ground floor little dreaming of the sufferings that awaited me on the morrow Before daylight I was on the piazza of the great house awaiting the appearance of overseer Chapin To have aroused him from his slumbers and stated my errand would have been an unpardonable boldness At length he came out Taking off my hat I informed him Master Tibeats had directed me to call upon him for a keg of nails Going into the store room he rolled it out at the same time saying if Tibeats preferred a different size he would endeavor to furnish them but that I might use those until further directed Then mounting his horse which stood saddled and bridled at the door he rode away into the field whither the slaves had preceded him while I took the keg on my shoulder and proceeding to the weaving house broke in the head and commenced nailing on the clapboards As the day began to open Tibeats came out of the house to where I was hard at work He seemed to be that morning even more morose and disagreeable than usual He was my master entitled by law to my flesh and blood and to exercise over me such tyrannical control as his mean nature prompted but there was no law that could prevent my looking upon him with intense contempt I despised both his disposition and his intellect I had just come round to the keg for a further supply of nails as he reached the weaving house I thought I told you to commence putting on weather boards this morning he remarked Yes master and I am about it I replied Where he demanded On the other side was my answer He walked round to the other side examined my work for a while muttering to himself in a fault finding tone Didn't I tell you last night to get a keg of nails of Chapin he broke forth again Yes master and so I did and overseer said he would get another size for you if you wanted them when he came back from the field Tibeats walked to the keg looked a moment at the contents then kicked it violently Coming towards me in a great passion he exclaimed G d d n you I thought you knowed something I made answer I tried to do as you told me master I didn't mean anything wrong Overseer said But he interrupted me with such a flood of curses that I was unable to finish the sentence At length he ran towards the house and going to the piazza took down one of the overseer's whips The whip had a short wooden stock braided over with leather and was loaded at the butt The lash was three feet long or thereabouts and made of raw hide strands At first I was somewhat frightened and my impulse was to run There was no one about except Rachel the cook and Chapin's wife and neither of them were to be seen The rest were in the field I knew he intended to whip me and it was the first time any one had attempted it since my arrival at Avoyelles I felt moreover that I had been faithful that I was guilty of no wrong whatever and deserved commendation rather than punishment My fear changed to anger and before he reached me I had made up my mind fully not to be whipped let the result be life or death Winding the lash around his hand and taking hold of the small end of the stock he walked up to me and with a malignant look ordered me to strip Master Tibeats said I looking him boldly in the face I will not I was about to say something further in justification but with concentrated vengeance he sprang upon me seizing me by the throat with one hand raising the whip with the other in the act of striking Before the blow descended however I had caught him by the collar of the coat and drawn him closely to me Reaching down I seized him by the ankle and pushing him back with the other hand he fell over on the ground Putting one arm around his leg and holding it to my breast so that his head and shoulders only touched the ground I placed my foot upon his neck He was completely in my power My blood was up It seemed to course through my veins like fire In the frenzy of my madness I snatched the whip from his hand He struggled with all his power swore that I should not live to see another day and that he would tear out my heart But his struggles and his threats were alike in vain I cannot tell how many times I struck him Blow after blow fell fast and heavy upon his wriggling form At length he screamed cried murder and at last the blasphemous tyrant called on God for mercy But he who had never shown mercy did not receive it The stiff stock of the whip warped round his cringing body until my right arm ached Until this time I had been too busy to look about me Desisting for a moment I saw Mrs Chapin looking from the window and Rachel standing in the kitchen door Their attitudes expressed the utmost excitement and alarm His screams had been heard in the field Chapin was coming as fast as he could ride I struck him a blow or two more then pushed him from me with such a well directed kick that he went rolling over on the ground Rising to his feet and brushing the dirt from his hair he stood looking at me pale with rage We gazed at each other in silence Not a word was uttered until Chapin galloped up to us What is the matter he cried out Master Tibeats wants to whip me for using the nails you gave me I replied What is the matter with the nails he inquired turning to Tibeats Tibeats answered to the effect that they were too large paying little heed however to Chapin's question but still keeping his snakish eyes fastened maliciously on me I am overseer here Chapin began I told Platt to take them and use them and if they were not of the proper size I would get others on returning from the field It is not his fault Besides I shall furnish such nails as I please I hope you will understand that Mr Tibeats Tibeats made no reply but grinding his teeth and shaking his fist swore he would have satisfaction and that it was not half over yet Thereupon he walked away followed by the overseer and entered the house the latter talking to him all the while in a suppressed tone and with earnest gestures I remained where I was doubting whether it was better to fly or abide the result whatever it might be Presently Tibeats came out of the house and saddling his horse the only property he possessed besides myself departed on the road to Chenyville When he was gone Chapin came out visibly excited telling me not to stir not to attempt to leave the plantation on any account whatever He then went to the kitchen and calling Rachel out conversed with her some time Coming back he again charged me with great earnestness not to run saying my master was a rascal that he had left on no good errand and that there might be trouble before night But at all events he insisted upon it I must not stir As I stood there feelings of unutterable agony overwhelmed me I was conscious that I had subjected myself to unimaginable punishment The reaction that followed my extreme ebullition of anger produced the most painful sensations of regret An unfriended helpless slave what could I do what could I say to justify in the remotest manner the heinous act I had committed of resenting a white man's contumely and abuse I tried to pray I tried to beseech my Heavenly Father to sustain me in my sore extremity but emotion choked my utterance and I could only bow my head upon my hands and weep For at least an hour I remained in this situation finding relief only in tears when looking up I beheld Tibeats accompanied by two horsemen coming down the bayou They rode into the yard jumped from their horses and approached me with large whips one of them also carrying a coil of rope Cross your hands commanded Tibeats with the addition of such a shuddering expression of blasphemy as is not decorous to repeat You need not bind me Master Tibeats I am ready to go with you anywhere said I One of his companions then stepped forward swearing if I made the least resistance he would break my head he would tear me limb from limb he would cut my black throat and giving wide scope to other similar expressions Perceiving any importunity altogether vain I crossed my hands submitting humbly to whatever disposition they might please to make of me Thereupon Tibeats tied my wrists drawing the rope around them with his utmost strength Then he bound my ankles in the same manner In the meantime the other two had slipped a cord within my elbows running it across my back and tying it firmly It was utterly impossible to move hand or foot With a remaining piece of rope Tibeats made an awkward noose and placed it about my neck Now then inquired one of Tibeats' companions where shall we hang the nigger One proposed such a limb extending from the body of a peach tree near the spot where we were standing His comrade objected to it alleging it would break and proposed another Finally they fixed upon the latter During this conversation and all the time they were binding me I uttered not a word Overseer Chapin during the progress of the scene was walking hastily back and forth on the piazza Rachel was crying by the kitchen door and Mrs Chapin was still looking from the window Hope died within my heart Surely my time had come I should never behold the light of another day never behold the faces of my children the sweet anticipation I had cherished with such fondness I should that hour struggle through the fearful agonies of death None would mourn for me none revenge me Soon my form would be mouldering in that distant soil or perhaps be cast to the slimy reptiles that filled the stagnant waters of the bayou Tears flowed down my cheeks but they only afforded a subject of insulting comment for my executioners At length as they were dragging me towards the tree Chapin who had momentarily disappeared from the piazza came out of the house and walked towards us He had a pistol in each hand and as near as I can now recall to mind spoke in a firm determined manner as follows Gentlemen I have a few words to say You had better listen to them Whoever moves that slave another foot from where he stands is a dead man In the first place he does not deserve this treatment It is a shame to murder him in this manner I never knew a more faithful boy than Platt You Tibeats are in the fault yourself You are pretty much of a scoundrel and I know it and you richly deserve the flogging you have received In the next place I have been overseer on this plantation seven years and in the absence of William Ford am master here My duty is to protect his interests and that duty I shall perform You are not responsible you are a worthless fellow Ford holds a mortgage on Platt of four hundred dollars If you hang him he loses his debt Until that is canceled you have no right to take his life You have no right to take it any way There is a law for the slave as well as for the white man You are no better than a murderer As for you addressing Cook and Ramsay a couple of overseers from neighboring plantations as for you begone If you have any regard for your own safety I say begone Cook and Ramsay without a further word mounted their horses and rode away Tibeats in a few minutes evidently in fear and overawed by the decided tone of Chapin sneaked off like a coward as he was and mounting his horse followed his companions I remained standing where I was still bound with the rope around my neck As soon as they were gone Chapin called Rachel ordering her to run to the field and tell Lawson to hurry to the house without delay and bring the brown mule with him an animal much prized for its unusual fleetness Presently the boy appeared Lawson said Chapin you must go to the Pine Woods Tell your master Ford to come here at once that he must not delay a single moment Tell him they are trying to murder Platt Now hurry boy Be at the Pine Woods by noon if you kill the mule Chapin stepped into the house and wrote a pass When he returned Lawson was at the door mounted on his mule Receiving the pass he plied the whip right smartly to the beast dashed out of the yard and turning up the bayou on a hard gallop in less time than it has taken me to describe the scene was out of sight IX THE HOT SUN YET BOUND THE CORDS SINK INTO MY FLESH CHAPIN'S UNEASINESS SPECULATION RACHEL AND HER CUP OF WATER SUFFERING INCREASES THE HAPPINESS OF SLAVERY ARRIVAL OF FORD HE CUTS THE CORDS WHICH BIND ME AND TAKES THE ROPE FROM MY NECK MISERY THE GATHERING OF THE SLAVES IN ELIZA'S CABIN THEIR KINDNESS RACHEL REPEATS THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY LAWSON ENTERTAINS HIS COMPANIONS WITH AN ACCOUNT OF HIS RIDE CHAPIN'S APPREHENSIONS OF TIBEATS HIRED TO PETER TANNER PETER EXPOUNDS THE SCRIPTURES DESCRIPTION OF THE STOCKS As the sun approached the meridian that day it became insufferably warm Its hot rays scorched the ground The earth almost blistered the foot that stood upon it I was without coat or hat standing bareheaded exposed to its burning blaze Great drops of perspiration rolled down my face drenching the scanty apparel wherewith I was clothed Over the fence a very little way off the peach trees cast their cool delicious shadows on the grass I would gladly have given a long year of service to have been enabled to exchange the heated oven as it were wherein I stood for a seat beneath their branches But I was yet bound the rope still dangling from my neck and standing in the same tracks where Tibeats and his comrades left me I could not move an inch so firmly had I been bound To have been enabled to lean against the weaving house would have been a luxury indeed But it was far beyond my reach though distant less than twenty feet I wanted to lie down but knew I could not rise again The ground was so parched and boiling hot I was aware it would but add to the discomfort of my situation If I could have only moved my position however slightly it would have been relief unspeakable But the hot rays of a southern sun beating all the long summer day on my bare head produced not half the suffering I experienced from my aching limbs My wrists and ankles and the cords of my legs and arms began to swell burying the rope that bound them into the swollen flesh All day Chapin walked back and forth upon the stoop but not once approached me He appeared to be in a state of great uneasiness looking first towards me and then up the road as if expecting some arrival every moment He did not go to the field as was his custom It was evident from his manner that he supposed Tibeats would return with more and better armed assistance perhaps to renew the quarrel and it was equally evident he had prepared his mind to defend my life at whatever hazard Why he did not relieve me why he suffered me to remain in agony the whole weary day I never knew It was not for want of sympathy I am certain Perhaps he wished Ford to see the rope about my neck and the brutal manner in which I had been bound perhaps his interference with another's property in which he had no legal interest might have been a trespass which would have subjected him to the penalty of the law Why Tibeats was all day absent was another mystery I never could divine He knew well enough that Chapin would not harm him unless he persisted in his design against me Lawson told me afterwards that as he passed the plantation of John David Cheney he saw the three and that they turned and looked after him as he flew by I think his supposition was that Lawson had been sent out by Overseer Chapin to arouse the neighboring planters and to call on them to come to his assistance He therefore undoubtedly acted on the principle that discretion is the better part of valor and kept away But whatever motive may have governed the cowardly and malignant tyrant it is of no importance There I still stood in the noon tide sun groaning with pain From long before daylight I had not eaten a morsel I was growing faint from pain and thirst and hunger Once only in the very hottest portion of the day Rachel half fearful she was acting contrary to the overseer's wishes ventured to me and held a cup of water to my lips The humble creature never knew nor could she comprehend if she had heard them the blessings I invoked upon her for that balmy draught She could only say Oh Platt how I do pity you and then hastened back to her labors in the kitchen Never did the sun move so slowly through the heavens never did it shower down such fervent and fiery rays as it did that day At least so it appeared to me What my meditations were the innumerable thoughts that thronged through my distracted brain I will not attempt to give expression to Suffice it to say during the whole long day I came not to the conclusion even once that the southern slave fed clothed whipped and protected by his master is happier than the free colored citizen of the North To that conclusion I have never since arrived There are many however even in the Northern States benevolent and well disposed men who will pronounce my opinion erroneous and gravely proceed to substantiate the assertion with an argument Alas they have never drank as I have from the bitter cup of slavery Just at sunset my heart leaped with unbounded joy as Ford came riding into the yard his horse covered with foam Chapin met him at the door and after conversing a short time he walked directly to me Poor Platt you are in a bad state was the only expression that escaped his lips Thank God said I thank God Master Ford that you have come at last Drawing a knife from his pocket he indignantly cut the cord from my wrists arms and ankles and slipped the noose from my neck I attempted to walk but staggered like a drunken man and fell partially to the ground Ford returned immediately to the house leaving me alone again As he reached the piazza Tibeats and his two friends rode up A long dialogue followed I could hear the sound of their voices the mild tones of Ford mingling with the angry accents of Tibeats but was unable to distinguish what was said Finally the three departed again apparently not well pleased I endeavored to raise the hammer thinking to show Ford how willing I was to work by proceeding with my labors on the weaving house but it fell from my nerveless hand At dark I crawled into the cabin and laid down I was in great misery all sore and swollen the slightest movement producing excruciating suffering Soon the hands came in from the field Rachel when she went after Lawson had told them what had happened Eliza and Mary broiled me a piece of bacon but my appetite was gone Then they scorched some corn meal and made coffee It was all that I could take Eliza consoled me and was very kind It was not long before the cabin was full of slaves They gathered round me asking many questions about the difficulty with Tibeats in the morning and the particulars of all the occurrences of the day Then Rachel came in and in her simple language repeated it over again dwelling emphatically on the kick that sent Tibeats rolling over on the ground whereupon there was a general titter throughout the crowd Then she described how Chapin walked out with his pistols and rescued me and how Master Ford cut the ropes with his knife just as if he was mad By this time Lawson had returned He had to regale them with an account of his trip to the Pine Woods how the brown mule bore him faster than a streak o' lightnin how he astonished everybody as he flew along how Master Ford started right away how he said Platt was a good nigger and they shouldn't kill him concluding with pretty strong intimations that there was not another human being in the wide world who could have created such a universal sensation on the road or performed such a marvelous John Gilpin feat as he had done that day on the brown mule The kind creatures loaded me with the expression of their sympathy saying Tibeats was a hard cruel man and hoping Massa Ford would get me back again In this manner they passed the time discussing chatting talking over end over again the exciting affair until suddenly Chapin presented himself at the cabin door and called me Platt said he you will sleep on the floor in the great house to night bring your blanket with you I arose as quickly as I was able took my blanket in my hand and followed him On the way he informed me that he should not wonder if Tibeats was back again before morning that he intended to kill me and that he did not mean he should do it without witnesses Had he stabbed me to the heart in the presence of a hundred slaves not one of them by the laws of Louisiana could have given evidence against him I laid down on the floor in the great house the first and the last time such a sumptuous resting place was granted me during my twelve years of bondage and tried to sleep Near midnight the dog began to bark Chapin arose looked from the window but could discover nothing At length the dog was quiet As he returned to his room he said I believe Platt that scoundrel is skulking about the premises somewhere If the dog barks again and I am sleeping wake me I promised to do so After the lapse of an hour or more the dog re commenced his clamor running towards the gate then back again all the while barking furiously Chapin was out of bed without waiting to be called On this occasion he stepped forth upon the piazza and remained standing there a considerable length of time Nothing however was to be seen and the dog returned to his kennel We were not disturbed again during the night The excessive pain that I suffered and the dread of some impending danger prevented any rest whatever Whether or not Tibeats did actually return to the plantation that night seeking an opportunity to wreak his vengeance upon me is a secret known only to himself perhaps I thought then however and have the strong impression still that he was there At all events he had the disposition of an assassin cowering before a brave man's words but ready to strike his helpless or unsuspecting victim in the back as I had reason afterwards to know At daylight in the morning I arose sore and weary having rested little Nevertheless after partaking breakfast which Mary and Eliza had prepared for me in the cabin I proceeded to the weaving house and commenced the labors of another day It was Chapin's practice as it is the practice of overseers generally immediately on arising to bestride his horse always saddled and bridled and ready for him the particular business of some slave and ride into the field This morning on the contrary he came to the weaving house asking if I had seen anything of Tibeats yet Replying in the negative he remarked there was something not right about the fellow there was bad blood in him that I must keep a sharp watch of him or he would do me wrong some day when I least expected it While he was yet speaking Tibeats rode in hitched his horse and entered the house I had little fear of him while Ford and Chapin were at hand but they could not be near me always Oh how heavily the weight of slavery pressed upon me then I must toil day after day endure abuse and taunts and scoffs sleep on the hard ground live on the coarsest fare and not only this but live the slave of a blood seeking wretch of whom I must stand henceforth in continued fear and dread Why had I not died in my young years before God had given me children to love and live for What unhappiness and suffering and sorrow it would have prevented I sighed for liberty but the bondman's chain was round me and could not be shaken off I could only gaze wistfully towards the North and think of the thousands of miles that stretched between me and the soil of freedom over which a black freeman may not pass Tibeats in the course of half an hour walked over to the weaving house looked at me sharply then returned without saying anything Most of the forenoon he sat on the piazza reading a newspaper and conversing with Ford After dinner the latter left for the Pine Woods and it was indeed with regret that I beheld him depart from the plantation Once more during the day Tibeats came to me gave me some order and returned During the week the weaving house was completed Tibeats in the meantime making no allusion whatever to the difficulty when I was informed he had hired me to Peter Tanner to work under another carpenter by the name of Myers This announcement was received with gratification as any place was desirable that would relieve me of his hateful presence Peter Tanner as the reader has already been informed lived on the opposite shore and was the brother of Mistress Ford He is one of the most extensive planters on Bayou Boeuf and owns a large number of slaves Over I went to Tanner's joyfully enough He had heard of my late difficulties in fact I ascertained the flogging of Tibeats was soon blazoned far and wide This affair together with my rafting experiment had rendered me somewhat notorious More than once I heard it said that Platt Ford now Platt Tibeats a slave's name changes with his change of master was a devil of a nigger But I was destined to make a still further noise as will presently be seen throughout the little world of Bayou Boeuf Peter Tanner endeavored to impress upon me the idea that he was quite severe though I could perceive there was a vein of good humor in the old fellow after all You're the nigger he said to me on my arrival You're the nigger that flogged your master eh You're the nigger that kicks and holds carpenter Tibeats by the leg and wallops him are ye I'd like to see you hold me by the leg I should You're a 'portant character you're a great nigger very remarkable nigger ain't ye I'd lash you I'd take the tantrums out of ye Jest take hold of my leg if you please None of your pranks here my boy remember that Now go to work you kickin' rascal concluded Peter Tanner unable to suppress a half comical grin at his own wit and sarcasm After listening to this salutation I was taken charge of by Myers and labored under his direction for a month to his and my own satisfaction Like William Ford his brother in law Tanner was in the habit of reading the Bible to his slaves on the Sabbath but in a somewhat different spirit He was an impressive commentator on the New Testament The first Sunday after my coming to the plantation he called them together and began to read the twelfth of Luke When he came to the th verse he looked deliberately around him and continued And that servant which knew his lord's will here he paused looking around more deliberately than before and again proceeded which knew his lord's will and prepared not himself here was another pause prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes D'ye hear that demanded Peter emphatically Stripes he repeated slowly and distinctly taking off his spectacles preparatory to making a few remarks That nigger that don't take care that don't obey his lord that's his master d'ye see that 'ere nigger shall be beaten with many stripes Now 'many' signifies a great many forty a hundred a hundred and fifty lashes That's Scripter and so Peter continued to elucidate the subject for a great length of time much to the edification of his sable audience At the conclusion of the exercises calling up three of his slaves Warner Will and Major or he cried out to me Here Platt you held Tibeats by the legs now I'll see if you can hold these rascals in the same way till I get back from meetin' Thereupon he ordered them to the stocks a common thing on plantations in the Red River country The stocks are formed of two planks the lower one made fast at the ends to two short posts driven firmly into the ground At regular distances half circles are cut in the upper edge The other plank is fastened to one of the posts by a hinge so that it can be opened or shut down in the same manner as the blade of a pocket knife is shut or opened In the lower edge of the upper plank corresponding half circles are also cut so that when they close a row of holes is formed large enough to admit a negro's leg above the ankle but not large enough to enable him to draw out his foot The other end of the upper plank opposite the hinge is fastened to its post by lock and key The slave is made to sit upon the ground when the uppermost prank is elevated his legs just above the ankles placed in the sub half circles and shutting it down again and locking it he is held secure and fast Very often the neck instead of the ankle is enclosed In this manner they are held during the operation of whipping Warner Will and Major according to Tanner's account of them were melon stealing Sabbath breaking niggers and not approving of such wickedness he felt it his duty to put them in the stocks Handing me the key himself Myers Mistress Tanner and the children entered the carriage and drove away to church at Cheneyville When they were gone the boys begged me to let them out I felt sorry to see them sitting on the hot ground and remembered my own sufferings in the sun Upon their promise to return to the stocks at any moment they were required to do so I consented to release them Grateful for the lenity shown them and in order in some measure to repay it they could do no less of course than pilot me to the melon patch Shortly before Tanner's return they were in the stocks again Finally he drove up and looking at the boys said with a chuckle Aha ye havn't been strolling about much to day any way I'll teach you what's what I'll tire ye of eating water melons on the Lord's day ye Sabbath breaking niggers Peter Tanner prided himself upon his strict religious observances he was a deacon in the church But I have now reached a point in the progress of my narrative when it becomes necessary to turn away from these light descriptions to the more grave and weighty matter of the second battle with Master Tibeats and the flight through the great Pacoudrie Swamp X RETURN TO TIBEATS IMPOSSIBILITY OF PLEASING HIM HE ATTACKS ME WITH A HATCHET THE STRUGGLE OVER THE BROAD AXE THE TEMPTATION TO MURDER HIM ESCAPE ACROSS THE PLANTATION OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FENCE TIBEATS APPROACHES FOLLOWED BY THE HOUNDS THEY TAKE MY TRACK THEIR LOUD YELLS THEY ALMOST OVERTAKE ME I REACH THE WATER THE POUNDS CONFUSED MOCCASIN SNAKE ALLIGATORS NIGHT IN THE GREAT PACOUDRIE SWAMP THE SOUNDS OF LIFE NORTH WEST COURSE EMERGE INTO THE PINE WOODS THE SLAVE AND HIS YOUNG MASTER ARRIVAL AT FORD'S FOOD AND REST AT the end of a month my services being no longer required at Tanner's I was sent over the bayou again to my master whom I found engaged in building the cotton press This was situated at some distance from the great house in a rather retired place I commenced working once more in company with Tibeats being entirely alone with him most part of the time I remembered the words of Chapin his precautions his advice to beware lest in some unsuspecting moment he might injure me They were always in my mind so that I lived in a most uneasy state of apprehension and fear One eye was on my work the other on my master I determined to give him no cause of offence to work still more diligently if possible than I had done to bear whatever abuse he might heap upon me save bodily injury humbly and patiently hoping thereby to soften in some degree his manner towards me until the blessed time might come when I should be delivered from his clutches The third morning after my return Chapin left the plantation for Cheneyville to be absent until night Tibeats on that morning was attacked with one of those periodical fits of spleen and ill humor to which he was frequently subject rendering him still more disagreeable and venomous than usual It was about nine o'clock in the forenoon when I was busily employed with the jack plane on one of the sweeps Tibeats was standing by the work bench fitting a handle into the chisel with which he had been engaged previously in cutting the thread of the screw You are not planing that down enough said he It is just even with the line I replied You're a d d liar he exclaimed passionately Oh well master I said mildly I will plane it down more if you say so at the same time proceeding to do as I supposed he desired Before one shaving had been removed however he cried out saying I had now planed it too deep it was too small I had spoiled the sweep entirely Then followed curses and imprecations I had endeavored to do exactly as he directed but nothing would satisfy the unreasonable man In silence and in dread I stood by the sweep holding the jack plane in my hand not knowing what to do and not daring to be idle His anger grew more and more violent until finally with an oath such a bitter frightful oath as only Tibeats could utter he seized a hatchet from the work bench and darted towards me swearing he would cut my head open It was a moment of life or death The sharp bright blade of the hatchet glittered in the sun In another instant it would be buried in my brain and yet in that instant so quick will a man's thoughts come to him in such a fearful strait I reasoned with myself If I stood still my doom was certain if I fled ten chances to one the hatchet flying from his hand with a too deadly and unerring aim would strike me in the back There was but one course to take Springing towards him with all my power and meeting him full half way before he could bring down the blow with one hand I caught his uplifted arm with the other seized him by the throat We stood looking each other in the eyes In his I could see murder I felt as if I had a serpent by the neck watching the slightest relaxation of my gripe to coil itself round my body crushing and stinging it to death I thought to scream aloud trusting that some ear might catch the sound but Chapin was away the hands were in the field there was no living soul in sight or hearing The good genius which thus far through life has saved me from the hands of violence at that moment suggested a lucky thought With a vigorous and sudden kick that brought him on one knee with a groan I released my hold upon his throat snatched the hatchet and cast it beyond reach Frantic with rage maddened beyond control he seized a white oak stick five feet long perhaps and as large in circumference as his hand could grasp which was lying on the ground Again he rushed towards me and again I met him seized him about the waist and being the stronger of the two bore him to the earth While in that position I obtained possession of the stick and rising cast it from me also He likewise arose and ran for the broad axe on the work bench Fortunately there was a heavy plank lying upon its broad blade in such a manner that he could not extricate it before I had sprung upon his back Pressing him down closely and heavily on the plank so that the axe was held more firmly to its place I endeavored but in vain to break his grasp upon the handle In that position we remained some minutes There have been hours in my unhappy life many of them when the contemplation of death as the end of earthly sorrow of the grave as a resting place for the tired and worn out body has been pleasant to dwell upon But such contemplations vanish in the hour of peril No man in his full strength can stand undismayed in the presence of the king of terrors Life is dear to every living thing the worm that crawls upon the ground will struggle for it At that moment it was dear to me enslaved and treated as I was Not able to unloose his hand once more I seized him by the throat and this time with a vice like gripe that soon relaxed his hold He became pliant and unstrung His face that had been white with passion was now black from suffocation Those small serpent eyes that spat such venom were now full of horror two great white orbs starting from their sockets There was a lurking devil in my heart that prompted me to kill the human blood hound on the spot to retain the gripe on his accursed throat till the breath of life was gone I dared not murder him and I dared not let him live If I killed him my life must pay the forfeit if he lived my life only would satisfy his vengeance A voice within whispered me to fly To be a wanderer among the swamps a fugitive and a vagabond on the face of the earth was preferable to the life that I was leading My resolution was soon formed and swinging him from the work bench to the ground I leaped a fence near by and hurried across the plantation passing the slaves at work in the cotton field At the end of a quarter of a mile I reached the wood pasture and it was a short time indeed that I had been running it Climbing on to a high fence I could see the cotton press the great house and the space between It was a conspicuous position from whence the whole plantation was in view I saw Tibeats cross the field towards the house and enter it then he came out carrying his saddle and presently mounted his horse and galloped away I was desolate but thankful Thankful that my life was spared desolate and discouraged with the prospect before me What would become of me Who would befriend me Whither should I fly Oh God Thou who gavest me life and implanted in my bosom the love of life who filled it with emotions such as other men thy creatures have do not forsake me Have pity on the poor slave let me not perish If thou cost not protect me I am lost lost Such supplications silently and unuttered ascended from my inmost heart to Heaven But there was no answering voice no sweet low tone coming down from on high whispering to my soul It is I be not afraid I was the forsaken of God it seemed the despised and hated of men In about three fourths of an hour several of the slaves shouted and made signs for me to run Presently looking up the bayou I saw Tibeats and two others on horse back coming at a fast gait followed by a troop of dogs There were as many as eight or ten Distant as I was I knew them They belonged on the adjoining plantation The dogs used on Bayou Boeuf for hunting slaves are a kind of blood hound but a far more savage breed than is found in the Northern States They will attack a negro at their master's bidding and cling to him as the common bull dog will cling to a four footed animal Frequently their loud bay is heard in the swamps and then there is speculation as to what point the runaway will be overhauled the same as a New York hunter stops to listen to the hounds coursing along the hillsides and suggests to his companion that the fox will be taken at such a place I never knew a slave escaping with his life from Bayou Bouef One reason is they are not allowed to learn the art of swimming and are incapable of crossing the most inconsiderable stream In their flight they can go in no direction but a little way without coming to a bayou when the inevitable alternative is presented of being drowned or overtaken by the dogs In youth I had practiced in the clear streams that flow through my native district until I had become an expert swimmer and felt at home in the watery element I stood upon the fence until the dogs had reached the cotton press In an instant more their long savage yells announced they were on my track Leaping down from my position I ran towards the swamp Fear gave me strength and I exerted it to the utmost Every few moments I could hear the yelpings of the dogs They were gaining upon me Every howl was nearer and nearer Each moment I expected they would spring upon my back expected to feel their long teeth sinking into my flesh There were so many of them I knew they would tear me to pieces that they would worry me at once to death I gasped for breath gasped forth a half uttered choking prayer to the Almighty to save me to give me strength to reach some wide deep bayou where I could throw them off the track or sink into its waters Presently I reached a thick palmetto bottom As I fled through them they made a loud rustling noise not loud enough however to drown the voices of the dogs Continuing my course due south as nearly as I can judge I came at length to water just over shoe The hounds at that moment could not have been five rods behind me I could hear them crashing and plunging through the palmettoes their loud eager yells making the whole swamp clamorous with the sound Hope revived a little as I reached the water If it were only deeper they might loose the scent and thus disconcerted afford me the opportunity of evading them Luckily it grew deeper the farther I proceeded now over my ankles now half way to my knees now sinking a moment to my waist and then emerging presently into more shallow places The dogs had not gained upon me since I struck the water Evidently they were confused Now their savage intonations grew more and more distant assuring me that I was leaving them Finally I stopped to listen but the long howl came booming on the air again telling me I was not yet safe From bog to bog where I had stepped they could still keep upon the track though impeded by the water At length to my great joy I came to a wide bayou and plunging in had soon stemmed its sluggish current to the other side There certainly the dogs would be confounded the current carrying down the stream all traces of that slight mysterious scent which enables the quick smelling hound to follow in the track of the fugitive After crossing this bayou the water became so deep I could not run I was now in what I afterwards learned was the Great Pacoudrie Swamp It was filled with immense trees the sycamore the gum the cotton wood and cypress and extends I am informed to the shore of the Calcasieu river For thirty or forty miles it is without inhabitants save wild beasts the bear the wild cat the tiger and great slimy reptiles that are crawling through it everywhere Long before I reached the bayou in fact from the time I struck the water until I emerged from the swamp on my return these reptiles surrounded me I saw hundreds of moccasin snakes Every log and bog every trunk of a fallen tree over which I was compelled to step or climb was alive with them They crawled away at my approach but sometimes in my haste I almost placed my hand or foot upon them They are poisonous serpents their bite more fatal than the rattlesnake's Besides I had lost one shoe the sole having come entirely off leaving the upper only dangling to my ankle I saw also many alligators great and small lying in the water or on pieces of floodwood The noise I made usually startled them when they moved off and plunged into the deepest places Sometimes however I would come directly upon a monster before observing it In such cases I would start back run a short way round and in that manner shun them Straight forward they will run a short distance rapidly but do not possess the power of turning In a crooked race there is no difficulty in evading them About two o'clock in the afternoon I heard the last of the hounds Probably they did not cross the bayou Wet and weary but relieved from the sense of instant peril I continued on more cautious and afraid however of the snakes and alligators than I had been in the earlier portion of my flight Now before stepping into a muddy pool I would strike the water with a stick If the waters moved I would go around it if not would venture through At length the sun went down and gradually night's trailing mantle shrouded the great swamp in darkness Still I staggered on fearing every instant I should feel the dreadful sting of the moccasin or be crushed within the jaws of some disturbed alligator The dread of them now almost equaled the fear of the pursuing hounds The moon arose after a time its mild light creeping through the overspreading branches loaded with long pendent moss I kept traveling forwards until after midnight hoping all the while that I would soon emerge into some less desolate and dangerous region But the water grew deeper and the walking more difficult than ever I perceived it would be impossible to proceed much farther and knew not moreover what hands I might fall into should I succeed in reaching a human habitation Not provided with a pass any white man would be at liberty to arrest me and place me in prison until such time as my master should prove property pay charges and take me away I was an estray and if so unfortunate as to meet a law abiding citizen of Louisiana he would deem it his duty to his neighbor perhaps to put me forthwith in the pound Really it was difficult to determine which I had most reason to fear dogs alligators or men After midnight however I came to a halt Imagination cannot picture the dreariness of the scene The swamp was resonant with the quacking of innumerable ducks Since the foundation of the earth in all probability a human footstep had never before so far penetrated the recesses of the swamp It was not silent now silent to a degree that rendered it oppressive as it was when the sun was shining in the heavens My midnight intrusion had awakened the feathered tribes which seemed to throng the morass in hundreds of thousands and their garrulous throats poured forth such multitudinous sounds there was such a fluttering of wings such sullen plunges in the water all around me that I was affrighted and appalled All the fowls of the air and all the creeping things of the earth appeared to have assembled together in that particular place for the purpose of filling it with clamor and confusion Not by human dwellings not in crowded cities alone are the sights and sounds of life The wildest places of the earth are full of them Even in the heart of that dismal swamp God had provided a refuge and a dwelling place for millions of living things The moon had now risen above the trees when I resolved upon a new project Thus far I had endeavored to travel as nearly south as possible Turning about I proceeded in a north west direction my object being to strike the Pine Woods in the vicinity of Master Ford's Once within the shadow of his protection I felt I would be comparatively safe My clothes were in tatters my hands face and body covered with scratches received from the sharp knots of fallen trees and in climbing over piles of brush and floodwood My bare foot was full of thorns I was besmeared with muck and mud and the green slime that had collected on the surface of the dead water in which I had been immersed to the neck many times during the day and night Hour after hour and tiresome indeed had they become I continued to plod along on my north west course The water began to grow less deep and the ground more firm under my feet At last I reached the Pacoudrie the same wide bayou I had swam while outward bound I swam it again and shortly after thought I heard a cock crow but the sound was faint and it might have been a mockery of the ear The water receded from my advancing footsteps now I had left the bogs behind me now now I was on dry land that gradually ascended to the plain and I knew I was somewhere in the Great Pine Woods Just at day break I came to an opening a sort of small plantation but one I had never seen before In the edge of the woods I came upon two men a slave and his young master engaged in catching wild hogs The white man I knew would demand my pass and not able to give him one would take me into possession I was too wearied to run again and too desperate to be taken and therefore adopted a ruse that proved entirely successful Assuming a fierce expression I walked directly towards him looking him steadily in the face As I approached he moved backwards with an air of alarm It was plain he was much affrighted that he looked upon me as some infernal goblin just arisen from the bowels of the swamp Where does William Ford live I demanded in no gentle tone He lives seven miles from here was the reply Which is the way to his place I again demanded trying to look more fiercely than ever Do you see those pine trees yonder he asked pointing to two a mile distant that rose far above their fellows like a couple of tall sentinels overlooking the broad expanse of forest I see them was the answer At the feet of those pine trees he continued runs the Texas road Turn to the left and it will lead you to William Ford's Without further parley I hastened forward happy as he was no doubt to place the widest possible distance between us Striking the Texas road I turned to the left hand as directed and soon passed a great fire where a pile of logs were burning I went to it thinking I would dry my clothes but the gray light of the morning was fast breaking away some passing white man might observe me besides the heat overpowered me with the desire of sleep so lingering no longer I continued my travels and finally about eight o'clock reached the house of Master Ford The slaves were all absent from the quarters at their work Stepping on to the piazza I knocked at the door which was soon opened by Mistress Ford My appearance was so changed I was in such a wobegone and forlorn condition she did not know me Inquiring if Master Ford was at home that good man made his appearance before the question could be answered I told him of my flight and all the particulars connected with it He listened attentively and when I had concluded spoke to me kindly and sympathetically and taking me to the kitchen called John and ordered him to prepare me food I had tasted nothing since daylight the previous morning When John had set the meal before me the madam came out with a bowl of milk and many little delicious dainties such as rarely please the palate of a slave I was hungry and I was weary but neither food nor rest afforded half the pleasure as did the blessed voices speaking kindness and consolation It was the oil and the wine which the Good Samaritan in the Great Pine Woods was ready to pour into the wounded spirit of the slave who came to him stripped of his raiment and half dead They left me in the cabin that I might rest Blessed be sleep It visiteth all alike descending as the dews of heaven on the bond and free Soon it nestled to my bosom driving away the troubles that oppressed it and bearing me to that shadowy region where I saw again the faces and listened to the voices of my children who alas for aught I knew in my waking hours had fallen into the arms of that other sleep from which they never would arouse XI THE MISTRESS' GARDEN THE CRIMSON AND GOLDEN FRUIT ORANGE AND POMEGRANATE TREES RETURN TO BAYOU BOEUF MASTER FORD'S REMARKS ON THE WAY THE MEETING WITH TIBEATS HIS ACCOUNT OF THE CHASE FORD CENSURE HIS BRUTALITY ARRIVAL AT THE PLANTATION ASTONISHMENT OF THE

BLACK WOMEN IN THE BIG CANE LUMBER WOMEN SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF TIBEATS HIS PROVOKING TREATMENT VISIT TO BAYOU BOEUF THE SLAVE PASS SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY THE LAST OF ELIZA SALE TO EDWIN EPPS AFTER a long sleep sometime in the afternoon I awoke refreshed but very sore and stiff Sally came in and talked with me while John cooked me some dinner Sally was in great trouble as well as myself one of her children being ill and she feared it could not survive Dinner over after walking about the quarters for a while visiting Sally's cabin and looking at the sick child I strolled into the madam's garden Though it was a season of the year when the voices of the birds are silent and the trees are stripped of their summer glories in more frigid climes yet the whole variety of roses were then blooming there and the long luxuriant vines creeping over the frames The crimson and golden fruit hung half hidden amidst the younger and older blossoms of the peach the orange the plum and the pomegranate for in that region of almost perpetual warmth the leaves are falling and the buds bursting into bloom the whole year long I indulged the most grateful feelings towards Master and Mistress Ford and wishing in some manner to repay their kindness commenced trimming the vines and afterwards weeding out the grass from among the orange and pomegranate trees The latter grows eight or ten feet high and its fruit though larger is similar in appearance to the jelly flower It has the luscious flavor of the strawberry Oranges peaches plums and most other fruits are indigenous to the rich warm soil of Avoyelles but the apple the most common of them all in colder latitudes is rarely to be seen Mistress Ford came out presently saying it was praise worthy in me but I was not in a condition to labor and might rest myself at the quarters until master should go down to Bayou Boeuf which would not be that day and it might not be the next I said to her to be sure I felt bad and was stiff and that my foot pained me the stubs and thorns having so torn it but thought such exercise would not hurt me and that it was a great pleasure to work for so good a mistress Thereupon she returned to the great house and for three days I was diligent in the garden cleaning the walks weeding the flower beds and pulling up the rank grass beneath the jessamine vines which the gentle and generous hand of my protectress had taught to clamber along the walls The fourth morning having become recruited and refreshed Master Ford ordered me to make ready to accompany him to the bayou There was but one saddle horse at the opening all the others with the mules having been sent down to the plantation I said I could walk and bidding Sally and John good bye left the opening trotting along by the horse's side That little paradise in the Great Pine Woods was the oasis in the desert towards which my heart turned lovingly during many years of bondage I went forth from it now with regret and sorrow not so overwhelming however as if it had then been given me to know that I should never return to it again Master Ford urged me to take his place occasionally on the horse to rest me but I said no I was not tired and it was better for me to walk than him He said many kind and cheering things to me on the way riding slowly in order that I might keep pace with him The goodness of God was manifest he declared in my miraculous escape from the swamp As Daniel came forth unharmed from the den of lions and as Jonah had been preserved in the whale's belly even so had I been delivered from evil by the Almighty He interrogated me in regard to the various fears and emotions I had experienced during the day and night and if I had felt at any time a desire to pray I felt forsaken of the whole world I answered him and was praying mentally all the while At such times said he the heart of man turns instinctively towards his Maker In prosperity and when there is nothing to injure or make him afraid he remembers Him not and is ready to defy Him but place him in the midst of dangers cut him off from human aid let the grave open before him then it is in the time of his tribulation that the scoffer and unbelieving man turns to God for help feeling there is no other hope or refuge or safety save in his protecting arm So did that benignant man speak to me of this life and of the life hereafter of the goodness and power of God and of the vanity of earthly things as we journeyed along the solitary road towards Bayou Boeuf When within some five miles of the plantation we discovered a horseman at a distance galloping towards us As he came near I saw that it was Tibeats He looked at me a moment but did not address me and turning about rode along side by side with Ford I trotted silently at their horses' heels listing to their conversation Ford informed him of my arrival in the Pine Woods three days before of the sad plight I was in and of the difficulties and dangers I had encountered Well exclaimed Tibeats omitting his usual oaths in the presence of Ford I never saw such running before I'll bet him against a hundred dollars he'll beat any nigger in Louisiana I offered John David Cheney twenty five dollars to catch him dead or alive but he outran his dogs in a fair race Them Cheney dogs ain't much after all Dunwoodie's hounds would have had him down before he touched the palmettoes Somehow the dogs got off the track and we had to give up the hunt We rode the horses as far as we could and then kept on foot till the water was three feet deep The boys said he was drowned sure I allow I wanted a shot at him mightily Ever since I have been riding up and down the bayou but had'nt much hope of catching him thought he was dead sartin Oh he's a cuss to run that nigger is In this way Tibeats ran on describing his search in the swamp the wonderful speed with which I had fled before the hounds and when he had finished Master Ford responded by saying I had always been a willing and faithful boy with him that he was sorry we had such trouble that according to Platt's story he had been inhumanly treated and that he Tibeats was himself in fault Using hatchets and broad axes upon slaves was shameful and should not be allowed he remarked This is no way of dealing with them when first brought into the country It will have a pernicious influence and set them all running away The swamps will be full of them A little kindness would be far more effectual in restraining them and rendering them obedient than the use of such deadly weapons Every planter on the bayou should frown upon such inhumanity It is for the interest of all to do so It is evident enough Mr Tibeats that you and Platt cannot live together You dislike him and would not hesitate to kill him and knowing it he will run from you again through fear of his life Now Tibeats you must sell him or hire him out at least Unless you do so I shall take measures to get him out of your possession In this spirit Ford addressed him the remainder of the distance I opened not my mouth On reaching the plantation they entered the great house while I repaired to Eliza's cabin The slaves were astonished to find me there on returning from the field supposing I was drowned That night again they gathered about the cabin to listen to the story of my adventure They took it for granted I would be whipped and that it would be severe the well known penalty of running away being five hundred lashes Poor fellow said Eliza taking me by the hand it would have been better for you if you had drowned You have a cruel master and he will kill you yet I am afraid Lawson suggested that it might be overseer Chapin would be appointed to inflict the punishment in which case it would not be severe whereupon Mary Rachel Bristol and others hoped it would be Master Ford and then it would be no whipping at all They all pitied me and tried to console me and were sad in view of the castigation that awaited me except Kentucky John There were no bounds to his laughter he filled the cabin with cachinnations holding his sides to prevent an explosion and the cause of his noisy mirth was the idea of my outstripping the hounds Somehow he looked at the subject in a comical light I know'd dey would'nt cotch him when he run cross de plantation O de lor' did'nt Platt pick his feet right up tho' hey When dem dogs got whar he was he was'nt dar haw haw haw O de lor' a' mity and then Kentucky John relapsed into another of his boisterous fits Early the next morning Tibeats left the plantation In the course of the forenoon while sauntering about the gin house a tall good looking man came to me and inquired if I was Tibeats' boy that youthful appellation being applied indiscriminately to slaves even though they may have passed the number of three score years and ten I took off my hat and answered that I was How would you like to work for me he inquired Oh I would like to very much said I inspired with a sudden hope of getting away from Tibeats You worked under Myers at Peter Tanner's didn't you I replied I had adding some complimentary remarks that Myers had made concerning me Well boy said he I have hired you of your master to work for me in the Big Cane Brake thirty eight miles from here down on Red River This man was Mr Eldret who lived below Ford's on the same side of the bayou I accompanied him to his plantation and in the morning started with his slave Sam and a wagon load of provisions drawn by four mules for the Big Cane Eldret and Myers having preceded us on horseback This Sam was a native of Charleston where he had a mother brother and sisters He allowed a common word among both black and white that Tibeats was a mean man and hoped as I most earnestly did also that his master would buy me We proceeded down the south shore of the bayou crossing it at Carey's plantation from thence to Huff Power passing which we came upon the Bayou Rouge road which runs towards Red River After passing through Bayou Rouge Swamp and just at sunset turning from the highway we struck off into the Big Cane Brake We followed an unbeaten track scarcely wide enough to admit the wagon The cane such as are used for fishing rods were as thick as they could stand A person could not be seen through them the distance of a rod The paths of wild beasts run through them in various directions the bear and the American tiger abounding in these brakes and wherever there is a basin of stagnant water it is full of alligators We kept on our lonely course through the Big Cane several miles when we entered a clearing known as Sutton's Field Many years before a man by the name of Sutton had penetrated the wilderness of cane to this solitary place Tradition has it that he fled thither a fugitive not from service but from justice Here he lived alone recluse and hermit of the swamp with his own hands planting the seed and gathering in the harvest One day a band of Indians stole upon his solitude and after a bloody battle overpowered and massacred him For miles the country round in the slaves' quarters and on the piazzas of great houses where white children listen to superstitious tales the story goes that that spot in the heart of the Big Cane is a haunted place For more than a quarter of a century human voices had rarely if ever disturbed the silence of the clearing Rank and noxious weeds had overspread the once cultivated field serpents sunned themselves on the doorway of the crumbling cabin It was indeed a dreary picture of desolation Passing Sutton's Field we followed a new cut road two miles farther which brought us to its termination We had now reached the wild lands of Mr Eldret where he contemplated clearing up an extensive plantation We went to work next morning with our cane knives and cleared a sufficient space to allow the erection of two cabins one for Myers and Eldret the other for Sam myself and the slaves that were to join us We were now in the midst of trees of enormous growth whose wide spreading branches almost shut out the light of the sun while the space between the trunks was an impervious mass of cane with here and there an occasional palmetto The bay and the sycamore the oak and the cypress reach a growth unparalleled in those fertile lowlands bordering the Red River From every tree moreover hang long large masses of moss presenting to the eye unaccustomed to them a striking and singular appearance This moss in large quantities is sent north and there used for manufacturing purposes We cut down oaks split them into rails and with these erected temporary cabins We covered the roofs with the broad palmetto leaf an excellent substitute for shingles as long as they last The greatest annoyance I met with here were small flies gnats and mosquitoes They swarmed the air They penetrated the porches of the ear the nose the eyes the mouth They sucked themselves beneath the skin It was impossible to brush or beat them off It seemed indeed as if they would devour us carry us away piecemeal in their small tormenting mouths A lonelier spot or one more disagreeable than the centre of the Big Cane Brake it would be difficult to conceive yet to me it was a paradise in comparison with any other place in the company of Master Tibeats I labored hard and oft times was weary and fatigued yet I could lie down at night in peace and arise in the morning without fear In the course of a fortnight four black girls came down from Eldret's plantation Charlotte Fanny Cresia and Nelly They were all large and stout Axes were put into their hands and they were sent out with Sam and myself to cut trees They were excellent choppers the largest oak or sycamore standing but a brief season before their heavy and well directed blows At piling logs they were equal to any man There are lumberwomen as well as lumbermen in the forests of the South In fact in the region of the Bayou Boeuf they perform their share of all the labor required on the plantation They plough drag drive team clear wild lands work on the highway and so forth Some planters owning large cotton and sugar plantations have none other than the labor of slave women Such an one is Jim Burns who lives on the north shore of the bayou opposite the plantation of John Fogaman On our arrival in the brake Eldret promised me if I worked well I might go up to visit my friends at Ford's in four weeks On Saturday night of the fifth week I reminded him of his promise when he told me I had done so well that I might go I had set my heart upon it and Eldret's announcement thrilled me with pleasure I was to return in time to commence the labors of the day on Tuesday morning While indulging the pleasant anticipation of so soon meeting my old friends again suddenly the hateful form of Tibeats appeared among us He inquired how Myers and Platt got along together and was told very well and that Platt was going up to Ford's plantation in the morning on a visit Poh poh sneered Tibeats it isn't worth while the nigger will get unsteady He can't go But Eldret insisted I had worked faithfully that he had given me his promise and that under the circumstances I ought not to be disappointed They then it being about dark entered one cabin and I the other I could not give up the idea of going it was a sore disappointment Before morning I resolved if Eldret made no objection to leave at all hazards At daylight I was at his door with my blanket rolled up into a bundle and hanging on a stick over my shoulder waiting for a pass Tibeats came out presently in one of his disagreeable moods washed his face and going to a stump near by sat down upon it apparently busily thinking with himself After standing there a long time impelled by a sudden impulse of impatience I started off Are you going without a pass he cried out to me Yes master I thought I would I answered How do you think you'll get there demanded he Don't know was all the reply I made him You'd be taken and sent to jail where you ought to be before you got half way there he added passing into the cabin as he said it He came out soon with the pass in his hand and calling me a d d nigger that deserved a hundred lashes threw it on the ground I picked it up and hurried away right speedily A slave caught off his master's plantation without a pass may be seized and whipped by any white man whom he meets The one I now received was dated and read as follows Platt has permission to go to Ford's plantation on Bayou Boeuf and return by Tuesday morning JOHN M TIBEATS This is the usual form On the way a great many demanded it read it and passed on Those having the air and appearance of gentlemen whose dress indicated the possession of wealth frequently took no notice of me whatever but a shabby fellow an unmistakable loafer never failed to hail me and to scrutinize and examine me in the most thorough manner Catching runaways is sometimes a money making business If after advertising no owner appears they may be sold to the highest bidder and certain fees are allowed the finder for his services at all events even if reclaimed A mean white therefore a name applied to the species loafer considers it a god send to meet an unknown negro without a pass There are no inns along the highways in that portion of the State where I sojourned I was wholly destitute of money neither did I carry any provisions on my journey from the Big Cane to Bayou Boeuf nevertheless with his pass in his hand a slave need never suffer from hunger or from thirst It is only necessary to present it to the master or overseer of a plantation and state his wants when he will be sent round to the kitchen and provided with food or shelter as the case may require The traveler stops at any house and calls for a meal with as much freedom as if it was a public tavern It is the general custom of the country Whatever their faults may be it is certain the inhabitants along Red River and around the bayous in the interior of Louisiana are not wanting in hospitality I arrived at Ford's plantation towards the close of the afternoon passing the evening in Eliza's cabin with Lawson Rachel and others of my acquaintance When we left Washington Eliza's form was round and plump She stood erect and in her silks and jewels presented a picture of graceful strength and elegance Now she was but a thin shadow of her former self Her face had become ghastly haggard and the once straight and active form was bowed down as if bearing the weight of a hundred years Crouching on her cabin floor and clad in the coarse garments of a slave old Elisha Berry would not have recognized the mother of his child I never saw her afterwards Having become useless in the cotton field she was bartered for a trifle to some man residing in the vicinity of Peter Compton's Grief had gnawed remorselessly at her heart until her strength was gone and for that her last master it is said lashed and abused her most unmercifully But he could not whip back the departed vigor of her youth nor straighten up that bended body to its full height such as it was when her children were around her and the light of freedom was shining on her path I learned the particulars relative to her departure from this world from some of Compton's slaves who had come over Red River to the bayou to assist young Madam Tanner during the busy season She became at length they said utterly helpless for several weeks lying on the ground floor in a dilapidated cabin dependent upon the mercy of her fellowthralls for an occasional drop of water and a morsel of food Her master did not knock her on the head as is sometimes done to put a suffering animal out of misery but left her unprovided for and unprotected to linger through a life of pain and wretchedness to its natural close When the hands returned from the field one night they found her dead During the day the Angel of the Lord who moveth invisibly over all the earth gathering in his harvest of departing souls had silently entered the cabin of the dying woman and taken her from thence She was free at last Next day rolling up my blanket I started on my return to the Big Cane After traveling five miles at a place called Huff Power the ever present Tibeats met me in the road He inquired why I was going back so soon and when informed I was anxious to return by the time I was directed he said I need go no farther than the next plantation as he had that day sold me to Edwin Epps We walked down into the yard where we met the latter gentleman who examined me and asked me the usual questions propounded by purchasers Having been duly delivered over I was ordered to the quarters and at the same time directed to make a hoe and axe handle for myself I was now no longer the property of Tibeats his dog his brute dreading his wrath and cruelty day and night and whoever or whatever my new master might prove to be I could not certainly regret the change So it was good news when the sale was announced and with a sigh of relief I sat down for the first time in my new abode Tibeats soon after disappeared from that section of the country Once afterwards and only once I caught a glimpse of him It was many miles from Bayou Boeuf He was seated in the doorway of a low groggery I was passing in a drove of slaves through St Mary's parish XII PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF EPPS

EPPS of whom much will be said during the remainder of this history is a large portly heavybodied man with light hair high cheek bones and a Roman nose of extraordinary dimensions He has blue eyes a fair complexion and is as I should say full six feet high He has the sharp inquisitive expression of a jockey His manners are repulsive and coarse and his language gives speedy and unequivocal evidence that he has never enjoyed the advantages of an education He has the faculty of saying most provoking things in that respect even excelling old Peter Tanner At the time I came into his possession Edwin Epps was fond of the bottle his sprees sometimes extending over the space of two whole weeks Latterly however he had reformed his habits and when I left him was as strict a specimen of temperance as could be found on Bayou Boeuf When in his Cups Master Epps was a roystering blustering noisy fellow whose chief delight was in dancing with his niggers or lashing them about the yard with his long whip just for the pleasure of hearing them screech and scream as the great welts were planted on their backs When sober he was silent reserved and cunning not beating us indiscriminately as in his drunken moments but sending the end of his rawhide to some tender spot of a lagging slave with a sly dexterity peculiar to himself He had been a driver and overseer in his younger years but at this time was in possession of a plantation on Bayou Huff Power two and a half miles from Holmesville eighteen from Marksville and twelve from Cheneyville It belonged to Joseph B Roberts his wife's uncle and was leased by Epps His principal business was raising cotton and inasmuch as some may read this book who have never seen a cotton field a description of the manner of its culture may not be out of place The ground is prepared by throwing up beds or ridges with the plough back furrowing it is called Oxen and mules the latter almost exclusively are used in ploughing The women as frequently as the men perform this labor feeding currying and taking care of their teams and in all respects doing the field and stable work precisely as do the ploughboys of the North The beds or ridges are six feet wide that is from water furrow to water furrow A plough drawn by one mule is then run along the top of the ridge or center of the bed making the drill into which a girl usually drops the seed which she carries in a bag hung round her neck Behind her comes a mule and harrow covering up the seed so that two mules three slaves a plough and harrow are employed in planting a row of cotton This is done in the months of March and April Corn is planted in February When there are no cold rains the cotton usually makes its appearance in a week In the course of eight or ten days afterwards the first hoeing is commenced This is performed in part also by the aid of the plough and mule The plough passes as near as possible to the cotton on both sides throwing the furrow from it Slaves follow with their hoes cutting up the grass and cotton leaving hills two feet and a half apart This is called scraping cotton In two weeks more commences the second hoeing This time the furrow is thrown towards the cotton Only one stalk the largest is now left standing in each hill In another fortnight it is hoed the third time throwing the furrow towards the cotton in the same manner as before and killing all the grass between the rows About the first of July when it is a foot high or thereabouts it is hoed the fourth and last time Now the whole space between the rows is ploughed leaving a deep water furrow in the center During all these hoeings the overseer or driver follows the slaves on horseback with a whip such as has been described The fastest hoer takes the lead row He is usually about a rod in advance of his companions If one of them passes him he is whipped If one falls behind or is a moment idle he is whipped In fact the lash is flying from morning until night the whole day long The hoeing season thus continues from April until July a field having no sooner been finished once than it is commenced again In the latter part of August begins the cotton picking season At this time each slave is presented with a sack A strap is fastened to it which goes over the neck holding the mouth of the sack breast high while the bottom reaches nearly to the ground Each one is also presented with a large basket that will hold about two barrels This is to put the cotton in when the sack is filled The baskets are carried to the field and placed at the beginning of the rows When a new hand one unaccustomed to the business is sent for the first time into the field he is whipped up smartly and made for that day to pick as fast as he can possibly At night it is weighed so that his capability in cotton picking is known He must bring in the same weight each night following If it falls short it is considered evidence that he has been laggard and a greater or less number of lashes is the penalty An ordinary day's work is two hundred pounds A slave who is accustomed to picking is punished if he or she brings in a less quantity than that There is a great difference among them as regards this kind of labor Some of them seem to have a natural knack or quickness which enables them to pick with great celerity and with both hands while others with whatever practice or industry are utterly unable to come up to the ordinary standard Such hands are taken from the cotton field and employed in other business Patsey of whom I shall have more to say was known as the most remarkable cotton picker on Bayou Boeuf She picked with both hands and with such surprising rapidity that five hundred pounds a day was not unusual for her Each one is tasked therefore according to his picking abilities none however to come short of two hundred weight I being unskillful always in that business would have satisfied my master by bringing in the latter quantity while on the other hand Patsey would surely have been beaten if she failed to produce twice as much The cotton grows from five to seven feet high each stalk having a great many branches shooting out in all directions and lapping each other above the water furrow There are few sights more pleasant to the eye than a wide cotton field when it is in the bloom It presents an appearance of purity like an immaculate expanse of light new fallen snow Sometimes the slave picks down one side of a row and back upon the other but more usually there is one on either side gathering all that has blossomed leaving the unopened boils for a succeeding picking When the sack is filled it is emptied into the basket and trodden down It is necessary to be extremely careful the first time going through the field in order not to break the branches off the stalks The cotton will not bloom upon a broken branch Epps never failed to inflict the severest chastisement on the unlucky servant who either carelessly or unavoidably was guilty in the least degree in this respect The hands are required to be in the cotton field as soon as it is light in the morning and with the exception of ten or fifteen minutes which is given them at noon to swallow their allowance of cold bacon they are not permitted to be a moment idle until it is too dark to see and when the moon is full they often times labor till the middle of the night They do not dare to stop even at dinner time nor return to the quarters however late it be until the order to halt is given by the driver The day's work over in the field the baskets are toted or in other words carried to the gin house where the cotton is weighed No matter how fatigued and weary he may be no matter how much he longs for sleep and rest a slave never approaches the gin house with his basket of cotton but with fear If it falls short in weight if he has not performed the full task appointed him he knows that he must suffer And if he has exceeded it by ten or twenty pounds in all probability his master will measure the next day's task accordingly So whether he has too little or too much his approach to the gin house is always with fear and trembling Most frequently they have too little and therefore it is they are not anxious to leave the field After weighing follow the whippings and then the baskets are carried to the cotton house and their contents stored away like hay all hands being sent in to tramp it down If the cotton is not dry instead of taking it to the gin house at once it is laid upon platforms two feet high and some three times as wide covered with boards or plank with narrow walks running between them This done the labor of the day is not yet ended by any means Each one must then attend to his respective chores One feeds the mules another the swine another cuts the wood and so forth besides the packing is all done by candle light Finally at a late hour they reach the quarters sleepy and overcome with the long day's toil Then a fire must be kindled in the cabin the corn ground in the small hand mill and supper and dinner for the next day in the field prepared All that is allowed them is corn and bacon which is given out at the corncrib and smoke house every Sunday morning Each one receives as his weekly allowance three and a half pounds of bacon and corn enough to make a peck of meal That is all no tea coffee sugar and with the exception of a very scanty sprinkling now and then no salt I can say from a ten years' residence with Master Epps that no slave of his is ever likely to suffer from the gout superinduced by excessive high living Master Epps' hogs were fed on shelled corn it was thrown out to his niggers in the ear The former he thought would fatten faster by shelling and soaking it in the water the latter perhaps if treated in the same manner might grow too fat to labor Master Epps was a shrewd calculator and knew how to manage his own animals drunk or sober The corn mill stands in the yard beneath a shelter It is like a common coffee mill the hopper holding about six quarts There was one privilege which Master Epps granted freely to every slave he had They might grind their corn nightly in such small quantities as their daily wants required or they might grind the whole week's allowance at one time on Sundays just as they preferred A very generous man was Master Epps I kept my corn in a small wooden box the meal in a gourd and by the way the gourd is one of the most convenient and necessary utensils on a plantation Besides supplying the place of all kinds of crockery in a slave cabin it is used for carrying water to the fields Another also contains the dinner It dispenses with the necessity of pails dippers basins and such tin and wooden superfluities altogether When the corn is ground and fire is made the bacon is taken down from the nail on which it hangs a slice cut off and thrown upon the coals to broil The majority of slaves have no knife much less a fork They cut their bacon with the axe at the woodpile The corn meal is mixed with a little water placed in the fire and baked When it is done brown the ashes are scraped off and being placed upon a chip which answers for a table the tenant of the slave hut is ready to sit down upon the ground to supper By this time it is usually midnight The same fear of punishment with which they approach the gin house possesses them again on lying down to get a snatch of rest It is the fear of oversleeping in the morning Such an offence would certainly be attended with not less than twenty lashes With a prayer that he may be on his feet and wide awake at the first sound of the horn he sinks to his slumbers nightly The softest couches in the world are not to be found in the log mansion of the slave The one whereon I reclined year after year was a plank twelve inches wide and ten feet long My pillow was a stick of wood The bedding was a coarse blanket and not a rag or shred beside Moss might be used were it not that it directly breeds a swarm of fleas The cabin is constructed of logs without floor or window The latter is altogether unnecessary the crevices between the logs admitting sufficient light In stormy weather the rain drives through them rendering it comfortless and extremely disagreeable The rude door hangs on great wooden hinges In one end is constructed an awkward fire place An hour before day light the horn is blown Then the slaves arouse prepare their breakfast fill a gourd with water in another deposit their dinner of cold bacon and corn cake and hurry to the field again It is an offence invariably followed by a flogging to be found at the quarters after daybreak Then the fears and labors of another day begin and until its close there is no such thing as rest He fears he will be caught lagging through the day he fears to approach the gin house with his basket load of cotton at night he fears when he lies down that he will oversleep himself in the morning Such is a true faithful unexaggerated picture and description of the slave's daily life during the time of cotton picking on the shores of Bayou Boeuf In the month of January generally the fourth and last picking is completed Then commences the harvesting of corn This is considered a secondary crop and receives far less attention than the cotton It is planted as already mentioned in February Corn is grown in that region for the purpose of fattening hogs and feeding slaves very little if any being sent to market It is the white variety the ear of great size and the stalk growing to the height of eight and often times ten feet In August the leaves are stripped off dried in the sun bound in small bundles and stored away as provender for the mules and oxen After this the slaves go through the field turning down the ear for the purpose of keeping the rains from penetrating to the grain It is left in this condition until after cotton picking is over whether earlier or later Then the ears are separated from the stalks and deposited in the corncrib with the husks on otherwise stripped of the husks the weevil would destroy it The stalks are left standing in the field The Carolina or sweet potato is also grown in that region to some extent They are not fed however to hogs or cattle and are considered but of small importance They are preserved by placing them upon the surface of the ground with a slight covering of earth or cornstalks There is not a cellar on Bayou Boeuf The ground is so low it would fill with water Potatoes are worth from two to three bits or shillings a barrel corn except when there is an unusual scarcity can be purchased at the same rate As soon as the cotton and corn crops are secured the stalks are pulled up thrown into piles and burned The ploughs are started at the same time throwing up the beds again preparatory to another planting The soil in the parishes of Rapides and Avoyelles and throughout the whole country so far as my observation extended is of exceeding richness and fertility It is a kind of marl of a brown or reddish color It does not require those invigorating composts necessary to more barren lands and on the same field the same crop is grown for many successive years Ploughing planting picking cotton gathering the corn and pulling and burning stalks occupies the whole of the four seasons of the year Drawing and cutting wood pressing cotton fattening and killing hog's are but incidental labors In the month of September or October the hogs are run out of the swamps by dogs and confined in pens On a cold morning generally about New Year's day they are slaughtered Each carcass is cut into six parts and piled one above the other in salt upon large tables in the smoke house In this condition it remains a fortnight when it is hung up and a fire built and continued more than half the time during the remainder of the year This thorough smoking is necessary to prevent the bacon from becoming infested with worms In so warm a climate it is difficult to preserve it and very many times myself and my companions have received our weekly allowance of three pounds and a half when it was full of these disgusting vermin Although the swamps are overrun with cattle they are never made the source of profit to any considerable extent The planter cuts his mark upon the ear or brands his initials upon the side and turns them into the swamps to roam unrestricted within their almost limitless confines They are the Spanish breed small and spike horned I have known of droves being taken from Bayou Boeuf but it is of very rare occurrence The value of the best cows is about five dollars each Two quarts at one milking would be considered an unusual large quantity They furnish little tallow and that of a soft inferior quality Notwithstanding the great number of cows that throng the swamps the planters are indebted to the North for their cheese and butter which is purchased in the New Orleans market Salted beef is not an article of food either in the great house or in the cabin Master Epps was accustomed to attend shooting matches for the purpose of obtaining what fresh beef he required These sports occurred weekly at the neighboring village of Holmesville Fat beeves are driven thither and shot at a stipulated price being demanded for the privilege The lucky marksman divides the flesh among his fellows and in this manner the attending planters are supplied The great number of tame and untamed cattle which swarm the woods and swamps of Bayou Boeuf most probably suggested that appellation to the French inasmuch as the term translated signifies the creek or river of the wild ox Garden products such as cabbages turnips and the like are cultivated for the use of the master and his family They have greens and vegetables at all times and seasons of the year The grass withereth and the flower fadeth before the desolating winds of autumn in the chill northern latitudes but perpetual verdure overspreads the hot lowlands and flowers bloom in the heart of winter in the region of Bayou Boeuf There are no meadows appropriated to the cultivation of the grasses The leaves of the corn supply a sufficiency of food for the laboring cattle while the rest provide for themselves all the year in the evergrowing pasture There are many other peculiarities of climate habit custom and of the manner of living and laboring at the South but the foregoing it is supposed will give the reader an insight and general idea of life on a cotton plantation in Louisiana The mode of cultivating cane and the process of sugar manufacturing will be mentioned in another place XIII THE CURIOUS AXE HELVE SYMPTOMS OF APPROACHING ILLNESS CONTINUE TO DECLINE THE WHIP INEFFECTUAL CONFINED TO THE CABIN VISIT BY DR WINES ART PARTIAL RECOVERY FAILURE AT COTTON PICKING WHAT MAY BE HEARD ON EPPS' PLANTATION LASHES GRADUATED EPPS IN A WHIPPING MOOD EPPS IN A DANCING MOOD DESCRIPTION OF THE DANCE LOSS OF REST NO EXCUSE EPPS' CHARACTERISTICS JIM BURNS REMOVAL FROM HUFF POWER TO BAYOU BOEUF DESCRIPTION OF UNCLE ABRAM OF WILEY OF AUNT PHEBE OF BOB HENRY AND EDWARD OF PETSEY WITH A GENEALOGICAL ACCOUNT OF EACH SOMETHING OF THEIR PAST HISTORY AND PECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS JEALOUSY AND LUST PATSEY THE VICTIM On my arrival at Master Epps' in obedience to his order the first business upon which I entered was the making of an axe halve The handles in use there are simply a round straight stick I made a crooked one shaped like those to which I had been accustomed at the North When finished and presented to Epps he looked at it with astonishment unable to determine exactly what it was He had never before seen such a handle and when I explained its conveniences he was forcibly struck with the novelty of the idea He kept it in the house a long time and when his friends called was wont to exhibit it as a curiosity It was now the season of hoeing I was first sent into the corn field and afterwards set to scraping cotton In this employment I remained until hoeing time was nearly passed when I began to experience the symptoms of approaching illness I was attacked with chills which were succeeded by a burning fever I became weak and emaciated and frequently so dizzy that it caused me to reel and stagger like a drunken man Nevertheless I was compelled to keep up my row When in health I found little difficulty in keeping pace with my fellow laborers but now it seemed to be an utter impossibility Often I fell behind when the driver's lash was sure to greet my back infusing into my sick and drooping body a little temporary energy I continued to decline until at length the whip became entirely ineffectual The sharpest sting of the rawhide could not arouse me Finally in September when the busy season of cotton picking was at hand I was unable to leave my cabin Up to this time I had received no medicine nor any attention from my master or mistress The old cook visited me occasionally preparing me corn coffee and sometimes boiling a bit of bacon when I had grown too feeble to accomplish it myself When it was said that I would die Master Epps unwilling to bear the loss which the death of an animal worth a thousand dollars would bring upon him concluded to incur the expense of sending to Holmesville for Dr Wines He announced to Epps that it was the effect of the climate and there was a probability of his losing me He directed me to eat no meat and to partake of no more food than was absolutely necessary to sustain life Several weeks elapsed during which time under the scanty diet to which I was subjected I had partially recovered One morning long before I was in a proper condition to labor Epps appeared at the cabin door and presenting me a sack ordered me to the cotton field At this time I had had no experience whatever in cotton picking It was an awkward business indeed While others used both hands snatching the cotton and depositing it in the mouth of the sack with a precision and dexterity that was incomprehensible to me I had to seize the boll with one hand and deliberately draw out the white gushing blossom with the other Depositing the cotton in the sack moreover was a difficulty that demanded the exercise of both hand and eyes I was compelled to pick it from the ground where it would fall nearly as often as from the stalk where it had grown I made havoc also with the branches loaded with the yet unbroken bolls the long cumbersome sack swinging from side to side in a manner not allowable in the cotton field After a most laborious day I arrived at the gin house with my load When the scale determined its weight to be only ninety five pounds not half the quantity required of the poorest picker Epps threatened the severest flogging but in consideration of my being a raw hand concluded to pardon me on that occasion The following day and many days succeeding I returned at night with no better success I was evidently not designed for that kind of labor I had not the gift the dexterous fingers and quick motion of Patsey who could fly along one side of a row of cotton stripping it of its undefiled and fleecy whiteness miraculously fast Practice and whipping were alike unavailing and Epps satisfied of it at last swore I was a disgrace that I was not fit to associate with a cotton picking nigger that I could not pick enough in a day to pay the trouble of weighing it and that I should go into the cotton field no more I was now employed in cutting and hauling wood drawing cotton from the field to the gin house and performed whatever other service was required Suffice to say I was never permitted to be idle It was rarely that a day passed by without one or more whippings This occurred at the time the cotton was weighed The delinquent whose weight had fallen short was taken out stripped made to lie upon the ground face downwards when he received a punishment proportioned to his offence It is the literal unvarnished truth that the crack of the lash and the shrieking of the slaves can be heard from dark till bed time on Epps' plantation any day almost during the entire period of the cotton picking season The number of lashes is graduated according to the nature of the case Twenty five are deemed a mere brush inflicted for instance when a dry leaf or piece of boll is found in the cotton or when a branch is broken in the field fifty is the ordinary penalty following all delinquencies of the next higher grade one hundred is called severe it is the punishment inflicted for the serious offence of standing idle in the field from one hundred and fifty to two hundred is bestowed upon him who quarrels with his cabin mates and five hundred well laid on besides the mangling of the dogs perhaps is certain to consign the poor unpitied runaway to weeks of pain and agony During the two years Epps remained on the plantation at Bayou Huff Power he was in the habit as often as once in a fortnight at least of coming home intoxicated from Holmesville The shooting matches almost invariably concluded with a debauch At such times he was boisterous and half crazy Often he would break the dishes chairs and whatever furniture he could lay his hands on When satisfied with his amusement in the house he would seize the whip and walk forth into the yard Then it behooved the slaves to be watchful and exceeding wary The first one who came within reach felt the smart of his lash Sometimes for hours he would keep them running in all directions dodging around the corners of the cabins Occasionally he would come upon one unawares and if he succeeded in inflicting a fair round blow it was a feat that much delighted him The younger children and the aged who had become inactive suffered then In the midst of the confusion he would slily take his stand behind a cabin waiting with raised whip to dash it into the first black face that peeped cautiously around the corner At other times he would come home in a less brutal humor Then there must be a merry making Then all must move to the measure of a tune Then Master Epps must needs regale his melodious ears with the music of a fiddle Then did he become buoyant elastic gaily tripping the light fantastic toe around the piazza and all thorough the house Tibeats at the time of my sale had informed him I could play on the violin He had received his information from Ford Through the importunities of Mistress Epps her husband had been induced to purchase me one during a visit to New Orleans Frequently I was called into the house to play before the family mistress being passionately fond of music All of us would be assembled in the large room of the great house whenever Epps came home in one of his dancing moods No matter how worn out and tired we were there must be a general dance When properly stationed on the floor I would strike up a tune Dance you d d niggers dance Epps would shout Then there must be no halting or delay no slow or languid movements all must be brisk and lively and alert Up and down heel and toe and away we go was the order of the hour Epps' portly form mingled with those of his dusky slaves moving rapidly through all the mazes of the dance Usually his whip was in his hand ready to fall about the ears of the presumptuous thrall who dared to rest a moment or even stop to catch his breath When he was himself exhausted there would be a brief cessation but it would be very brief With a slash and crack and flourish of the whip he would shout again Dance niggers dance and away they would go once more pell mell while I spurred by an occasional sharp touch of the lash sat in a corner extracting from my violin a marvelous quick stepping tune The mistress often upbraided him declaring she would return to her father's house at Cheneyville nevertheless there were times she could not restrain a burst of laughter on witnessing his uproarious pranks Frequently we were thus detained until almost morning Bent with excessive toil actually suffering for a little refreshing rest and feeling rather as if we could cast ourselves upon the earth and weep many a night in the house of Edwin Epps have his unhappy slaves been made to dance and laugh Notwithstanding these deprivations in order to gratify the whim of an unreasonable master we had to be in the field as soon as it was light and during the day perform the ordinary and accustomed task Such deprivations could not be urged at the scales in extenuation of any lack of weight or in the cornfield for not hoeing with the usual rapidity The whippings were just as severe as if we had gone forth in the morning strengthened and invigorated by a night's repose Indeed after such frantic revels he was always more sour and savage than before punishing for slighter causes and using the whip with increased and more vindictive energy Ten years I toiled for that man without reward Ten years of my incessant labor has contributed to increase the bulk of his possessions Ten years I was compelled to address him with down cast eyes and uncovered head in the attitude and language of a slave I am indebted to him for nothing save undeserved abuse and stripes Beyond the reach of his inhuman thong and standing on the soil of the free State where I was born thanks be to Heaven I can raise my head once more among men I can speak of the wrongs I have suffered and of those who inflicted them with upraised eyes But I have no desire to speak of him or any other one otherwise than truthfully Yet to speak truthfully of Edwin Epps would be to say he is a man in whose heart the quality of kindness or of justice is not found A rough rude energy united with an uncultivated mind and an avaricious spirit are his prominent characteristics He is known as a nigger breaker distinguished for his faculty of subduing the spirit of the slave and priding himself upon his reputation in this respect as a jockey boasts of his skill in managing a refractory horse He looked upon a colored man not as a human being responsible to his Creator for the small talent entrusted to him but as a chattel personal as mere live property no better except in value than his mule or dog When the evidence clear and indisputable was laid before him that I was a free man and as much entitled to my liberty as he when on the day I left he was informed that I had a wife and children as dear to me as his own babes to him he only raved and swore denouncing the law that tore me from him and declaring he would find out the man who had forwarded the letter that disclosed the place of my captivity if there was any virtue or power in money and would take his life He thought of nothing but his loss and cursed me for having been born free He could have stood unmoved and seen the tongues of his poor slaves torn out by the roots he could have seen them burned to ashes over a slow fire or gnawed to death by dogs if it only brought him profit Such a hard cruel unjust man is Edwin Epps There was but one greater savage on Bayou Boeuf than he Jim Burns' plantation was cultivated as already mentioned exclusively by women That barbarian kept their backs so sore and raw that they could not perform the customary labor demanded daily of the slave He boasted of his cruelty and through all the country round was accounted a more thorough going energetic man than even Epps A brute himself Jim Burns had not a particle of mercy for his subject brutes and like a fool whipped and scourged away the very strength upon which depended his amount of gain Epps remained on Huff Power two years when having accumulated a considerable sum of money he expended it in the purchase of the plantation on the east bank of Bayou Boeuf where he still continues to reside He took possession of it in after the holidays were passed He carried thither with him nine slaves all of whom except myself and Susan who has since died remain there yet He made no addition to this force and for eight years the following were my companions in his quarters viz Abram Wiley Phebe Bob Henry Edward and Patsey All these except Edward born since were purchased out of a drove by Epps during the time he was overseer for Archy B Williams whose plantation is situated on the shore of Red River not far from Alexandria Abram was tall standing a full head above any common man He is sixty years of age and was born in Tennessee Twenty years ago he was purchased by a trader carried into South Carolina and sold to James Buford of Williamsburgh county in that State In his youth he was renowned for his great strength but age and unremitting toil have somewhat shattered his powerful frame and enfeebled his mental faculties Wiley is forty eight He was born on the estate of William Tassle and for many years took charge of that gentleman's ferry over the Big Black River in South Carolina Phebe was a slave of Buford Tassle's neighbor and having married Wiley he bought the latter at her instigation Buford was a kind master sheriff of the county and in those days a man of wealth Bob and Henry are Phebe's children by a former husband their father having been abandoned to give place to Wiley That seductive youth had insinuated himself into Phebe's affections and therefore the faithless spouse had gently kicked her first husband out of her cabin door Edward had been born to them on Bayou Huff Power Patsey is twenty three also from Buford's plantation She is in no wise connected with the others but glories in the fact that she is the offspring of a Guinea nigger brought over to Cuba in a slave ship and in the course of trade transferred to Buford who was her mother's owner This as I learned from them is a genealogical account of my master's shaves For years they had been together Often they recalled the memories of other days and sighed to retrace their steps to the old home in Carolina Troubles came upon their master Buford which brought far greater troubles upon them He became involved in debt and unable to bear up against his failing fortunes was compelled to sell these and others of his slaves In a chain gang they had been driven from beyond the Mississippi to the plantation of Archy B Williams Edwin Epps who for a long while had been his driver and overseer was about establishing himself in business on his own account at the time of their arrival and accepted them in payment of his wages Old Abram was a kind hearted being a sort of patriarch among us fond of entertaining his younger brethren with grave and serious discourse He was deeply versed in such philosophy as is taught in the cabin of the slave but the great absorbing hobby of Uncle Abram was General Jackson whom his young master in Tennessee had followed to the wars He loved to wander back in imagination to the place where he was born and to recount the scenes of his youth during those stirring times when the nation was in arms He had been athletic and more keen and powerful than the generality of his race but now his eye had become dim and his natural force abated Very often indeed while discussing the best method of baking the hoe cake or expatiating at large upon the glory of Jackson he would forget where he left his hat or his hoe or his basket and then would the old man be laughed at if Epps was absent and whipped if he was present So was he perplexed continually and sighed to think that he was growing aged and going to decay Philosophy and Jackson and forgetfulness had played the mischief with him and it was evident that all of them combined were fast bringing down the gray hairs of Uncle Abram to the grave Aunt Phebe had been an excellent field hand but latterly was put into the kitchen where she remained except occasionally in a time of uncommon hurry She was a sly old creature and when not in the presence of her mistress or her master was garrulous in the extreme Wiley on the contrary was silent He performed his task without murmur or complaint seldom indulging in the luxury of speech except to utter a wish that he was away from Epps and back once more in South Carolina Bob and Henry had reached the ages of twenty and twenty three and were distinguished for nothing extraordinary or unusual while Edward a lad of thirteen not yet able to maintain his row in the corn or the cotton field was kept in the great house to wait on the little Eppses Patsey was slim and straight She stood erect as the human form is capable of standing There was an air of loftiness in her movement that neither labor nor weariness nor punishment could destroy Truly Patsey was a splendid animal and were it not that bondage had enshrouded her intellect in utter and everlasting darkness would have been chief among ten thousand of her people She could leap the highest fences and a fleet hound it was indeed that could outstrip her in a race No horse could fling her from his back She was a skillful teamster She turned as true a furrow as the best and at splitting rails there were none who could excel her When the order to halt was heard at night she would have her mules at the crib unharnessed fed and curried before uncle Abram had found his hat Not however for all or any of these was she chiefly famous Such lightning like motion was in her fingers as no other fingers ever possessed and therefore it was that in cotton picking time Patsey was queen of the field She had a genial and pleasant temper and was faithful and obedient Naturally she was a joyous creature a laughing light hearted girl rejoicing in the mere sense of existence Yet Patsey wept oftener and suffered more than any of her companions She had been literally excoriated Her back bore the scars of a thousand stripes not because she was backward in her work nor because she was of an unmindful and rebellious spirit but because it had fallen to her lot to be the slave of a licentious master and a jealous mistress She shrank before the lustful eye of the one and was in danger even of her life at the hands of the other and between the two she was indeed accursed In the great house for days together there were high and angry words poutings and estrangement whereof she was the innocent cause Nothing delighted the mistress so much as to see her suffer and more than once when Epps had refused to sell her has she tempted me with bribes to put her secretly to death and bury her body in some lonely place in the margin of the swamp Gladly would Patsey have appeased this unforgiving spirit if it had been in her power but not like Joseph dared she escape from Master Epps leaving her garment in his hand Patsey walked under a cloud If she uttered a word in opposition to her master's will the lash was resorted to at once to bring her to subjection if she was not watchful when about her cabin or when walking in the yard a billet of wood or a broken bottle perhaps hurled from her mistress' hand would smite her unexpectedly in the face The enslaved victim of lust and hate Patsey had no comfort of her life These were my companions and fellow slaves with whom I was accustomed to be driven to the field and with whom it has been my lot to dwell for ten years in the log cabins of Edwin Epps They if living are yet toiling on the banks of Bayou Boeuf never destined to breathe as I now do the blessed air of liberty nor to shake off the heavy shackles that enthrall them until they shall lie down forever in the dust XIV DESTRUCTION OF THE COTTON CROP IN DEMAND FOR LABORERS IN ST MARY'S PARISH SENT THITHER IN A DROVE THE ORDER OF THE

OF THE SLAVE DESCRIPTION OF THE FISH TRAP THE MURDER OF THE MAN FROM NATCHEZ EPPS CHALENGED BY MARSHALL THE INFLUENCE OF SLAVERY THE LOVE OF FREEDOM THE first year of Epps' residence on the bayou the caterpillars almost totally destroyed the cotton crop throughout that region There was little to be done so that the slaves were necessarily idle half the time However there came a rumor to Bayou Boeuf that wages were high and laborers in great demand on the sugar plantations in St Mary's parish This parish is situated on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico about one hundred and forty miles from Avoyelles The Rio Teche a considerable stream flows through St Mary's to the gulf It was determined by the planters on the receipt of this intelligence to make up a drove of slaves to be sent down to Tuckapaw in St Mary's for the purpose of hiring them out in the cane fields Accordingly in the month of September there were one hundred and forty seven collected at Holmesville Abram Bob and myself among the number Of these about one half were women Epps Alonson Pierce Henry Toler and Addison Roberts were the white men selected to accompany and take charge of the drove They had a two horse carriage and two saddle horses for their use A large wagon drawn by four horses and driven by John a boy belonging to Mr Roberts carried the blankets and provisions About o'clock in the afternoon having been fed preparations were made to depart The duty assigned me was to take charge of the blankets and provisions and see that none were lost by the way The carriage proceeded in advance the wagon following behind this the slaves were arranged while the two horsemen brought up the rear and in this order the procession moved out of Holmesville That night we reached a Mr McCrow's plantation a distance of ten or fifteen miles when we were ordered to halt Large fires were built and each one spreading his blanket on the ground laid down upon it The white men lodged in the great house An hour before day we were aroused by the drivers coming among us cracking their whips and ordering us to arise Then the blankets were rolled up and being severally delivered to me and deposited in the wagon the procession set forth again The following night it rained violently We were all drenched our clothes saturated with mud and water Reaching an open shed formerly a gin house we found beneath it such shelter as it afforded There was not room for all of us to lay down There we remained huddled together through the night continuing our march as usual in the morning During the journey we were fed twice a day boiling our bacon and baking our corn cake at the fires in the same manner as in our huts We passed through Lafayetteville Mountsville New Town to Centreville where Bob and Uncle Abram were hired Our number decreased as we advanced nearly every sugar plantation requiring the services of one or more On our route we passed the Grand Coteau or prairie a vast space of level monotonous country without a tree except an occasional one which had been transplanted near some dilapidated dwelling It was once thickly populated and under cultivation but for some cause had been abandoned The business of the scattered inhabitants that now dwell upon it is principally raising cattle Immense herds were feeding upon it as we passed In the centre of the Grand Coteau one feels as if he were on the ocean out of sight of land As far as the eye can see in all directions it is but a ruined and deserted waste I was hired to Judge Turner a distinguished man and extensive planter whose large estate is situated on Bayou Salle within a few miles of the gulf Bayou Salle is a small stream flowing into the bay of Atchafalaya For some days I was employed at Turner's in repairing his sugar house when a cane knife was put into my hand and with thirty or forty others I was sent into the field I found no such difficulty in learning the art of cutting cane that I had in picking cotton It came to me naturally and intuitively and in a short time I was able to keep up with the fastest knife Before the cutting was over however Judge Tanner transferred me from the field to the sugar house to act there in the capacity of driver From the time of the commencement of sugar making to the close the grinding and boiling does not cease day or night The whip was given me with directions to use it upon any one who was caught standing idle If I failed to obey them to the letter there was another one for my own back In addition to this my duty was to call on and off the different gangs at the proper time I had no regular periods of rest and could never snatch but a few moments of sleep at a time It is the custom in Louisiana as I presume it is in other slave States to allow the slave to retain whatever compensation he may obtain for services performed on Sundays In this way only are they able to provide themselves with any luxury or convenience whatever When a slave purchased or kidnapped in the North is transported to a cabin on Bayou Boeuf he is furnished with neither knife nor fork nor dish nor kettle nor any other thing in the shape of crockery or furniture of any nature or description He is furnished with a blanket before he reaches there and wrapping that around him he can either stand up or lie down upon the ground or on a board if his master has no use for it He is at liberty to find a gourd in which to keep his meal or he can eat his corn from the cob just as he pleases To ask the master for a knife or skillet or any small convenience of the kind would be answered with a kick or laughed at as a joke Whatever necessary article of this nature is found in a cabin has been purchased with Sunday money However injurious to the morals it is certainly a blessing to the physical condition of the slave to be permitted to break the Sabbath Otherwise there would be no way to provide himself with any utensils which seem to be indispensable to him who is compelled to be his own cook On cane plantations in sugar time there is no distinction as to the days of the week It is well understood that all hands must labor on the Sabbath and it is equally well understood that those especially who are hired as I was to Judge Turner and others in succeeding years shall receive remuneration for it It is usual also in the most hurrying time of cotton picking to require the same extra service From this source slaves generally are afforded an opportunity of earning sufficient to purchase a knife a kettle tobacco and so forth The females discarding the latter luxury are apt to expend their little revenue in the purchase of gaudy ribbons wherewithal to deck their hair in the merry season of the holidays I remained in St Mary's until the first of January during which time my Sunday money amounted to ten dollars I met with other good fortune for which I was indebted to my violin my constant companion the source of profit and soother of my sorrows during years of servitude There was a grand party of whites assembled at Mr Yarney's in Centreville a hamlet in the vicinity of Turner's plantation I was employed to play for them and so well pleased were the merry makers with my performance that a contribution was taken for my benefit which amounted to seventeen dollars With this sum in possession I was looked upon by my fellows as a millionaire It afforded me great pleasure to look at it to count it over and over again day after day Visions of cabin furniture of water pails of pocket knives new shoes and coats and hats floated through my fancy and up through all rose the triumphant contemplation that I was the wealthiest nigger on Bayou Boeuf Vessels run up the Rio Teche to Centreville While there I was bold enough one day to present myself before the captain of a steamer and beg permission to hide myself among the freight I was emboldened to risk the hazard of such a step from overhearing a conversation in the course of which I ascertained he was a native of tile North I did not relate to him the particulars of my history but only expressed an ardent desire to escape from slavery to a free State He pitied me but said it would be impossible to avoid the vigilant custom house officers in New Orleans and that detection would subject him to punishment and his vessel to confiscation My earnest entreaties evidently excited his sympathies and doubtless he would have yielded to them could he have done so with any kind of safety I was compelled to smother the sudden flame that lighted up my bosom with sweet hopes of liberation and turn my steps once more towards the increasing darkness of despair Immediately after this event the drove assembled at Centreville and several of the owners having arrived and collected the monies due for our services we were driven back to Bayou Boeuf It was on our return while passing through a small village that I caught sight of Tibeats seated in the door of a dirty grocery looking somewhat seedy and out of repair Passion and poor whisky I doubt not have ere this laid him on the shelf During our absence I learned from Aunt Phebe and Patsey that the latter had been getting deeper and deeper into trouble The poor girl was truly an object of pity Old Hogjaw the name by which Epps was called when the slaves were by themselves had beaten her more severely and frequently than ever As surely as he came from Holmesville elated with liquor and it was often in those days he would whip her merely to gratify the mistress would punish her to an extent almost beyond endurance for an offence of which he himself was the sole and irresistible cause In his sober moments he could not always be prevailed upon to indulge his wife's insatiable thirst for vengeance To be rid of Patsey to place her beyond sight or reach by sale or death or in any other manner of late years seemed to be the ruling thought and passion of my mistress Patsey had been a favorite when a child even in the great house She had been petted and admired for her uncommon sprightliness and pleasant disposition She had been fed many a time so Uncle Abram said even on biscuit and milk when the madam in her younger days was wont to call her to the piazza and fondle her as she would a playful kitten But a sad change had come over the spirit of the woman Now only black and angry fiends ministered in the temple of her heart until she could look on Patsey but with concentrated venom Mistress Epps was not naturally such an evil woman after all She was possessed of the devil jealousy it is true but aside from that there was much in her character to admire Her father Mr Roberts resided in Cheneyville an influential and honorable man and as much respected throughout the parish as any other citizen She had been well educated at some institution this side the Mississippi was beautiful accomplished and usually good humored She was kind to all of us but Patsey frequently in the absence of her husband sending out to us some little dainty from her own table In other situations in a different society from that which exists on the shores of Bayou Boeuf she would have been pronounced an elegant and fascinating woman An ill wind it was that blew her into the arms of Epps He respected and loved his wife as much as a coarse nature like his is capable of loving but supreme selfishness always overmastered conjugal affection He loved as well as baser natures can But a mean heart and soul were in that man He was ready to gratify any whim to grant any request she made provided it did not cost too much Patsey was equal to any two of his slaves in the cotton field He could not replace her with the same money she would bring The idea of disposing of her therefore could not be entertained The mistress did not regard her at all in that light The pride of the haughty woman was aroused the blood of the fiery southern boiled at the sight of Patsey and nothing less than trampling out the life of the helpless bondwoman would satisfy her Sometimes the current of her wrath turned upon him whom she had just cause to hate But the storm of angry words would pass over at length and there would be a season of calm again At such times Patsey trembled with fear and cried as if her heart would break for she knew from painful experience that if mistress should work herself to the red hot pitch of rage Epps would quiet her at last with a promise that Patsey should be flogged a promise he was sure to keep Thus did pride and jealousy and vengeance war with avarice and brute passion in the mansion of my master filling it with daily tumult and contention Thus upon the head of Patsey the simpleminded slave in whose heart God had implanted the seeds of virtue the force of all these domestic tempests spent itself at last During the summer succeeding my return from St Mary's parish I conceived a plan of providing myself with food which though simple succeeded beyond expectation It has been followed by many others in my condition up and down the bayou and of such benefit has it become that I am almost persuaded to look upon myself as a benefactor That summer the worms got into the bacon Nothing but ravenous hunger could induce us to swallow it The weekly allowance of meal scarcely sufficed to satisfy us It was customary with us as it is with all in that region where the allowance is exhausted before Saturday night or is in such a state as to render it nauseous and disgusting to hunt in the swamps for coon and opossum This however must be done at night after the day's work is accomplished There are planters whose slaves for months at a time have no other meat than such as is obtained in this manner No objections are made to hunting inasmuch as it dispenses with drafts upon the smoke house and because every marauding coon that is killed is so much saved from the standing corn They are hunted with dogs and clubs slaves not being allowed the use of fire arms The flesh of the coon is palatable but verily there is nothing in all butcherdom so delicious as a roasted 'possum They are a round rather long bodied little animal of a whitish color with nose like a pig and caudal extremity like a rat They burrow among the roots and in the hollows of the gum tree and are clumsy and slow of motion They are deceitful and cunning creatures On receiving the slightest tap of a stick they will roll over on the ground and feign death If the hunter leaves him in pursuit of another without first taking particular pains to break his neck the chances are on his return he is not to be found The little animal has out witted the enemy has played 'possum and is off But after a long and hard day's work the weary slave feels little like going to the swamp for his supper and half the time prefers throwing himself on the cabin floor without it It is for the interest of the master that the servant should not suffer in health from starvation and it is also for his interest that he should not become gross from over feeding In the estimation of the owner a slave is the most serviceable when in rather a lean and lank condition such a condition as the race horse is in when fitted for the course and in that condition they are generally to be found on the sugar and cotton plantations along Red River My cabin was within a few rods of the bayou bank and necessity being indeed the mother of invention I resolved upon a mode of obtaining the requisite amount of food without the trouble of resorting nightly to the woods This was to construct a fish trap Having in my mind conceived the manner in which it could be done the next Sunday I set about putting it into practical execution It may be impossible for me to convey to the reader a full and correct idea of its construction but the following will serve as a general description A frame between two and three feet square is made and of a greater or less height according to the depth of water Boards or slats are nailed on three sides of this frame not so closely however as to prevent the water circulating freely through it A door is fitted into the fourth side in such manner that it will slide easily up and down in the grooves cut in the two posts A movable bottom is then so fitted that it can be raised to the top of the frame without difficulty In the centre of the movable bottom an auger hole is bored and into this one end of a handle or round stick is fastened on the under side so loosely that it will turn The handle ascends from the centre of the movable bottom to the top of the frame or as much higher as is desirable Up and down this handle in a great many places are gimlet holes through which small sticks are inserted extending to opposite sides of the frame So many of these small sticks are running out from the handle in all directions that a fish of any considerable dimensions cannot pass through without hitting one of them The frame is then placed in the water and made stationary The trap is set by sliding or drawing up the door and kept in that position by another stick one end of which rests in a notch on the inner side the other end in a notch made in the handle running up from the centre of the movable bottom The trap is baited by rolling a handful of wet meal and cotton together until it becomes hard and depositing it in the back part of the frame A fish swimming through the upraised door towards the bait necessarily strikes one of the small sticks turning the handle which displacing the stick supporting the door the latter falls securing the fish within the frame Taking hold of the top of the handle the movable bottom is then drawn up to the surface of the water and the fish taken out There may have been other such traps in use before mine was constructed but if there were I had never happened to see one Bayou Boeuf abounds in fish of large size and excellent quality and after this time I w as very rarely in want of one for myself or for my comrades Thus a mine was opened a new resource was developed hitherto unthought of by the enslaved children of Africa who toil and hunger along the shores of that sluggish but prolific stream About the time of which I am now writing an event occurred in our immediate neighborhood which made a deep impression upon me and which shows the state of society existing there and the manner in which affronts are oftentimes avenged Directly opposite our quarters on the other side of the bayou was situated the plantation of Mr Marshall He belonged to a family among the most wealthy and aristocratic in the country A gentleman from the vicinity of Natchez had been negotiating with him for the purchase of the estate One day a messenger came in great haste to our plantation saying that a bloody and fearful battle was going on at Marshall's that blood had been spilled and unless the combatants were forthwith separated the result would be disastrous On repairing to Marshall's house a scene presented itself that beggars description On the floor of one of the rooms lay the ghastly corpse of the man from Natchez while Marshall enraged and covered with wounds and blood was stalking back and forth breathing out threatenings and slaughter A difficulty had arisen in the course of their negotiation high words ensued when drawing their weapons the deadly strife began that ended so unfortunately Marshall was never placed in confinement A sort of trial or investigation was had at Marksville when he was acquitted and returned to his plantation rather more respected as I thought than ever from the fact that the blood of a fellow being was on his soul Epps interested himself in his behalf accompanying him to Marksville and on all occasions loudly justifying him but his services in this respect did not afterwards deter a kinsman of this same Marshall from seeking his life also A brawl occurred between them over a gambling table which terminated in a deadly feud Riding up on horseback in front of the house one day armed with pistols and bowie knife Marshall challenged him to come forth and make a final settlement of the quarrel or he would brand him as a coward and shoot him like a dog the first opportunity Not through cowardice nor from any conscientious scruples in my opinion but through the influence of his wife he was restrained from accepting the challenge of his enemy A reconciliation however was effected afterward since which time they have been on terms of the closest intimacy Such occurrences which would bring upon the parties concerned in them merited and condign punishment in the Northern States are frequent on the bayou and pass without notice and almost without comment Every man carries his bowie knife and when two fall out they set to work hacking and thrusting at each other more like savages than civilized and enlightened beings The existence of Slavery in its most cruel form among them has a tendency to brutalize the humane and finer feelings of their nature Daily witnesses of human suffering listening to the agonizing screeches of the slave beholding him writhing beneath the merciless lash bitten and torn by dogs dying without attention and buried without shroud or coffin it cannot otherwise be expected than that they should become brutified and reckless of human life It is true there are many kind hearted and good men in the parish of Avoyelles such men as William Ford who can look with pity upon the sufferings of a slave just as there are over all the world sensitive and sympathetic spirits who cannot look with indifference upon the sufferings of any creature which the Almighty has endowed with life It is not the fault of the slaveholder that he is cruel so much as it is the fault of the system under which he lives He cannot withstand the influence of habit and associations that surround him Taught from earliest childhood by all that he sees and hears that the rod is for the slave's back he will not be apt to change his opinions in maturer years There may be humane masters as there certainly are inhuman ones there may be slaves well clothed well fed and happy as there surely are those half clad half starved and miserable nevertheless the institution that tolerates such wrong and inhumanity as I have witnessed is a cruel unjust and barbarous one Men may write fictions portraying lowly life as it is or as it is not may expatiate with owlish gravity upon the bliss of ignorance discourse flippantly from arm chairs of the pleasures of slave life but let them toil with him in the field sleep with him in the cabin feed with him on husks let them behold him scourged hunted trampled on and they will come back with another story in their mouths Let them know the heart of the poor slave learn his secret thoughts thoughts he dare not utter in the hearing of the white man let them sit by him in the silent watches of the night converse with him in trustful confidence of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and they will find that ninety nine out of every hundred are intelligent enough to understand their situation and to cherish in their bosoms the love of freedom as passionately as themselves XV LABORS ON SUGAR PLANTATIONS THE MODE OF PLANTING CANE OF HOEING CANE CANE RICKS CUTTING CANE DESCRIPTION OF THE CANE KNIFE WINROWING PREPARING FOR SUCCEEDING CROPS DESCRIPTION OF HAWKINS' SUGAR MILL ON BAYOU BOEUF THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS THE CARNIVAL SEASON OF THE CHILDREN OF BONDAGE THE CHRISTMAS SUPPER RED THE FAVORITE COLOR THE VIOLIN AND THE CONSOLATION IT AFFORDED THE CHRISTMAS DANCE LIVELY THE COQUETTE SAM ROBERTS AND HIS RIVALS SLAVE SONGS SOUTHERN LIFE AS IT IS THREE DAYS IN THE YEAR THE SYSTEM OF MARRIAGE UNCLE ABRAM'S CONTEMPT OF MATRIMONY IN consequence of my inability in cotton picking Epps was in the habit of hiring me out on sugar plantations during the season of cane cutting and sugar making He received for my services a dollar a day with the money supplying my place on his cotton plantation Cutting cane was an employment that suited me and for three successive years I held the lead row at Hawkins' leading a gang of from fifty to an hundred hands In a previous the mode of cultivating cotton is described This may be the proper place to speak of the manner of cultivating cane The ground is prepared in beds the same as it is prepared for the reception of the cotton seed except it is ploughed deeper Drills are made in the same manner Planting commences in January and continues until April It is necessary to plant a sugar field only once in three years Three crops are taken before the seed or plant is exhausted Three gangs are employed in the operation One draws the cane from the rick or stack cutting the top and flags from the stalk leaving only that part which is sound and healthy Each joint of the cane has an eye like the eye of a potato which sends forth a sprout when buried in the soil Another gang lays the cane in the drill placing two stalks side by side in such manner that joints will occur once in four or six inches The third gang follows with hoes drawing earth upon the stalks and covering them to the depth of three inches In four weeks at the farthest the sprouts appear above the ground and from this time forward grow with great rapidity A sugar field is hoed three times the same as cotton save that a greater quantity of earth is drawn to the roots By the first of August hoeing is usually over About the middle of September whatever is required for seed is cut and tacked in ricks as they are termed In October it is ready for the mill or sugar house and then the general cutting begins The blade of a cane knife is fifteen inches long three inches wide in the middle and tapering towards the point and handle The blade is thin and in order to be at all serviceable must be kept very sharp Every third hand takes the lead of two others one of whom is on each side of him The lead hand in the first place with a blow of his knife shears the flags from the stalk He next cuts off the top down as far as it is green He must be careful to sever all the green from the ripe part inasmuch as the juice of the former sours the molasses and renders it unsalable Then he severs the stalk at the root and lays it directly behind him His right and left hand companions lay their stalks when cut in the same manner upon his To every three hands there is a cart which follows and the stalks are thrown into it by the younger slaves when it is drawn to the sugar house and ground If the planter apprehends a frost the cane is winrowed Winrowing is the cutting the stalks at an early period and throwing them lengthwise in the water furrow in such a manner that the tops will cover the butts of the stalks They will remain in this condition three weeks or a month without souring and secure from frost When the proper time arrives they are taken up trimmed and carted to the sugarhouse In the month of January the slaves enter the field again to prepare for another crop The ground is now strewn with the tops and flags cut from the past year's cane On a dry day fire is set to this combustible refuse which sweeps over the field leaving it bare and clean and ready for the hoes The earth is loosened about the roots of the old stubble and in process of time another crop springs up from the last year's seed It is the same the year following but the third year the seed has exhausted its strength and the field must be ploughed and planted again The second year the cane is sweeter and yields more than the first and the third year more than the second During the three seasons I labored on Hawkins' plantation I was employed a considerable portion of the time in the sugar house He is celebrated as the producer of the finest variety of white sugar The following is a general description of his sugar house and the process of manufacture The mill is an immense brick building standing on the shore of the bayou Running out from the building is an open shed at least an hundred feet in length and forty or fifty feet in width The boiler in which the steam is generated is situated outside the main building the machinery and engine rest on a brick pier fifteen feet above the floor within the body of the building The machinery turns two great iron rollers between two and three feet in diameter and six or eight feet in length They are elevated above the brick pier and roll in towards each other An endless carrier made of chain and wood like leathern belts used in small mills extends from the iron rollers out of the main building and through the entire length of the open shed The carts in which the cane is brought from the field as fast as it is cut are unloaded at the sides of the shed All along the endless carrier are ranged slave children whose business it is to place the cane upon it when it is conveyed through the shed into the main building where it falls between the rollers is crushed and drops upon another carrier that conveys it out of the main building in an opposite direction depositing it in the top of a chimney upon a fire beneath which consumes it It is necessary to burn it in this manner because otherwise it would soon fill the building and more especially because it would soon sour and engender disease The juice of the cane falls into a conductor underneath the iron rollers and is carried into a reservoir Pipes convey it from thence into five filterers holding several hogsheads each These filterers are filled with bone black a substance resembling pulverized charcoal It is made of bones calcinated in close vessels and is used for the purpose of decolorizing by filtration the cane juice before boiling Through these five filterers it passes in succession and then runs into a large reservoir underneath the ground floor from whence it is carried up by means of a steam pump into a clarifier made of sheet iron where it is heated by steam until it boils From the first clarifier it is carried in pipes to a second and a third and thence into close iron pans through which tubes pass filled with steam While in a boiling state it flows through three pans in succession and is then carried in other pipes down to the coolers on the ground floor Coolers are wooden boxes with sieve bottoms made of the finest wire As soon as the syrup passes into the coolers and is met by the air it grains and the molasses at once escapes through the sieves into a cistern It is then white or loaf sugar of the finest kind clear clean and as white as snow When cool it is taken out packed in hogsheads and is ready for market The molasses is then carried from the cistern into the upper story again and by another process converted into brown sugar There are larger mills and those constructed differently from the one thus imperfectly described but none perhaps more celebrated than this anywhere on Bayou Boeuf Lambert of New Orleans is a partner of Hawkins He is a man of vast wealth holding as I have been told an interest in over forty different sugar plantations in Louisiana The only respite from constant labor the slave has through the whole year is during the Christmas holidays Epps allowed us three others allow four five and six days according to the measure of their generosity It is the only time to which they look forward with any interest or pleasure They are glad when night comes not only because it brings them a few hours repose but because it brings them one day nearer Christmas It is hailed with equal delight by the old and the young even Uncle Abram ceases to glorify Andrew Jackson and Patsey forgets her many sorrows amid the general hilarity of the holidays It is the time of feasting and frolicking and fiddling the carnival season with the children of bondage They are the only days when they are allowed a little restricted liberty and heartily indeed do they enjoy it It is the custom for one planter to give a Christmas supper inviting the shaves from neighboring plantations to join his own on the occasion for instance one year it is given by Epps the next by Marshall the next by Hawkins and so on Usually from three to five hundred are assembled coming together on foot in carts on horseback on mules riding double and triple sometimes a boy and girl at others a girl and two boys and at others again a boy a girl and an old woman Uncle Abram astride a mule with Aunt Phebe and Patsey behind him trotting towards a Christmas supper would be no uncommon sight on Bayou Boeuf Then too of all days i' the year they array themselves in their best attire The cotton coat has been washed clean the stump of a tallow candle has been applied to the shoes and if so fortunate as to possess a rimless or a crownless hat it is placed jauntily on the head They are welcomed with equal cordiality however if they come bare headed and bare footed to the feast As a general thing the women wear handkerchiefs tied about their heads but if chance has thrown in their way a fiery red ribbon or a cast off bonnet of their mistress' grandmother it is sure to be worn on such occasions Red the deep blood red is decidedly the favorite color among the enslaved damsels of my acquaintance If a red ribbon does not encircle the neck you will be certain to find all the hair of their woolly heads tied up with red strings of one sort or another The table is spread in the open air and loaded with varieties of meat and piles of vegetables Bacon and corn meal at such times are dispensed with Sometimes the cooking is performed in the kitchen on the plantation at others in the shade of wide branching trees In the latter case a ditch is dug in the ground and wood laid in and burned until it is filled with glowing coals over which chickens ducks turkeys pigs and not unfrequently the entire body of a wild ox are roasted They are furnished also with flour of which biscuits are made and often with peach and other preserves with tarts and every manner and description of pies except the mince that being an article of pastry as yet unknown among them Only the slave who has lived all the years on his scanty allowance of meal and bacon can appreciate such suppers White people in great numbers assemble to witness the gastronomical enjoyments They seat themselves at the rustic table the males on one side the females on the other The two between whom there may have been an exchange of tenderness invariably manage to sit opposite for the omnipresent Cupid disdains not to hurl his arrows into the simple hearts of slaves Unalloyed and exulting happiness lights up the dark faces of them all The ivory teeth contrasting with their black complexions exhibit two long white streaks the whole extent of the table All round the bountiful board a multitude of eyes roll in ecstacy Giggling and laughter and the clattering of cutlery and crockery succeed Cuffee's elbow hunches his neighbor's side impelled by an involuntary impulse of delight Nelly shakes her finger at Sambo and laughs she knows not why and so the fun and merriment flows on When the viands have disappeared and the hungry maws of the children of toil are satisfied then next in the order of amusement is the Christmas dance My business on these gala days always was to play on the violin The African race is a music loving one proverbially and many there were among my fellow bondsmen whose organs of tune were strikingly developed and who could thumb the banjo with dexterity but at the expense of appearing egotistical I must nevertheless declare that I was considered the Ole Bull of Bayou Boeuf My master often received letters sometimes from a distance of ten miles requesting him to send me to play at a ball or festival of the whites He received his compensation and usually I also returned with many picayunes jingling in my pockets the extra contributions of those to whose delight I had administered In this manner I became more acquainted than I otherwise would up and down the bayou The young men and maidens of Holmesville always knew there was to be a jollification somewhere whenever Platt Epps was seen passing through the town with his fiddle in his hand Where are you going now Platt and What is coming off tonight Platt would be interrogatories issuing from every door and window and many a time when there was no special hurry yielding to pressing importunities Platt would draw his bow and sitting astride his mule perhaps discourse musically to a crowd of delighted children gathered around him in the street Alas had it not been for my beloved violin I scarcely can conceive how I could have endured the long years of bondage It introduced me to great houses relieved me of many days' labor in the field supplied me with conveniences for my cabin with pipes and tobacco and extra pairs of shoes and oftentimes led me away from the presence of a hard master to witness scenes of jollity and mirth It was my companion the friend of my bosom triumphing loudly when I was joyful and uttering its soft melodious consolations when I was sad Often at midnight when sleep had fled affrighted from the cabin and my soul was disturbed and troubled with the contemplation of my fate it would sing me a song of peace On holy Sabbath days when an hour or two of leisure was allowed it would accompany me to some quiet place on the bayou bank and lifting up its voice discourse kindly and pleasantly indeed It heralded my name round the country made me friends who otherwise would not have noticed me gave me an honored seat at the yearly feasts and secured the loudest and heartiest welcome of them all at the Christmas dance The Christmas dance Oh ye pleasure seeking sons and daughters of idleness who move with measured step listless and snail like through the slow winding cotillon if ye wish to look upon the celerity if not the poetry of motion upon genuine happiness rampant and unrestrained go down to Louisiana and see the slaves dancing in the starlight of a Christmas night On that particular Christmas I have now in my mind a description whereof will serve as a description of the day generally Miss Lively and Mr Sam the first belonging to Stewart the latter to Roberts started the ball It was well known that Sam cherished an ardent passion for Lively as also did one of Marshall's and another of Carey's boys for Lively was lively indeed and a heart breaking coquette withal It was a victory for Sam Roberts when rising from the repast she gave him her hand for the first figure in preference to either of his rivals They were somewhat crest fallen and shaking their heads angrily rather intimated they would like to pitch into Mr Sam and hurt him badly But not an emotion of wrath ruffled the placid bosom of Samuel as his legs flew like drum sticks down the outside and up the middle by the side of his bewitching partner The whole company cheered them vociferously and excited with the applause they continued tearing down after all the others had become exhausted and halted a moment to recover breath But Sam's superhuman exertions overcame him finally leaving Lively alone yet whirling like a top Thereupon one of Sam's rivals Pete Marshall dashed in and with might and main leaped and shuffled and threw himself into every conceivable shape as if determined to show Miss Lively and all the world that Sam Roberts was of no account Pete's affection however was greater than his discretion Such violent exercise took the breath out of him directly and he dropped like an empty bag Then was the time for Harry Carey to try his hand but Lively also soon out winded him amidst hurrahs and shouts fully sustaining her well earned reputation of being the fastest gal on the bayou One set off another takes its place he or she remaining longest on the floor receiving the most uproarious commendation and so the dancing continues until broad daylight It does not cease with the sound of the fiddle but in that case they set up a music peculiar to themselves This is called patting accompanied with one of those unmeaning songs composed rather for its adaptation to a certain tune or measure than for the purpose of expressing any distinct idea The patting is performed by striking the hands on the knees then striking the hands together then striking the right shoulder with one hand the left with the other all the while keeping time with the feet and singing perhaps this song Harper's creek and roarin' ribber Thar my dear we'll live forebber Den we'll go to de Ingin nation All I walls in dis creation Is pretty little wife and big plantation Chorus Up dat oak and down dat ribber Two overseers and one little nigger Or if these words are not adapted to the tune called for it may be that Old Hog Eye is a rather solemn and startling specimen of versification not however to be appreciated unless heard at the South It runneth as follows Who's been here since I've been gone Pretty little gal wid a josey on Hog Eye Old Hog Eye And Hosey too Never see de like since I was born Here come a little gal wid a josey on Hog Eye Old Hog Eye And Hosey too Or may be the following perhaps equally nonsensical but full of melody nevertheless as it flows from the negro's mouth Ebo Dick and Jurdan's Jo Them two niggers stole my yo' Chorus Hop Jim along Walk Jim along Talk Jim along c Old black Dan as black as tar He dam glad he was not dar Hop Jim along c During the remaining holidays succeeding Christmas they are provided with passes and permitted to go where they please within a limited distance or they may remain and labor on the plantation in which case they are paid for it It is very rarely however that the latter alternative is accepted They may be seen at these times hurrying in all directions as happy looking mortals as can be found on the face of the earth They are different beings from what they are in the field the temporary relaxation the brief deliverance from fear and from the lash producing an entire metamorphosis in their appearance and demeanor In visiting riding renewing old friendships or perchance reviving some old attachment or pursuing whatever pleasure may suggest itself the time is occupied Such is southern life as it is three days in the year as I found it the other three hundred and sixty two being days of weariness and fear and suffering and unremitting labor Marriage is frequently contracted during the holidays if such an institution may be said to exist among them The only ceremony required before entering into that holy estate is to obtain the consent of the respective owners It is usually encouraged by the masters of female slaves Either party can have as many husbands or wives as the owner will permit and either is at liberty to discard the other at pleasure The law in relation to divorce or to bigamy and so forth is not applicable to property of course If the wife does not belong on the same plantation with the husband the latter is permitted to visit her on Saturday nights if the distance is not too far Uncle Abram's wife lived seven miles from Epps' on Bayou Huff Power He had permission to visit her once a fortnight but he was growing old as has been said and truth to say had latterly well nigh forgotten her Uncle Abram had no time to spare from his meditations on General Jackson connubial dalliance being well enough for the young and thoughtless but unbecoming a grave and solemn philosopher like himself XVI OVERSEERS HOW THEY ARE ARMED AND ACCOMPANIED THE HOMICIDE HIS EXECUTION AT MARKSVILLE SLAVE DRIVERS APPOINTED DRIVER ON REMOVING TO BAYOU BOEUFF PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT EPPS'S ATTEMPT TO CUT PLATT'S THROAT THE ESCAPE FROM HIM PROTECTED BY THE MISTRESS FORBIDS READING AND WRITING OBTAIN A SHEET OF PAPER AFTER NINE YEARS' EFFORT THE LETTER ARMSBY THE MEAN WHITE PARTIALLY CONFIDE IN HIM HIS TREACHERY EPPS' SUSPICIONS HOW THEY WERE QUIETED BURNING THE LETTER ARMSBY LEAVES THE BAYOU DISAPPOINTMENT AND DESPAIR WITH the exception of my trip to St Mary's parish and my absence during the cane cutting seasons I was constantly employed on the plantation of Master Epps He was considered but a small planter not having a sufficient number of hands to require the services of an overseer acting in the latter capacity himself Not able to increase his force it was his custom to hire during the hurry of cotton picking On larger estates employing fifty or a hundred or perhaps two hundred hands an overseer is deemed indispensable These gentlemen ride into the field on horseback without an exception to my knowledge armed with pistols bowie knife whip and accompanied by several dogs They follow equipped in this fashion in rear of the slaves keeping a sharp lookout upon them all The requisite qualifications in an overseer are utter heartlessness brutality and cruelty It is his business to produce large crops and if that is accomplished no matter what amount of suffering it may have cost The presence of the dogs are necessary to overhaul a fugitive who may take to his heels as is sometimes the case when faint or sick he is unable to maintin his row and unable also to endure the whip The pistols are reserved for any dangerous emergency there having been instances when such weapons were necessary Goaded into uncontrollable madness even the slave will sometimes turn upon his oppressor The gallows were standing at Marksville last January upon which one was executed a year ago for killing his overseer It occurred not many miles from Epps' plantation on Red River The slave was given his task at splitting rails In the course of the day the overseer sent him on an errand which occupied so much time that it was not possible for him to perform the task The next day he was called to an account but the loss of time occasioned by the errand was no excuse and he was ordered to kneel and bare his back for the reception of the lash They were in the woods alone beyond the reach of sight or hearing The boy submitted until maddened at such injustice and insane with pain he sprang to his feet and seizing an axe literally chopped the overseer in pieces He made no attempt whatever at concealment but hastening to his master related the whole affair and declared himself ready to expiate the wrong by the sacrifice of his life He was led to the scaffold and while the rope was around his neck maintained an undismayed and fearless bearing and with his last words justified the act Besides the overseer there are drivers under him the number being in proportion to the number of hands in the field The drivers are black who in addition to the performance of their equal share of work are compelled to do the whipping of their several gangs Whips hang around their necks and if they fail to use them thoroughly are whipped themselves They have a few privileges however for example in cane cutting the hands are not allowed to sit down long enough to eat their dinners Carts filled with corn cake cooked at the kitchen are driven into the field at noon The cake is distributed by the drivers and must be eaten with the least possible delay When the slave ceases to perspire as he often does when taxed beyond his strength he falls to the ground and becomes entirely helpless It is then the duty of the driver to drag him into the shade of the standing cotton or cane or of a neighboring tree where he dashes buckets of water upon him and uses other means of bringing out perspiration again when he is ordered to his place and compelled to continue his labor At Huff Power when I first came to Epps' Tom one of Roberts' negroes was driver He was a burly fellow and severe in the extreme After Epps' removal to Bayou Boeuf that distinguished honor was conferred upon myself Up to the time of my departure I had to wear a whip about my neck in the field If Epps was present I dared not show any lenity not having the Christian fortitude of a certain well known Uncle Tom sufficiently to brave his wrath by refusing to perform the office In that way only I escaped the immediate martyrdom he suffered and withal saved my companions much suffering as it proved in the end Epps I soon found whether actually in the field or not had his eyes pretty generally upon us From the piazza from behind some adjacent tree or other concealed point of observation he was perpetually on the watch If one of us had been backward or idle through the day we were apt to be told all about it on returning to the quarters and as it was a matter of principle with him to reprove every offence of that kind that came within his knowledge the offender not only was certain of receiving a castigation for his tardiness but I likewise was punished for permitting it If on the other hand he had seen me use the lash freely the man was satisfied Practice makes perfect truly and during my eight years' experience as a driver I learned to handle the whip with marvelous dexterity and precision throwing the lash within a hair's breadth of the back the ear the nose without however touching either of them If Epps was observed at a distance or we had reason to apprehend he was as sneaking somewhere in the vicinity I would commence plying the lash vigorously when according to arrangement they would squirm and screech as if in agony although not one of them had in fact been even grazed Patsey would take occasion if he made his appearance presently to mumble in his hearing some complaints that Platt was lashing them the whole time and Uncle Abram with an appearance of honesty peculiar to himself would declare roundly I had just whipped them worse than General Jackson whipped the enemy at New Orleans If Epps was not drunk and in one of his beastly humors this was in general satisfactory If he was some one or more of us must suffer as a matter of course Sometimes his violence assumed a dangerous form placing the lives of his human stock in jeopardy On one occasion the drunken madman thought to amuse himself by cutting my throat He had been absent at Holmesville in attendance at a shooting match and none of us were aware of his return While hoeing by the side of Patsey she exclaimed in a low voice suddenly Platt d'ye see old Hog Jaw beckoning me to come to him Glancing sideways I discovered him in the edge of the field motioning and grimacing as was his habit when half intoxicated Aware of his lewd intentions Patsey began to cry I whispered her not to look up and to continue at her work as if she had not observed him Suspecting the truth of the matter however he soon staggered up to me in a great rage What did you say to Pats he demanded with an oath I made him some evasive answer which only had the effect of increasing his violence How long have you owned this plantation say you d d nigger he inquired with a malicious sneer at the same time taking hold of my shirt collar with one hand and thrusting the other into his pocket Now I'll cut your black throat that's what I'll do drawing his knife from his pocket as he said it But with one hand he was unable to open it until finally seizing the blade in his teeth I saw he was about to succeed and felt the necessity of escaping from him for in his present reckless state it was evident he was not joking by any means My shirt was open in front and as I turned round quickly and sprang from him while he still retained his gripe it was stripped entirely from my back There was no difficulty now in eluding him He would chase me until out of breath then stop until it was recovered swear and renew the chase again Now he would command me to come to him now endeavor to coax me but I was careful to keep at a respectful distance In this manner we made the circuit of the field several times he making desperate plunges and I always dodging them more amused than frightened well knowing that when his sober senses returned he would laugh at his own drunken folly At length I observed the mistress standing by the yard fence watching our half serious half comical manoeuvres Shooting past him I ran directly to her Epps on discovering her did not follow He remained about the field an hour or more during which time I stood by the mistress having related the particulars of what had taken place Now she was aroused again denouncing her husband and Patsey about equally Finally Epps came towards the house by this time nearly sober walking demurely with his hands behind his back and attempting to look as innocent as a child As he approached nevertheless Mistress Epps began to berate him roundly heaping upon him many rather disrespectful epithets and demanding for what reason he had attempted to cut my throat Epps made wondrous strange of it all and to my surprise swore by all the saints in the calendar he had not spoken to me that day Platt you lying nigger have I was his brazen appeal to me It is not safe to contradict a master even by the assertion of a truth So I was silent and when he entered the house I returned to the field and the affair was never after alluded to Shortly after this time a circumstance occurred that came nigh divulging the secret of my real name and history which I had so long and carefully concealed and upon which I was convinced depended my final escape Soon after he purchased me Epps asked me if I could write and read and on being informed that I had received some instruction in those branches of education he assured me with emphasis if he ever caught me with a book or with pen and ink he would give me a hundred lashes He said he wanted me to understand that he bought niggers to work and not to educate He never inquired a word of my past life or from whence I came The mistress however cross examined me frequently about Washington which she supposed was my native city and more than once remarked that I did not talk nor act like the other niggers and she was sure I had seen more of the world than I admitted My great object always was to invent means of getting a letter secretly into the post office directed to some of my friends or family at the North The difficulty of such an achievement cannot be comprehended by one unacquainted with the severe restrictions imposed upon me In the first place I was deprived of pen ink and paper In the second place a slave cannot leave his plantation without a pass nor will a post master mail a letter for one without written instructions from his owner I was in slavery nine years and always watchful and on the alert before I met with the good fortune of obtaining a sheet of paper While Epps was in New Orleans one winter disposing of his cotton the mistress sent me to Holmesville with an order for several articles and among the rest a quantity of foolscap I appropriated a sheet concealing it in the cabin under the board on which I slept After various experiments I succeeded in making ink by boiling white maple bark and with a feather plucked from the wing of a duck manufactured a pen When all were asleep in the cabin by the light of the coals lying upon my plank couch I managed to complete a somewhat lengthy epistle It was directed to an old acquaintance at Sandy Hill stating my condition and urging him to take measures to restore me to liberty This letter I kept a long time contriving measures by which it could be safely deposited in the post office At length a low fellow by the name of Armsby hitherto a stranger came into the neighborhood seeking a situation as overseer He applied to Epps and was about the plantation for several days He next went over to Shaw's near by and remained with him several weeks Shaw was generally surrounded by such worthless characters being himself noted as a gambler and unprincipled man He had made a wife of his slave Charlotte and a brood of young mulattoes were growing up in his house Armsby became so much reduced at last that he was compelled to labor with the slaves A white man working in the field is a rare and unusual spectacle on Bayou Boeuf I improved every opportunity of cultivating his acquaintance privately desiring to obtain his confidence so far as to be willing to intrust the letter to his keeping He visited Marksville repeatedly he informed me a town some twenty miles distant and there I proposed to myself the letter should be mailed Carefully deliberating on the most proper manner of approaching him on the subject I concluded finally to ask him simply if he would deposit a letter for me in the Marksville post office the next time he visited that place without disclosing to him that the letter was written or any of the particulars it contained for I had fears that he might betray me and knew that some inducement must be held out to him of a pecuniary nature before it would be safe to confide in him As late as one o'clock one night I stole noiselessly from my cabin and crossing the field to Shaw's found him sleeping on the piazza I had but a few picayunes the proceeds of my fiddling performances but all I had in the world I promised him if he would do me the favor required I begged him not to expose me if he could not grant the request He assured me upon his honor he would deposit it in the Marksville post office and that he would keep it an inviolable secret forever Though the letter was in my pocket at the time I dared not then deliver it to him but stating I would have it written in a day or two bade him good night and returned to my cabin It was impossible for me to expel the suspicions I entertained and all night I lay awake revolving in my mind the safest course to pursue I was willing to risk a great deal to accomplish my purpose but should the letter by any means fall into the hands of Epps it would be a death blow to my aspirations I was perplexed in the extreme My suspicions were well founded as the sequel demonstrated The next day but one while scraping cotton in the field Epps seated himself on the line fence between Shaw's plantation and his own in such a position as to overlook the scene of our labors Presently Armsby made his appearance and mounting the fence took a seat beside him They remained two or three hours all of which time I was in an agony of apprehension That night while broiling my bacon Epps entered the cabin with his rawhide in his hand Well boy said he I understand I've got a larned nigger that writes letters and tries to get white fellows to mail 'em Wonder if you know who he is My worst fears were realized and although it may not be considered entirely creditable even under the circumstances yet a resort to duplicity and downright falsehood was the only refuge that presented itself Don't know nothing about it Master Epps I answered him assuming an air of ignorance and surprise Don't know nothing at all about it sir Wan't you over to Shaw's night before last he inquired No master was the reply Hav'nt you asked that fellow Armsby to mail a letter for you at Marksville Why Lord master I never spoke three words to him in all my life I don't know what you mean Well he continued Armsby told me to day the devil was among my niggers that I had one that needed close watching or he would run away and when I axed him why he said you come over to Shaw's and waked him up in the night and wanted him to carry a letter to Marksville What have you got to say to that ha All I've got to say master I replied is there is no truth in it How could I write a letter without any ink or paper There is nobody I want to write to 'cause I haint got no friends living as I know of That Armsby is a lying drunken fellow they say and nobody believes him anyway You know I always tell the truth and that I never go off the plantation without a pass Now master I can see what that Armsby is after plain enough Did'nt he want you to hire him for an overseer Yes he wanted me to hire him answered Epps That's it said I he wants to make you believe we're all going to run away and then he thinks you'll hire an overseer to watch us He just made that story out of whole cloth 'cause he wants to get a situation It's all a lie master you may depend on't Epps mused awhile evidently impressed with the plausibility of my theory and exclaimed I'm d d Platt if I don't believe you tell the truth He must take me for a soft to think he can come it over me with them kind of yarns musn't he Maybe he thinks he can fool me maybe he thinks I don't know nothing can't take care of my own niggers eh Soft soap old Epps eh Ha ha ha D n Armsby Set the dogs on him Platt and with many other comments descriptive of Armsby's general character and his capability of taking care of his own business and attending to his own niggers Master Epps left the cabin As soon as he was gone I threw the letter in the fire and with a desponding and despairing heart beheld the epistle which had cost me so much anxiety and thought and which I fondly hoped would have been my forerunner to the land of freedom writhe and shrivel on its bed of coals and dissolve into smoke and ashes Armsby the treacherous wretch was driven from Shaw's plantation not long subsequently much to my relief for I feared he might renew his conversation and perhaps induce Epps to credit him I knew not now whither to look for deliverance Hopes sprang up in my heart only to be crushed and blighted The summer of my life was passing away I felt I was growing prematurely old that a few years more and toil and grief and the poisonous miasma of the swamps would accomplish their work on me would consign me to the grave's embrace to moulder and be forgotten Repelled betrayed cut off from the hope of succor I could only prostrate myself upon the earth and groan in unutterable anguish The hope of rescue was the only light that cast a ray of comfort on my heart That was now flickering faint and low another breath of disappointment would extinguish it altogether leaving me to grope in midnight darkness to the end of life XVII WILEY DISREGARDS THE COUNSELS OF AUNT PHEBE AND UNCLE ABRAM AND IS CAUGHT BY THE PATROLLERS THE ORGANIZATION AND DUTIES OF THE LATTER WILEY RUNS AWAY SPECULATIONS IN REGARD TO HIM HIS UNEXPECTED RETURN HIS CAPTURE ON THE RED RIVER AND CONFINEMENT IN ALEXANDRIA JAIL DISCOVERED BY JOSEPH B ROBERTS SUBDUING DOGS IN ANTICIPATION OF ESCAPE THE FUGITIVES IN THE GREAT PINE WOODS CAPTURED BY ADAM TAYDEM AND THE INDIANS AUGUSTUS KILLED BY DOGS NELLY ELDRET'S SLAVE WOMAN THE STORY OF CELESTE THE CONCERTED MOVEMENT LEW CHENEY THE TRAITOR THE IDEA OF INSURRECTION THE year down to which time I have now arrived omitting many occurrences uninteresting to the reader was an unlucky year for my companion Wiley the husband of Phebe whose taciturn and retiring nature has thus far kept him in the background Notwithstanding Wiley seldom opened his mouth and revolved in his obscure and unpretending orbit without a grumble nevertheless the warm elements of sociality were strong in the bosom of that silent nigger In the exuberance of his self reliance disregarding the philosophy of Uncle Abram and setting the counsels of Aunt Phebe utterly at naught he had the fool hardiness to essay a nocturnal visit to a neighboring cabin without a pass So attractive was the society in which he found himself that Wiley took little note of the passing hours and the light began to break in the east before he was aware Speeding homeward as fast as he could run he hoped to reach the quarters before the horn would sound but unhappily he was spied on the way by a company of patrollers How it is in other dark places of slavery I do not know but on Bayou Boeuf there is an organization of patrollers as they are styled whose business it is to seize and whip any slave they may find wandering from the plantation They ride on horseback headed by a captain armed and accompanied by dogs They have the right either by law or by general consent to inflict discretionary chastisement upon a black man caught beyond the boundaries of his master's estate without a pass and even to shoot him if he attempts to escape Each company has a certain distance to ride up and down the bayou They are compensated by the planters who contribute in proportion to the number of slaves they own The clatter of their horses' hoofs dashing by can be heard at all hours of the light and frequently they may be seen driving a slave before them or leading him by a rope fastened around his neck to his owner's plantation Wiley fled before one of these companies thinking he could reach his cabin before they could overtake him but one of their dogs a great ravenous hound griped him by the leg and held him fast The patrollers whipped him severely and brought him a prisoner to Epps From him he received another flagellation still more severe so that the cuts of the lash and the bites of the dog rendered him sore stiff and miserable insomuch he was scarcely able to move It was impossible in such a state to keep up his row and consequently there was not an hour in the day but Wiley felt the sting of his master's rawhide on his raw and bleeding back His sufferings became intolerable and finally he resolved to run away Without disclosing his intentions to run away even to his wife Phebe he proceeded to make arrangements for carrying his plan into execution Having cooked his whole week's allowance he cautiously left the cabin on a Sunday night after the inmates of the quarters were asleep When the horn sounded in the morning Wiley did not make his appearance Search was made for him in the cabins in the corn crib in the cotton house and in every nook and corner of the premises Each of us was examined touching any knowledge we might have that could throw light upon his sudden disappearance or present whereabouts Epps raved and stormed and mounting his horse galloped to neighboring plantations making in inquiries in all directions The search was fruitless Nothing whatever was elicited going to show what had become of the missing man The dogs were led to the swamp but were unable to strike his trail They would circle away through the forest their noses to the ground but invariably returned in a short time to the spot from whence they started Wiley had escaped and so secretly and cautiously as to elude and baffle all pursuit Days and even weeks passed away and nothing could be heard of him Epps did nothing but curse and swear It was the only topic of conversation among us when alone We indulged in a great deal of speculation in regard to him one suggesting he might have been drowned in some bayou inasmuch as he was a poor swimmer another that perhaps he might have been devoured by alligators or stung by the venomous moccasin whose bite is certain and sudden death The warm and hearty sympathies of us all however were with poor Wiley wherever he might be Many an earnest prayer ascended from the lips of Uncle Abram beseeching safety for the wanderer In about three weeks when all hope of ever seeing him again was dismissed to our surprise he one day appeared among us On leaving the plantation he informed us it was his intention to make his way back to South Carolina to the old quarters of Master Buford During the day he remained secreted sometimes in the branches of a tree and at night pressed forward through the swamps Finally one morning just at dawn he reached the shore of Red River While standing on the bank considering how he could cross it a white man accosted him and demanded a pass Without one and evidently a runaway he was taken to Alexandria the shire town of the parish of Rapides and confined in prison It happened several days after that Joseph B Roberts uncle of Mistress Epps was in Alexandria and going into the jail recognized him Wiley had worked on his plantation when Epps resided at Huff Power Paying the jail fee and writing him a pass underneath which was a note to Epps requesting him not to whip him on his return Wiley was sent back to Bayou Boeuf It was the hope that hung upon this request and which Roberts assured him would be respected by his master that sustained him as he approached the house The request however as may be readily supposed was entirely disregarded After being kept in suspense three days Wiley was stripped and compelled to endure one of those inhuman floggings to which the poor slave is so often subjected It was the first and last attempt of Wiley to run away The long scars upon his back which he will carry with him to the grave perpetually remind him of the dangers of such a step There was not a day throughout the ten years I belonged to Epps that I did not consult with myself upon the prospect of escape I laid many plans which at the time I considered excellent ones but one after the other they were all abandoned No man who has never been placed in such a situation can comprehend the thousand obstacles thrown in the way of the flying slave Every white man's hand is raised against him the patrollers are watching for him the hounds are ready to follow on his track and the nature of the country is such as renders it impossible to pass through it with any safety I thought however that the time might come perhaps when I should be running through the swamps again I concluded in that chase to be prepared for Epps' dogs should they pursue me He possessed several one of which was a notorious slave hunter and the most fierce and savage of his breed While out hunting the coon or the opossum I never allowed an opportunity to escape when alone of whipping them severely In this manner I succeeded at length in subduing them completely They feared me obeying my voice at once when others had no control over them whatever Had they followed and overtaken me I doubt not they would have shrank from attacking me Notwithstanding the certainty of being captured the woods and swamps are nevertheless continually filled with runaways Many of them when sick or so worn out as to be unable to perform their tasks escape into the swamps willing to suffer the punishment inflicted for such offences in order to obtain a day or two of rest While I belonged to Ford I was unwittingly the means of disclosing the hiding place of six or eight who had taken up their residence in the Great Pine Woods Adam Taydem frequently sent me from the mills over to the opening after provisions The whole distance was then a thick pine forest About ten o'clock of a beautiful moonlight night while walking along the Texas road returning to the mills carrying a dressed pig in a bag swung over my shoulder I heard footsteps behind me and turning round beheld two black men in the dress of slaves approaching at a rapid pace When within a short distance one of them raised a club as if intending to strike me the other snatched at the bag I managed to dodge them both and seizing a pine knot hurled it with such force against the head of one of them that he was prostrated apparently senseless to the ground Just then two more made their appearance from one side of the road Before they could grapple me however I succeeded in passing them and taking to my heels fled much affrighted towards the mills When Adam was informed of the adventure he hastened straightway to the Indian village and arousing Cascalla and several of his tribe started in pursuit of the highwaymen I accompanied them to the scene of attack when we discovered a puddle of blood in the road where the man whom I had smitten with the pine knot had fallen After searching carefully through the woods a long time one of Cascalla's men discovered a smoke curling up through the branches of several prostrate pines whose tops had fallen together The rendezvous was cautiously surrounded and all of them taken prisoners They had escaped from a plantation in the vicinity of Lamourie and had been secreted there three weeks They had no evil design upon me except to frighten me out of my pig Having observed me passing towards Ford's just at night fall and suspecting the nature of my errand they had followed me seen me butcher and dress the porker and start on my return They had been pinched for food and were driven to this extremity by necessity Adam conveyed them to the parish jail and was liberally rewarded Not unfrequently the runaway loses his life in the attempt to escape Epps' premises were bounded on one side by Carey's a very extensive sugar plantation He cultivates annually at least fifteen hundred acres of cane manufacturing twenty two or twenty three hundred hogsheads of sugar an hogshead and a half being the usual yield of an acre Besides this he also cultivates five or six hundred acres of corn and cotton He owned last year one hundred and fifty three field hands besides nearly as many children and yearly hires a drove during the busy season from this side the Mississippi One of his negro drivers a pleasant intelligent boy was named Augustus During the holidays and occasionally while at work in adjoining fields I had an opportunity of making his acquaintance which eventually ripened into a warm and mutual attachment Summer before last he was so unfortunate as to incur the displeasure of the overseer a coarse heartless brute who whipped him most cruelly Augustus ran away Reaching a cane rick on Hawkins' plantation he secreted himself in the top of it All Carey's dogs were put upon his track some fifteen of them and soon scented his footsteps to the hiding place They surrounded the rick baying and scratching but could not reach him Presently guided by the clamor of the hounds the pursuers rode up when the overseer mounting on to the rick drew him forth As he rolled down to the ground the whole pack plunged upon him and before they could be beaten off had gnawed and mutilated his body in the most shocking manner their teeth having penetrated to the bone in an hundred places He was taken up tied upon a mule and carried home But this was Augustus' last trouble He lingered until the next day when death sought the unhappy boy and kindly relieved him from his agony It was not unusual for slave women as well as slave men to endeavor to escape Nelly Eldret's girl with whom I lumbered for a time in the Big Cane Brake lay concealed in Epps' corn crib three days At night when his family were asleep she would steal into the quarters for food and return to the crib again We concluded it would no longer be safe for us to allow her to remain and accordingly she retraced her steps to her own cabin But the most remarkable instance of a successful evasion of dogs and hunters was the following Among Carey's girls was one by the name of Celeste She was nineteen or twenty and far whiter than her owner or any of his offspring It required a close inspection to distinguish in her features the slightest trace of African blood A stranger would never have dreamed that she was the descendant of slaves I was sitting in my cabin late at night playing a low air on my violin when the door opened carefully and Celeste stood before me She was pale and haggard Had an apparition arisen from the earth I could not have been more startled Who are you I demanded after gazing at her a moment I'm hungry give me some bacon was her reply My first impression was that she was some deranged young mistress who escaping from home was wandering she knew not whither and had been attracted to my cabin by the sound of the violin The coarse cotton slave dress she wore however soon dispelled such a supposition What is your name I again interrogated My name is Celeste she answered I belong to Carey and have been two days among the palmettoes I am sick and can't work and would rather die in the swamp than be whipped to death by the overseer Carey's dogs won't follow me They have tried to set them on There's a secret between them and Celeste and they wont mind the devilish orders of the overseer Give me some meat I'm starving I divided my scanty allowance with her and while partaking of it she related how she had managed to escape and described the place of her concealment In the edge of the swamp not half a mile from Epps' house was as a large space thousands of acres in extent thickly covered with palmetto Tall trees whose long arms interlocked each other formed a canopy above them so dense as to exclude the beams of the sun It was like twilight always even in the middle of the brightest day In the centre of this great space which nothing but serpents very often explore a sombre and solitary spot Celeste had erected a rude hut of dead branches that had fallen to the ground and covered it with the leaves of the palmetto This was the abode she had selected She had no fear of Carey's dogs any more than I had of Epps' It is a fact which I have never been able to explain that there are those whose tracks the hounds will absolutely refuse to follow Celeste was one of them For several nights she came to my cabin for food On one occasion our dogs barked as she approached which aroused Epps and induced him to reconnoitre the premises He did not discover her but after that it was not deemed prudent for her to come to the yard When all was silent I carried provisions to a certain spot agreed upon where she would find them In this manner Celeste passed the greater part of the summer She regained her health and became strong and hearty At all seasons of the year the howlings of wild animals can be heard at night along the borders of the swamps Several times they had made her a midnight call awakening her from slumbers with a growl Terrified by such unpleasant salutations she finally concluded to abandon her lonely dwelling and accordingly returning to her master was scourged her neck meanwhile being fastened in the stocks and sent into the field again The year before my arrival in the country there was a concerted movement among a number of slaves on Bayou Boeuf that terminated tragically indeed It was I presume a matter of newspaper notoriety at the time but all the knowledge I have of it has been derived from the relation of those living at that period in the immediate vicinity of the excitement It has become a subject of general and unfailing interest in every slave hut on the bayou and will doubtless go down to succeeding generations as their chief tradition Lew Cheney with whom I became acquainted a shrewd cunning negro more intelligent than the generality of his race but unscrupulous and full of treachery conceived the project of organizing a company sufficiently strong to fight their way against all opposition to the neighboring territory of Mexico A remote spot far within the depths of the swamp back of Hawkins' plantation was selected as the rallying point Lew flitted from one plantation to another in the dead of night preaching a crusade to Mexico and like Peter the Hermit creating a furor of excitement wherever he appeared At length a large number of runaways were assembled stolen mules and corn gathered from the fields and bacon escaped from smoke houses had been conveyed into the woods The expedition was about ready to proceed when their hiding place was discovered Lew Cheney becoming convinced of the ultimate failure of his project in order to curry favor with his master and avoid the consequences which he foresaw would follow deliberately determined to sacrifice all his companions Departing secretly from the encampment he proclaimed among the planters the number collected in the swamp and instead of stating truly the object they had in view asserted their intention was to emerge from their seclusion the first favorable opportunity and murder every white person along the bayou Such an announcement exaggerated as it passed from mouth to mouth filled the whole country with terror The fugitives were surrounded and taken prisoners carried in chains to Alexandria and hung by the populace Not only those but many who were suspected though entirely innocent were taken from the field and from the cabin and without the shadow of process or form of trial hurried to the scaffold The planters on Bayou Boeuf finally rebelled against such reckless destruction of property but it was not until a regiment of soldiers had arrived from some fort on the Texan frontier demolished the gallows and opened the doors of the Alexandria prison that the indiscriminate slaughter was stayed Lew Cheney escaped and was even rewarded for his treachery He is still living but his name is despised and execrated by all his race throughout the parishes of Rapides and Avoyelles Such an idea as insurrection however is not new among the enslaved population of Bayou Boeuf More than once I have joined in serious consultation when the subject has been discussed and there have been times when a word from me would have placed hundreds of my fellow bondsmen in an attitude of defiance Without arms or ammunition or even with them I saw such a step would result in certain defeat disaster and death and always raised my voice against it During the Mexican war I well remember the extravagant hopes that were excited The news of victory filled the great house with rejoicing but produced only sorrow and disappointment in the cabin In my opinion and I have had opportunity to know something of the feeling of which I speak there are not fifty slaves on the shores of Bayou Boeuf but would hail with unmeasured delight the approach of an invading army They are deceived who flatter themselves that the ignorant and debased slave has no conception of the magnitude of his wrongs They are deceived who imagine that he arises from his knees with back lacerated and bleeding cherishing only a spirit of meekness and forgiveness A day may come it will come if his prayer is heard a terrible day of vengeance when the master in his turn will cry in vain for mercy XVIII O'NIEL THE TANNER CONVERSATION WITH AUNT PHEBE OVERHEARD EPPS IN THE TANNING BUSINESS STABBING OF UNCLE ABRAM THE UGLY WOUND EPPS IS JEALOUS PATSEY IS MISSING HER RETURN FROM SHAW'S HARRIET

of Master Epps as has been related in the preceding but in this respect he fared no worse than his unfortunate companions Spare the rod was an idea scouted by our master He was constitutionally subject to periods of ill humor and at such times however little provocation there might be a certain amount of punishment was inflicted The circumstances attending the last flogging but one that I received will show how trivial a cause was sufficient with him for resorting to the whip A Mr O'Niel residing in the vicinity of the Big Pine Woods called upon Epps for the purpose of purchasing me He was a tanner and currier by occupation transacting an extensive business and intended to place me at service in some department of his establishment provided he bought me Aunt Phebe while preparing the dinner table in the great house overheard their conversation On returning to the yard at night the old woman ran to meet me designing of course to overwhelm me with the news She entered into a minute repetition of all she had heard and Aunt Phebe was one whose ears never failed to drink in every word of conversation uttered in her hearing She enlarged upon the fact that Massa Epps was g'wine to sell me to a tanner ober in de Pine Woods so long and loudly as to attract the attention of the mistress who standing unobserved on the piazza at the time was listening to our conversation Well Aunt Phebe said I I'm glad of it I'm tired of scraping cotton and would rather be a tanner I hope he'll buy me O'Niel did not effect a purchase however the parties differing as to price and the morning following his arrival departed homewards He had been gone but a short time me when Epps made his appearance in the field Now nothing will more violently enrage a master especially Epps than the intimation of one of his servants that he would like to leave him Mistress Epps had repeated to him my expressions to Aunt Phebe the evening previous as I learned from the latter afterwards the mistress having mentioned to her that she had overheard us On entering the field Epps walked directly to me So Platt you're tired of scraping cotton are you You would like to change your master eh You're fond of moving round traveler ain't ye Ah yes like to travel for your health may be Feel above cotton scraping I 'spose So you're going into the tanning business Good business devilish fine business Enterprising nigger B'lieve I'll go into that business myself Down on your knees and strip that rag off your back I'll try my hand at tanning I begged earnestly and endeavored to soften him with excuses but in vain There was no other alternative so kneeling down I presented my bare back for the application of the lash How do you like tanning he exclaimed as the rawhide descended upon my flesh How do you like tanning he repeated at every blow In this manner he gave me twenty or thirty lashes incessantly giving utterance to the word tanning in one form of expression or another When sufficiently tanned he allowed me to arise and with a half malicious laugh assured me if I still fancied the business he would give me further instruction in it whenever I desired This time he remarked he had only given me a short lesson in tanning the next time he would curry me down Uncle Abram also was frequently treated with great brutality although he was one of the kindest and most faithful creatures in the world He was my cabin mate for years There was a benevolent expression in the old man's face pleasant to behold He regarded us with a kind of parental feeling always counseling us with remarkable gravity and deliberation Returning from Marshall's plantation one afternoon whither I had been sent on some errand of the mistress I found him lying on the cabin floor his clothes saturated with blood He informed me that he had been stabbed While spreading cotton on the scaffold Epps came home intoxicated from Holmesville He found fault with every thing giving many orders so directly contrary that it was impossible to execute any of them Uncle Abram whose faculties were growing dull became confused and committed some blunder of no particular consequence Epps was so enraged thereat that with drunken recklessness he flew upon the old man and stabbed him in the back It was a long ugly wound but did not happen to penetrate far enough to result fatally It was sewed up by the mistress who censured her husband with extreme severity not only denouncing his inhumanity but declaring that she expected nothing else than that he would bring the family to poverty that he would kill all the slaves on the plantation in some of his drunken fits It was no uncommon thing with him to prostrate Aunt Phebe with a chair or stick of wood but the most cruel whipping that ever I was doomed to witness one I can never recall with any other emotion than that of horror was inflicted on the unfortunate Patsey It has been seen that the jealousy and hatred of Mistress Epps made the daily life of her young and agile slave completely miserable I am happy in the belief that on numerous occasions I was the means of averting punishment from the inoffensive girl In Epps' absence the mistress often ordered me to whip her without the remotest provocation I would refuse saying that I feared my master's displeasure and several times ventured to remonstrate with her against the treatment Patsey received I endeavored to impress her with the truth that the latter was not responsible for the acts of which she complained but that she being a slave and subject entirely to her master's will he alone was answerable At length the green eyed monster crept into the soul of Epps also and then it was that he joined with his wrathful wife in an infernal jubilee over the girl's miseries On a Sabbath day in hoeing time not long ago we were on the bayou bank washing our clothes as was our usual custom Presently Patsey was missing Epps called aloud but there was no answer No one had observed her leaving the yard and it was a wonder with us whither she had gone In the course of a couple of hours she was seen approaching from the direction of Shaw's This man as has been intimated was a notorious profligate and withal not on the most friendly terms with Epps Harriet his wife knowing Patsey's troubles was kind to her in consequence of which the latter was in the habit of going over to see her every opportunity Her visits were prompted by friendship merely but the suspicion gradually entered the brain of Epps that another and a baser passion led her thither that it was not Harriet she desired to meet but rather the unblushing libertine his neighbor Patsey found her master in a fearful rage on her return His violence so alarmed her that at first she attempted to evade direct answers to hi his questions which only served to increase his suspicions She finally however drew herself up proudly and in a spirit of indignation boldly denied his charges Missus don't give me soap to wash with as she does the rest said Patsey and you know why I went over to Harriet's to get a piece and saying this she drew it forth from a pocket in her dress and exhibited it to him That's what I went to Shaw's for Massa Epps continued she the Lord knows that was all You lie you black wench shouted Epps I don't lie massa If you kill me I'll stick to that Oh I'll fetch you down I'll learn you to go to Shaw's I'll take the starch out of ye he muttered fiercely through his shut teeth Then turning to me he ordered four stakes to be driven into the ground pointing with the toe of his boot to the places where he wanted them When the stakes were driven down he ordered her to be stripped of every article of dress Ropes were then brought and the naked girl was laid upon her face her wrists and feet each tied firmly to a stake Stepping to the piazza he took down a heavy whip and placing it in my hands commanded me to lash her Unpleasant as it was I was compelled to obey him Nowhere that day on the face of the whole earth I venture to say was there such a demoniac exhibition witnessed as then ensued Mistress Epps stood on the piazza among her children gazing on the scene with an air of heartless satisfaction The slaves were huddled together at a little distance their countenances indicating the sorrow of their hearts Poor Patsey prayed piteously for mercy but her prayers were vain Epps ground his teeth and stamped upon the ground screaming at me like a mad fiend to strike harder Strike harder or your turn will come next you scoundrel he yelled Oh mercy massa oh have mercy do Oh God pity me Patsey exclaimed continually struggling fruitlessly and the flesh quivering at every stroke When I had struck her as many as thirty times I stopped and turned round toward Epps hoping he was satisfied but with bitter oaths and threats he ordered me to continue I inflicted ten or fifteen blows more By this time her back was covered with long welts intersecting each other like net work Epps was yet furious and savage as ever demanding if she would like to go to Shaw's again and swearing he would flog her until she wished she was in h l Throwing down the whip I declared I could punish her no more He ordered me to go on threatening me with a severer flogging than she had received in case of refusal My heart revolted at the inhuman scene and risking the consequences I absolutely refused to raise the whip He then seized it himself and applied it with ten fold greater force than I had The painful cries and shrieks of the tortured Patsey mingling with the loud and angry curses of Epps loaded the air She was terribly lacerated I may say without exaggeration literally flayed The lash was wet with blood which flowed down her sides and dropped upon the ground At length she ceased struggling Her head sank listlessly on the ground Her screams and supplications gradually decreased and died away into a low moan She no longer writhed and shrank beneath the lash when it bit out small pieces of her flesh I thought that she was dying It was the Sabbath of the Lord The fields smiled in the warm sunlight the birds chirped merrily amidst the foliage of the trees peace and happiness seemed to reign everywhere save in the bosoms of Epps and his panting victim and the silent witnesses around him The tempestuous emotions that were raging there were little in harmony with the calm and quiet beauty of the day I could look on Epps only with unutterable loathing and abhorrence and thought within myself Thou devil sooner or later somewhere in the course of eternal justice thou shalt answer for this sin Finally he ceased whipping from mere exhaustion and ordered Phebe to bring a bucket of salt and water After washing her thoroughly with this I was told to take her to her cabin Untying the ropes I raised her in my arms She was unable to stand and as her head rested on my shoulder she repeated many times in a faint voice scarcely perceptible Oh Platt oh Platt but nothing further Her dress was replaced but it clung to her back and was soon stiff with blood We laid her on some boards in the hut where she remained a long time with eyes closed and groaning in agony At night Phebe applied melted tallow to her wounds and so far as we were able all endeavored to assist and console her Day after day she lay in her cabin upon her face the sores preventing her resting in any other position A blessed thing it would have been for her days and weeks and months of misery it would have saved her had she never lifted up her head in life again Indeed from that time forward she was not what she had been The burden of a deep melancholy weighed heavily on her spirits She no longer moved with that buoyant and elastic step there was not that mirthful sparkle in her eyes that formerly distinguished her The bounding vigor the sprightly laughter loving spirit of her youth were gone She fell into a mournful and desponding mood and often times would start up in her sleep and with raised hands plead for mercy She became more silent than she was toiling all day in our midst not uttering a word A care worn pitiful expression settled on her face and it was her humor now to weep rather than rejoice If ever there was a broken heart one crushed and blighted by the rude grasp of suffering misfortune it was Patsey's She had been reared no better than her master's beast looked upon merely as a valuable and handsome animal and consequently possessed but a limited amount of knowledge And yet a faint light cast its rays over her intellect so that it was not wholly dark She had a dim perception of God and of eternity and a still more dim perception of a Saviour who had died even for such as her She entertained but confused notions of a future life not comprehending the distinction between the corporeal and spiritual existence Happiness in her mind was exemption from stripes from labor from the cruelty of masters and overseers Her idea of the joy of heaven was simply rest and is fully expressed in these of a melancholy bard I ask no paradise on high With cares on earth oppressed The only heaven for which I sigh Is rest eternal rest It is a mistaken opinion that prevails in some quarters that the slave does not understand the term does not comprehend the idea of freedom Even on Bayou Boeuf where I conceive slavery exists in its most abject and cruel form where it exhibits features altogether unknown in more northern States the most ignorant of them generally know full well its meaning They understand the privileges and exemptions that belong to it that it would bestow upon them the fruits of their own labors and that it would secure to them the enjoyment of domestic happiness They do not fail to observe the difference between their own condition and the meanest white man's and to realize the injustice of the laws which place it in his power not only to appropriate the profits of their industry but to subject them to unmerited and unprovoked punishment without remedy or the right to resist or to remonstrate Patsey's life especially after her whipping was one long dream of liberty Far away to her fancy an immeasurable distance she knew there was a land of freedom A thousand times she had heard that somewhere in the distant North there were no slaves no masters In her imagination it was an enchanted region the Paradise of the earth To dwell where the black man may work for himself live in his own cabin till his own soil was a blissful dream of Patsey's a dream alas the fulfillment of which she can never realize The effect of these exhibitions of brutality on the household of the slave holder is apparent Epps' oldest son is an intelligent lad of ten or twelve years of age It is pitiable sometimes to see him chastising for instance the venerable Uncle Abram He will call the old man to account and if in his childish judgement it is necessary sentence him to a certain number of lashes which he proceeds to inflict with much gravity and deliberation Mounted on his pony he often rides into the field with his whip playing the overseer greatly to his father's delight Without discrimination at such times he applies the rawhide urging the slaves forward with shouts and occasional expressions of profanity while the old man laughs and commends him as a thorough going boy The child is father to the man and with such training whatever may be his natural disposition it cannot well be otherwise than that on arriving at maturity the sufferings and miseries of the slave will be looked upon with entire indifference The influence of the iniquitous system necessarily fosters an unfeeling and cruel spirit even in the bosoms of those who among their equals are regarded as humane and generous Young Master Epps possessed some noble qualities yet no process of reasoning could lead him to comprehend that in the eye of the Almighty there is no distinction of color He looked upon the black man simply as an animal differing in no respect from any other animal save in the gift of speech and the possession of somewhat higher instincts and therefore the more valuable To work like his father's mules to be whipped and kicked and scourged through life to address the white man with hat in hand and eyes bent servilely on the earth in his mind was the natural and proper destiny of the slave Brought up with such ideas in the notion that we stand without the pale of humanity no wonder the oppressors of my people are a pitiless and unrelenting race XIX AVERY ON BAYOU ROUGE PECULIARITY OF DWELLINGS EPPS BUILDS A NEW HOUSE BASS THE CARPENTER HIS NOBLE QUALITIES HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND ECCENTRICITIES BASS AND EPPS DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF SLAVERY EPPS' OPINION OF BASS I MAKE MYSELF KNOWN TO HIM OUR CONVERSATION HIS SURPRISE THE MIDNIGHT MEETING ON THE BAYOU BANK BASS' ASSURANCES DECLARES WAR AGAINST SLAVERY WHY I DID NOT DISCLOSE MY HISTORY BASS WRITES LETTERS COPY OF HIS LETTER TO MESSRS PARKER AND PERRY THE FEVER OF SUSPENSE DISAPPOINTMENTS BASS ENDEAVORS TO CHEER ME MY FAITH IN HIM IN the month of June in pursuance of a previous contract Mr Avery a carpenter of Bayou Rouge commenced the erection of a house for Master Epps It has previously been stated that there are no cellars on Bayou Boeuf on the other hand such is the low and swampy nature of the ground the great houses are usually built upon spiles Another peculiarity is the rooms are not plastered but the ceiling and sides are covered with matched cypress boards painted such color as most pleases the owner's taste Generally the plank and boards are sawed by slaves with whip saws there being no waterpower upon which mills might be built within many miles When the planter erects for himself a dwelling therefore there is plenty of extra work for his slaves Having had some experience under Tibeats as a carpenter I was taken from the field altogether on the arrival of Avery and his hands Among them was one to whom I owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude Only for him in all probability I should have ended my days in slavery He was my deliverer a man whose true heart overflowed with noble and generous emotions To the last moment of my existence I shall remember him with feelings of thankfulness His name was Bass and at that time he resided in Marksville It will be difficult to convey a correct impression of his appearance or character He was a large man between forty and fifty years old of light complexion and light hair He was very cool and self possessed fond of argument but always speaking with extreme deliberation He was that kind of person whose peculiarity of manner was such that nothing he uttered ever gave offence What would be intolerable coming from the lips of another could be said by him with impunity There was not a man on Red River perhaps that agreed with him on the subject of politics or religion and not a man I venture to say who discussed either of those subjects half as much It seemed to be taken for granted that he would espouse the unpopular side of every local question and it always created amusement rather than displeasure among his auditors to listen to the ingenious and original manner in which he maintained the controversy He was a bachelor an old bachelor according to the true acceptation of the term having no kindred living as he knew of in the world Neither had he any permanent abiding place wandering from one State to another as his fancy dictated He had lived in Marksville three or four years and in the prosecution of his business as a carpenter and in consequence likewise of his peculiarities was quite extensively known throughout the parish of Avoyelles He was liberal to a fault and his many acts of kindness and transparent goodness of heart rendered him popular in the community the sentiment of which he unceasingly combated He was a native of Canada from whence he had wandered in early life and after visiting all the principal localities in the northern and western States in the course of his peregrinations arrived in the unhealthy region of the Red River His last removal was from Illinois Whither he has now gone I regret to be obliged to say is unknown to me He gathered up his effects and departed quietly from Marksville the day before I did the suspicions of his instrumentality in procuring my liberation rendering such a step necessary For the commission of a just and righteous act he would undoubtedly have suffered death had he remained within reach of the slavewhipping tribe on Bayou Boeuf One day while working on the new house Bass and Epps became engaged in a controversy to which as will be readily supposed I listened with absorbing interest They were discussing the subject of Slavery I tell you what it is Epps said Bass it's all wrong all wrong sir there's no justice nor righteousness in it I wouldn't own a slave if I was rich as Croesus which I am not as is perfectly well understood more particularly among my creditors There's another humbug the credit system humbug sir no credit no debt Credit leads a man into temptation Cash down is the only thing that will deliver him from evil But this question of Slavery what right have you to your niggers when you come down to the point What right said Epps laughing why I bought 'em and paid for 'em Of course you did the law says you have the right to hold a nigger but begging the law's pardon it lies Yes Epps when the law says that it's a liar and the truth is not in it Is every thing right because the law allows it Suppose they'd pass a law taking away your liberty and making you a slave Oh that ain't a supposable case said Epps still laughing hope you don't compare me to a nigger Bass Well Bass answered gravely no not exactly But I have seen niggers before now as good as I am and I have no acquaintance with any white man in these parts that I consider a whit better than myself Now in the sight of God what is the difference Epps between a white man and a black one All the difference in the world replied Epps You might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon Now I've seen one of them critters in Orleans that knowed just as much as any nigger I've got You'd call them feller citizens I s'pose and Epps indulged in a loud laugh at his own wit Look here Epps continued his companion you can't laugh me down in that way Some men are witty and some ain't so witty as they think they are Now let me ask you a question Are all men created free and equal as the Declaration of Independence holds they are Yes responded Epps but all men niggers and monkeys ain't and hereupon he broke forth into a more boisterous laugh than before There are monkeys among white people as well as black when you come to that coolly remarked Bass I know some white men that use arguments no sensible monkey would But let that pass These niggers are human beings If they don't know as much as their masters whose fault is it They are not allowed to know anything You have books and papers and can go where you please and gather intelligence in a thousand ways But your slaves have no privileges You'd whip one of them if caught reading a book They are held in bondage generation after generation deprived of mental improvement and who can expect them to possess much knowledge If they are not brought down to a level with the brute creation you slaveholders will never be blamed for it If they are baboons or stand no higher in the scale of intelligence than such animals you and men like you will have to answer for it There's a sin a fearful sin resting on this nation that will not go unpunished forever There will be a reckoning yet yes Epps there's a day coming that will burn as an oven It may be sooner or it may be later but it's a coming as sure as the Lord is just If you lived up among the Yankees in New England said Epps I expect you'd be one of them cursed fanatics that know more than the constitution and go about peddling clocks and coaxing niggers to run away If I was in New England returned Bass I would be just what I am here I would say that Slavery was an iniquity and ought to be abolished I would say there was no reason nor justice in the law or the constitution that allows one man to hold another man in bondage It would be hard for you to lose your property to be sure but it wouldn't be half as hard as it would be to lose your liberty You have no more right to your freedom in exact justice than Uncle Abram yonder Talk about black skin and black blood why how many slaves are there on this bayou as white as either of us And what difference is there in the color of the soul Pshaw the whole system is as absurd as it is cruel You may own niggers and behanged but I wouldn't own one for the best plantation in Louisiana You like to hear yourself talk Bass better than any man I know of You would argue that black was white or white black if any body would contradict you Nothing suits you in this world and I don't believe you will be satisfied with the next if you should have your choice in them Conversations substantially like the foregoing were not unusual between the two after this Epps drawing him out more for the purpose of creating a laugh at his expense than with a view of fairly discussing the merits of the question He looked upon Bass as a man ready to say anything merely for the pleasure of hearing his own voice as somewhat self conceited perhaps contending against his faith and judgment in order simply to exhibit his dexterity in argumentation He remained at Epps through the summer visiting Marksville generally once a fortnight The more I saw of him the more I became convinced he was a man in whom I could confide Nevertheless my previous ill fortune had taught me to be extremely cautious It was not my place to speak to a white man except when spoken to but I omitted no opportunity of throwing myself in his way and endeavored constantly in every possible manner to attract his attention In the early part of August he and myself were at work alone in the house the other carpenters having left and Epps being absent in the field Now was the time if ever to broach the subject and I resolved to do it and submit to whatever consequences might ensue We were busily at work in the afternoon when I stopped suddenly and said Master Bass I want to ask you what part of the country you came from Why Platt what put that into your head he answered You wouldn't know if I should tell you After a moment or two he added I was born in Canada now guess where that is Oh I know where Canada is said I I have been there myself Yes I expect you are well acquainted all through that country he remarked laughing incredulously As sure as I live Master Bass I replied I have been there I have been in Montreal and Kingston and Queenston and a great many places in Canada and I have been in York State too in Buffalo and Rochester and Albany and can tell you the names of the villages on the Erie canal and the Champlain canal Bass turned round and gazed at me a long time without uttering a syllable How came you here he inquired at length Master Bass I answered if justice had been done I never would have been here Well how's this said he Who are you You have been in Canada sure enough I know all the places you mention How did you happen to get here Come tell me all about it I have no friends here was my reply that I can put confidence in I am afraid to tell you though I don't believe you would tell Master Epps if I should He assured me earnestly he would keep every word I might speak to him a profound secret and his curiosity was evidently strongly excited It was a long story I informed him and would take some time to relate it Master Epps would be back soon but if he would see me that night after all were asleep I would repeat it to him He consented readily to the arrangement and directed me to come into the building where we were then at work and I would find him there About midnight when all was still and quiet I crept cautiously from my cabin and silently entering the unfinished building found him awaiting me After further assurances on his part that I should not be betrayed I began a relation of the history of my life and misfortunes He was deeply interested asking numerous questions in reference to localities and events Having ended my story I besought him to write to some of my friends at the North acquainting them with my situation and begging them to forward free papers or take such steps as they might consider proper to secure my release He promised to do so but dwelt upon the danger of such an act in case of detection and now impressed upon me the great necessity of strict silence and secresy Before we parted our plan of operation was arranged We agreed to meet the next night at a specified place among the high weeds on the bank of the bayou some distance from master's dwelling There he was write down on paper the names and address of several persons old friends in the North to whom he would direct letters during his next visit to Marksville It was not deemed prudent to meet in the new house inasmuch as the light it would be necessary to use might possibly be discovered In the course of the day I managed to obtain a few matches and a piece of candle unperceived from the kitchen during a temporary absence of Aunt Phebe Bass had pencil and paper in his tool chest At the appointed hour we met on the bayou bank and creeping among the high weeds I lighted the candle while he drew forth pencil and paper and prepared for business I gave him the names of William Perry Cephas Parker and Judge Marvin all of Saratoga Springs Saratoga county New York I had been employed by the latter in the United States Hotel and had transacted business with the former to a considerable extent and trusted that at least one of them would be still living at that place He carefully wrote the names and then remarked thoughtfully It is so many years since you left Saratoga all these men may be dead or may have removed You say you obtained papers at the custom house in New York Probably there is a record of them there and I think it would be well to write and ascertain I agreed with him and again repeated the circumstances related heretofore connected with my visit to the custom house with Brown and Hamilton We lingered on the bank of the bayou an hour or more conversing upon the subject which now engrossed our thoughts I could no longer doubt his fidelity and freely spoke to him of the many sorrows I had borne in silence and so long I spoke of my wife and children mentioning their names and ages and dwelling upon the unspeakable happiness it would be to clasp them to my heart once more before I died I caught him by the hand and with tears and passionate entreaties implored him to befriend me to restore me to my kindred and to liberty promising I would weary Heaven the remainder of my life with prayers that it would bless and prosper him In the enjoyment of freedom surrounded by the associations of youth and restored to the bosom of my family that promise is not yet forgotten nor shall it ever be so long as I have strength to raise my imploring eyes on high Oh blessings on his kindly voice and on his silver hair And blessings on his whole life long until he meet me there He overwhelmed me with assurances of friendship and faithfulness saying he had never before taken so deep an interest in the fate of any one He spoke of himself in a somewhat mournful tone as a lonely man a wanderer about the world that he was growing old and must soon reach the end of his earthly journey and lie down to his final rest without kith or kin to mourn for him or to remember him that his life was of little value to himself and henceforth should be devoted to the accomplishment of my liberty and to an unceasing warfare against the accursed shame of Slavery After this time we seldom spoke to or recognized each other He was moreover less free in his conversation with Epps on the subject of Slavery The remotest suspicion that there was any unusual intimacy any secret understanding between us never once entered the mind of Epps or any other person white or black on the plantation I am often asked with an air of incredulity how I succeeded so many years in keeping from my daily and constant companions the knowledge of my true name and history The terrible lesson Burch taught me impressed indelibly upon my mind the danger and uselessness of asserting I was a freeman There was no possibility of any slave being able to assist me while on the other hand there was a possibility of his exposing me When it is recollected the whole current of my thoughts for twelve years turned to the contemplation of escape it will not be wondered at that I was always cautious and on my guard It would have been an act of folly to have proclaimed my right to freedom it would only have subjected me to severer scrutiny probably have consigned me to some more distant and inaccessible region than even Bayou Boeuf Edwin Epps was a person utterly regardless of a black man's rights or wrongs utterly destitute of any natural sense of justice as I well knew It was important therefore not only as regarded my hope of deliverance but also as regarded the few personal priviliges I was as permitted to enjoy to keep from him the history of my life The Saturday night subsequent to our interview at the water's edge Bass went home to Marksville The next day being Sunday he employed himself in his own room writing letters One he directed to the Collector of Customs at New York another to Judge Marvin and another to Messrs Parker and Perry jointly The latter was the one which led to my recovery He subscribed my true name but in the postscript intimated I was not the writer The letter itself shows that he considered himself engaged in a dangerous undertaking no less than running the risk of his life if detected I did not see the letter before it was mailed but have since obtained a copy which is here inserted Bayou Boeuf August Mr WILLIAM PERRY or Mr CEPHAS PARKER Gentlemen It having been a long time since I have seen or heard from you and not knowing that you are living it is with uncertainty that I write to you but the necessity of the case must be my excuse Having been born free just across the river from you I am certain you must know me and I am here now a slave I wish you to obtain free papers for me and forward them to me at Marksville Louisiana Parish of Avoyelles and oblige Yours SOLOMON NORTHUP The way I came to be a slave I was taken sick in Washington City and was insensible for some time When I recovered my reason I was robbed of my free papers and in irons on my way to this State and have never been able to get any one to write for me until now and he that is writing for me runs the risk of his life if detected The allusion to myself in the work recently issued entitled A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin contains the first part of this letter omitting the postscript Neither are the full names of the gentlemen to whom it is directed correctly stated there being a slight discrepancy probably a typographical error To the postscript more than to the body of the communication am I indebted for my liberation as will presently be seen When Bass returned from Marksville he informed me of what he had done We continued our midnight consultations never speaking to each other through the day excepting as it was necessary about the work As nearly as he was able to ascertain it would require two weeks for the letter to reach Saratoga in due course of mail and the same length of time for an answer to return Within six weeks at the farthest we concluded an answer would arrive if it arrived at all A great many suggestions were now made and a great deal of conversation took place between us as to the most safe and proper course to pursue on receipt of the free papers They would stand between him and harm in case we were overtaken and arrested leaving the country altogether It would be no infringement of law however much it might provoke individual hostility to assist a freeman to regain his freedom At the end of four weeks he was again at Marksville but no answer had arrived I was sorely disappointed but still reconciled myself with the reflection that sufficient length of time had not yet elapsed that there might have been delays and that I could not reasonably expect one so soon Six seven eight and ten weeks passed by however and nothing came I was in a fever of suspense whenever Bass visited Marksville and could scarcely close my eyes until his return Finally my master's house was finished and the time came when Bass must leave me The night before his departure I was wholly given up to despair I had clung to him as a drowning man clings to the floating spar knowing if it ships from his grasp he must forever sink beneath the waves The all glorious hope upon which I had laid such eager hold was crumbling to ashes in my hands I felt as if sinking down down amidst the bitter waters of Slavery from the unfathomable depths of which I should never rise again The generous heart of my friend and benefactor was touched with pity at the sight of my distress He endeavored to cheer me up promising to return the day before Christmas and if no intelligence was received in the meantime some further step would be undertaken to effect our design He exhorted me to keep up my spirits to rely upon his continued efforts in my behalf assuring me in most earnest and impressive language that my liberation should from thenceforth be the chief object of his thoughts In his absence the time passed slowly indeed I looked forward to Christmas with intense anxiety and impatience I had about given up the expectation of receiving any answer to the letters They might have miscarried or might have been misdirected Perhaps those at Saratoga to whom they had been addressed were all dead perhaps engaged in their pursuits they did not consider the fate of an obscure unhappy black man of sufficient importance to be noticed My whole reliance was in Bass The faith I had in him was continually re assuring me and enabled me to stand up against the tide of disappointment that had overwhelmed me So wholly was I absorbed in reflecting upon my situation and prospects that the hands with whom I labored in the field often observed it Patsey would ask me if I was sick and Uncle Abram and Bob and Wiley frequently expressed a curiosity to know what I could be thinking about so steadily But I evaded their inquiries with some light remark and kept my thoughts locked closely in my breast XX BASS FAITHFUL TO HIS WORD HIS ARRIVAL ON CHRISTMAS EVE THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING AN INTERVIEW THE MEETING IN THE CABIN NON ARRIVAL OF THE LETTER BASS ANNOUNCES HIS INTENTION TO PROCEED NORTH CHRISTMAS CONVERSATION BETWEEN EPPS AND BASS YOUNG MISTRESS M'COY THE BEAUTY OF BAYOU BOEUF THE NE PLUS ULTRA OF DINNERS MUSIC AND DANCING PRESENCE OF THE MISTRESS HER EXCEEDING BEAUTY THE LAST SLAVE DANCE WILLIAM PIERCE OVERSLEEP MYSELF THE LAST WHIPPING DESPONDENCY THE COLD MORNING EPPS' THREATS THE PASSING CARRIAGE STRANGERS APPROACHING THROUGH THE COTTON FIELD LAST HOUR ON BAYOU BOEUF FAITHFUL to his word the day before Christmas just at night fall Bass came riding into the yard How are you said Epps shaking him by the hand glad to see you He would not have been very glad had he known the object of his errand Quite well quite well answered Bass Had some business out on the bayou and concluded to call and see you and stay over night Epps ordered one of the slaves to take charge of his horse and with much talk and laughter they passed into the house together not however until Bass had looked at me significantly as much as to say Keep dark we understand each other It was ten o'clock at night before the labors of the day were performed when I entered the cabin At that time Uncle Abram and Bob occupied it with me I laid down upon my board and feigned I was asleep When my companions had fallen into a profound slumber I moved stealthily out of the door and watched and listened attentively for some sign or sound from Bass There I stood until long after midnight but nothing could be seen or heard As I suspected he dared not leave the house through fear of exciting the suspicion of some of the family I judged correctly he would rise earlier than was his custom and take the opportunity of seeing me before Epps was up Accordingly I aroused Uncle Abram an hour sooner than usual and sent him into the house to build a fire which at that season of the year is a part of Uncle Abram's duties I also gave Bob a violent shake and asked him if he intended to sleep till noon saying master would be up before the mules were fed He knew right well the consequence that would follow such an event and jumping to his feet was at the horse pasture in a twinkling Presently when both were gone Bass slipped into the cabin No letter yet Platt said he The announcement fell upon my heart like lead Oh do write again Master Bass I cried I will give you the names of a great many I know Surely they are not all dead Surely some one will pity me No use Bass replied no use I have made up my mind to that I fear the Marksville post master will mistrust something I have inquired so often at his office Too uncertain too dangerous Then it is all over I exclaimed Oh my God how can I end my days here You're not going to end them here he said unless you die very soon I've thought this matter all have come to a determination There are more ways than one to manage this business and a better and surer way than writing letters I have a job or two on hand which can be completed by March or April By that time I shall have a considerable sum of money and then Platt I am going to Saratoga myself I could scarcely credit my own senses as the words fell from his lips But he assured me in a manner that left no doubt of the sincerity of his intention that if his life was spared until spring he should certainly undertake the journey I have lived in this region long enough he considered I may as well be in one place as another For a long time I have been thinking of going back more to the place where I was born I'm tired of Slavery as well as you If I can succeed in getting you away from here it will be a good act that I shall like to think of all my life And I shall succeed Platt I'm bound to do it Now let me tell you what I want Epps will be up soon and it won't do to be caught here Think of a great many men at Saratoga and Sandy Hill and in that neighborhood who once knew you I shall make excuse to come here again in the course of the winter when I will write down their names I will then know who to call on when I go north Think of all you can Cheer up Don't be discouraged I'm with you life or death Good bye God bless you and saying this he left the cabin quickly and entered the great house It was Christmas morning the happiest day in the whole year for the slave That morning he need not hurry to the field with his gourd and cotton bag Happiness sparkled in the eyes and overspread the countenances of all The time of feasting and dancing had come The cane and cotton fields were deserted That day the clean dress was to be donned the red ribbon displayed there were to be re unions and joy and laughter and hurrying to and fro It was to be a day of liberty among the children of Slavery Wherefore they were happy and rejoiced After breakfast Epps and Bass sauntered about the yard conversing upon the price of cotton and various other topics Where do your niggers hold Christmas Bass inquired Platt is going to Tanners to day His fiddle is in great demand They want him at Marshall's Monday and Miss Mary McCoy on the old Norwood plantation writes me a note that she wants him to play for her niggers Tuesday He is rather a smart boy ain't he said Bass Come here Platt he added looking at me as I walked up to them as if he had never thought before to take any special notice of me Yes replied Epps taking hold of my arm and feeling it there isn't a bad joint in him There ain't a boy on the bayou worth more than he is perfectly sound and no bad tricks D n him he isn't like other niggers doesn't look like 'em don't act like 'em I was offered seventeen hundred dollars for him last week And didn't take it Bass inquired with an air of surprise Take it no devilish clear of it Why he's a reg'lar genius can make a plough beam wagon tongue anything as well as you can Marshall wanted to put up one of his niggers agin him and raffle for them but I told him I would see the devil have him first I don't see anything remarkable about him Bass observed Why just feel of him no Epps rejoined You don't see a boy very often put together any closer than he is He's a thin skin'd cuss and won't bear as much whipping as some but he's got the muscle in him and no mistake Bass felt of me turned me round and made a thorough examination Epps all the while dwelling on my good points But his visitor seemed to take but little interest finally in the subject and consequently it was dropped Bass soon departed giving me another sly look of recognition and significance as he trotted out of the yard When he was gone I obtained a pass and started for Tanner's not Peter Tanner's of whom mention has previously been made but a relative of his I played during the day and most of the night spending the next day Sunday in my cabin Monday I crossed the bayou to Douglas Marshall's all Epps' slaves accompanying me and on Tuesday went to the old Norwood place which is the third plantation above Marshall's on the same side of the water This estate is now owned by Miss Mary McCoy a lovely girl some twenty years of age She is the beauty and the glory of Bayou Bouef She owns about a hundred working hands besides a great many house servants yard boys and young children Her brother in law who resides on the adjoining estate is her general agent She is beloved by all her slaves and good reason indeed have they to be thankful that they have fallen into such gentle hands Nowhere on the bayou are there such feasts such merrymaking as at young Madam McCoy's Thither more than to any other place do the old and the young for miles around love to repair in the time of the Christmas holiday for nowhere else can they find such delicious repasts nowhere else can they hear a voice speaking to them so pleasantly No one is so well beloved no one fills so large a space in the hearts of a thousand slaves as young Madam McCoy the orphan mistress of the old Norwood estate On my arrival at her place I found two or three hundred had assembled The table was prepared in a long building which she had erected expressly for her slaves to dance in It was covered with every variety of food the country afforded and was pronounced by general acclamation to be the rarest of dinners Roast turkey pig chicken duck and all kinds of meat baked boiled and broiled formed a line the whole length of the extended table while the vacant spaces were filled with tarts jellies and frosted cake and pastry of many kinds The young mistress walked around the table smiling and saying a kind word to each one and seemed to enjoy the scene exceedingly When the dinner was over the tables were removed to make room for the dancers I tuned my violin and struck up a lively air while some joined in a nimble reel others patted and sang their simple but melodious songs filling the great room with music mingled with the sound of human voices and the clatter of many feet In the evening the mistress returned and stood in the door a long time looking at us She was magnificently arrayed Her dark hair and eyes contrasted strongly with her clear and delicate complexion Her form was slender but commanding and her movement was a combination of unaffected dignity and grace As she stood there clad in her rich apparel her face animated with pleasure I thought I had never looked upon a human being half so beautiful I dwell with delight upon the description of this fair and gentle lady not only because she inspired me with emotions of gratitude and admiration but because I would have the reader understand that all slave owners on Bayou Boeuf are not like Epps or Tibeats or Jim Burns Occasionally can be found rarely it may be indeed a good man like William Ford or an angel of kindness like young Mistress McCoy Tuesday concluded the three holidays Epps yearly allowed us On my way home Wednesday morning while passing the plantation of William Pierce that gentleman hailed me saying he had received a line from Epps brought down by William Varnell permitting him to detain me for the purpose of playing for his slaves that night It was the last time I was destined to witness a slave dance on the shores of Bayou Boeuf The party at Pierce's continued their jollification until broad daylight when I returned to my master's house somewhat wearied with the loss of rest but rejoicing in the possession of numerous bits and picayunes which the whites who were pleased with my musical performances had contributed On Saturday morning for the first time in years I overslept myself I was frightened on coming out of the cabin to find the slaves were already in the field They had preceded me some fifteen minutes Leaving my dinner and water gourd I hurried after them as fast as I could move It was not yet sunrise but Epps was on the piazza as I left the hut and cried out to me that it was a pretty time of day to be getting up By extra exertion my row was up when he came out after breakfast This however was no excuse for the offence of oversleeping Bidding me strip and lie down he gave me ten or fifteen lashes at the conclusion of which he inquired if I thought after that I could get up sometime in the morning I expressed myself quite positively that I could and with back stinging with pain went about my work The following day Sunday my thoughts were upon Bass and the probabilities and hopes which hung upon his action and determination I considered the uncertainty of life that if it should be the will of God that he should die my prospect of deliverance and all expectation of happiness in this world would be wholly ended and destroyed My sore back perhaps did not have a tendency to render me unusually cheerful I felt down hearted and unhappy all day long and when I laid down upon the hard board at night my heart was oppressed with such a load of grief it seemed that it must break Monday morning the third of January we were in the field betimes It was a raw cold morning such as is unusual in that region I was in advance Uncle Abram next to me behind him Bob Patsey and Wiley with our cotton bags about our necks Epps happened a rare thing indeed to come out that morning without his whip He swore in a manner that would shame a pirate that we were doing nothing Bob ventured to say that his fingers were so numb with cold he couldn't pick fast Epps cursed himself for not having brought his rawhide and declared that when he came out again he would warm us well yes he would make us all hotter than that fiery realm in which I am sometimes compelled to believe he will himself eventually reside With these fervent expressions he left us When out of hearing we commenced talking to each other saying how hard it was to be compelled to keep up our tasks with numb fingers how unreasonable master was and speaking of him generally in no flattering terms Our conversation was interrupted by a carriage passing rapidly towards the house Looking up we saw two men approaching us through the cotton field Having now brought down this narrative to the last hour I was to spend on Bayou Boeuf having gotten through my last cotton picking and about to bid Master Epps farewell I must beg the reader to go back with me to the month of August to follow Bass' letter on its long journey to Saratoga to learn the effect it produced and that while I was repining and despairing in the slave hut of Edwin Epps through the friendship of Bass and the goodness of Providence all things were working together for my deliverance XXI THE LETTER REACHES SARATOGA IS FORWARDED TO ANNE IS LAID BEFORE HENRY B NORTHUP THE STATUTE OF MAY ITS PROVISIONS ANNE'S MEMORIAL TO THE GOVERNOR THE AFFIDAVITS ACCOMPANYING IT SENATOR SOULE'S LETTER DEPARTURE OF THE AGENT APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR ARRIVAL AT MARKSVILLE THE HON JOHN P WADDILL THE CONVERSATION ON NEW YORK POLITICS IT SUGGESTS A FORTUNATE IDEA THE MEETING WITH BASS THE SECRET OUT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED DEPARTURE OF NORTHUP AND THE SHERIFF FROM MARKSVILLE FOR BAYOU BOEUF ARRANGEMENTS ON THE WAY REACH EPPS' PLANTATION DISCOVER HIS SLAVES IN THE COTTON FIELD THE MEETING THE FAREWELL I AM indebted to Mr Henry B Northup and others for many of the particulars contained in this The letter written by Bass directed to Parker and Perry and which was deposited in the post office in Marksville on the th day of August arrived at Saratoga in the early part of September Some time previous to this Anne had removed to Glens Falls Warren county where she had charge of the kitchen in Carpenter's Hotel She kept house however lodging with our children and was only absent from them during such time as the discharge of her duties in the hotel required Messrs Parker and Perry on receipt of the letter forwarded it immediately to Anne On reading it the children were all excitement and without delay hastened to the neighboring village of Sandy Hill to consult Henry B Northup and obtain his advice and assistance in the matter Upon examination that gentleman found among the statutes of the State an act providing for the recovery of free citizens from slavery It was passed May and is entitled An act more effectually to protect the free citizens of this State from being kidnapped or reduced to slavery It provides that it shall be the duty of the Governor upon the receipt of satisfactory information that any free citizen or inhabitant of this State is wrongfully held in another State or Territory of the United States upon the allegation or pretence that such person is a slave or by color of any usage or rule of law is deemed or taken to be a slave to take such measures to procure the restoration of such person to liberty as he shall deem necessary And to that end he is authorized to appoint and employ an agent and directed to furnish him with such credentials and instructions as will be likely to accomplish the object of his appointment It requires the agent so appointed to proceed to collect the proper proof to establish the right of such person to his freedom to perform such journeys take such measures institute such legal proceedings c as may be necessary to return such person to this State and charges all expenses incurred in carrying the act into effect upon moneys not otherwise appropriated in the treasury It was necessary to establish two facts to the satisfaction of the Governor First that I was a free citizen of New York and secondly that I was wrongfully held in bondage As to the first point there was no difficulty all the older inhabitants in the vicinity being ready to testify to it The second point rested entirely upon the letter to Parker and Perry written in an unknown hand and upon the letter penned on board the brig Orleans which unfortunately had been mislaid or lost A memorial was prepared directed to his excellency Governor Hunt setting forth her marriage my departure to Washington city the receipt of the letters that I was a free citizen and such other facts as were deemed important and was signed and verified by Anne Accompanying this memorial were several affidavits of prominent citizens of Sandy Hill and Fort Edward corroborating fully the statements it contained and also a request of several well known gentlemen to the Governor that Henry B Northup be appointed agent under the legislative act On reading the memorial and affidavits his excellency took a lively interest in the matter and on the d day of November under the seal of the State constituted appointed and employed Henry B Northup Esq an agent with full power to effect my restoration and to take such measures as would See Appendix A be most likely to accomplish it and instructing him to proceed to Louisiana with all convenient dispatch The pressing nature of Mr Northup's professional and political engagements delayed his departure until December On the fourteenth day of that month he left Sandy Hill and proceeded to Washington The Hon Pierre Soule Senator in Congress from Louisiana Hon Mr Conrad Secretary of War and Judge Nelson of the Supreme Court of the United States upon hearing a statement of the facts and examining his commission and certified copies of the memorial and affidavits furnished him with open letters to gentlemen in Louisiana strongly urging their assistance in accomplishing the object of his appointment Senator Soule especially interested himself in the matter insisting in forcible language that it was the duty and interest of every planter in his State to aid in restoring me to freedom and trusted the sentiments of honor and justice in the bosom of every citizen of the commonwealth would enlist him at once in my behalf Having obtained these valuable letters Mr Northup returned to Baltimore and proceeded from thence to Pittsburgh It was his original intention under advice of friends at Washington to go directly to New Orleans and consult the authorities of that city Providentially however on arriving at the mouth of Red River he changed his mind Had he continued on he would not have met with Bass in See Appendix B which case the search for me would probably have been fruitless Taking passage on the first steamer that arrived he pursued his journey up Red River a sluggish winding stream flowing through a vast region of primitive forests and impenetrable swamps almost wholly destitute of inhabitants About nine o'clock in the forenoon January st he left the steamboat at Marksville and proceeded directly to Marksville Court House a small village four miles in the interior From the fact that the letter to Messrs Parker and Perry was post marked at Marksville it was supposed by him that I was in that place or its immediate vicinity On reaching this town he at once laid his business before the Hon John P Waddill a legal gentleman of distinction and a man of fine genius and most noble impulses After reading the letters and documents presented him and listening to a representation of the circumstances under which I had been carried away into captivity Mr Waddill at once proffered his services and entered into the affair with great zeal and earnestness He in common with others of like elevated character looked upon the kidnapped with abhorrence The title of his fellow parishioners and clients to the property which constituted the larger proportion of their wealth not only depended upon the good faith in which slave sales were transacted but he was a man in whose honorable heart emotions of indignation were aroused by such an instance of injustice Marksville although occupying a prominent position and standing out in impressive italics on the map of Louisiana is in fact but a small and insignificant hamlet Aside from the tavern kept by a jolly and generous boniface the court house inhabited by lawless cows and swine in the seasons of vacation and a high gallows with its dissevered rope dangling in the air there is little to attract the attention of the stranger Solomon Northup was a name Mr Waddill had never heard but he was confident that if there was a slave bearing that appellation in Marksville or vicinity his black boy Tom would know him Tom was accordingly called but in all his extensive circle of acquaintances there was no such personage The letter to Parker and Perry was dated at Bayou Boeuf At this place therefore the conclusion was I must be sought But here a difficulty suggested itself of a very grave character indeed Bayou Boeuf at its nearest point was twenty three miles distant and was the name applied to the section of country extending between fifty and a hundred miles on both sides of that stream Thousands and thousands of slaves resided upon its shores the remarkable richness and fertility of the soil having attracted thither a great number of planters The information in the letter was so vague and indefinite as to render it difficult to conclude upon any specific course of proceeding It was finally determined however as the only plan that presented any prospect of success that Northup and the brother of Waddill a student in the office of the latter should repair to the Bayou and traveling up one side and down the other its whole length inquire at each plantation for me Mr Waddill tendered the use of his carriage and it was definitely arranged that they should start upon the excursion early Monday morning It will be seen at once that this course in all probability would have resulted unsuccessfully It would have been impossible for them to have gone into the fields and examine all the gangs at work They were not aware that I was known only as Platt and had they inquired of Epps himself he would have stated truly that he knew nothing of Solomon Northup The arrangement being adopted however there was nothing further to be done until Sunday had elapsed The conversation between Messrs Northup and Waddill in the course of the afternoon turned upon New York politics I can scarcely comprehend the nice distinctions and shades of political parties in your State observed Mr Waddill I read of soft shells and hard shells hunkers and barnburners woolly heads and silver grays and am unable to understand the precise difference between them Pray what is it Mr Northup re filling his pipe entered into quite an elaborate narrative of the origin of the various reactions of parties and concluded by saying there was another party in New York known as free soilers or abolitionists You have seen none of those in this part of the country I presume Mr Northup remarked Never but one answered Waddill laughingly We have one here in Marksville an eccentric creature who preaches abolitionism as vehemently as any fanatic at the North He is a generous inoffensive man but always maintaining the wrong side of an argument It affords us a deal of amusement He is an excellent mechanic and almost indispensable in this community He is a carpenter His name is Bass Some further good natured conversation was had at the expense of Bass' peculiarities when Waddill all at once fell into a reflective mood and asked for the mysterious letter again Let me see l e t m e s e e he repeated thoughtfully to himself running his eyes over the letter once more 'Bayou Boeuf August ' August post marked here 'He that is writing for me ' Where did Bass work last summer he inquired turning suddenly to his brother His brother was unable to inform him but rising left the office and soon returned with the intelligence that Bass worked last summer somewhere on Bayou Boeuf He is the man 'bringing down his hand emphatically on the table ' who can tell us all about Solomon Northup exclaimed Waddill Bass was immediately searched for but could not be found After some inquiry it was ascertained he was at the landing on Red River Procuring a conveyance young Waddill and Northup were not long in traversing the few miles to the latter place On their arrival Bass was found just on the point of leaving to be absent a fortnight or more After an introduction Northup begged the privilege of speaking to him privately a moment They walked together towards the river when the following conversation ensued Mr Bass said Northup allow me to ask you if you were on Bayou Boeuf last August Yes sir I was there in August was the reply Did you write a letter for a colored man as that place to some gentleman in Saratoga Springs Excuse me sir if I say that is none of your business answered Bass stopping and looking his interrogator searchingly in the face Perhaps I am rather hasty Mr Bass I beg your pardon but I have come from the State of New York to accomplish the purpose the writer of a letter dated the th of August post marked at Marksville had in view Circumstances have led me to think that you are perhaps the man who wrote it I am in search of Solomon Northup If you know him I beg you to inform me frankly where he is and I assure you the source of any information you may give me shall not be divulged if you desire it not to be A long time Bass looked his new acquaintance steadily in the eyes without opening his lips He seemed to be doubting in his own mind if there was not an attempt to practice some deception upon him Finally he said deliberately I have done nothing to be ashamed of I am the man who wrote the letter If you have come to rescue Solomon Northup I am glad to see you When did you last see him and where is he Northup inquired I last saw him Christmas a week ago to day He is the slave of Edwin Epps a planter on Bayou Boeuf near Holmesville He is not known as Solomon Northup he is called Platt The secret was out the mystery was unraveled Through the thick black cloud amid whose dark and dismal shadows I had walked twelve years broke the star that was to light me back to liberty All mistrust and hesitation were soon thrown aside and the two men conversed long and freely upon the subject uppermost in their thoughts Bass expressed the interest he had taken in my behalf his intention of going north in the Spring and declaring that he had resolved to accomplish my emancipation if it were in his power He described the commencement and progress of his acquaintance with me and listened with eager curiosity to the account given him of my family and the history of my early life Before separating he drew a map of the bayou on a strip of paper with a piece of red chalk showing the locality of Epps' plantation and the road leading most directly to it Northup and his young companion returned to Marksville where it was determined to commence legal proceedings to test the question of my right to freedom I was made plaintiff Mr Northup acting as my guardian and Edwin Epps defendant The process to be issued was in the nature of replevin directed to the sheriff of the parish commanding him to take me into custody and detain me until the decision of the court By the time the papers were duly drawn up it was twelve o'clock at night too late to obtain the necessary signature of the Judge who resided some distance out of town Further business was therefore suspended until Monday morning Everything apparently was moving along swimmingly until Sunday afternoon when Waddill called at Northup's room to express his apprehension of difficulties they had not expected to encounter Bass had become alarmed and had placed his affairs in the hands of a person at the landing communicating to him his intention of leaving the State This person had betrayed the confidence reposed in him to a certain extent and a rumor began to float about the town that the stranger at the hotel who had been observed in the company of lawyer Waddill was after one of old Epps slaves over on the bayou Epps was known at Marksville having frequent occasion to visit that place during the session of the courts and the fear entertained by Mr Northup's adviser was that intelligence would be conveyed to him in the night giving him an opportunity of secreting me before the arrival of the sheriff This apprehension had the effect of expediting matters considerably The sheriff who lived in one direction from the village was requested to hold himself in readiness immediately after midnight while the Judge was informed he would be called upon at the same time It is but justice to say that the authorities at Marksville cheerfully rendered all the assistance in their power As soon after midnight as bail could be perfected and the Judge's signature obtained a carriage containing Mr Northup and the sheriff driven by the landlord's son rolled rapidly out of the village of Marksville on the road towards Bayou Boeuf It was supposed that Epps would contest the issue involving my right to liberty and it therefore suggested itself to Mr Northup that the testimony of the sheriff describing my first meeting with the former might perhaps become material on the trial It was accordingly arranged during the ride that before I had an opportunity of speaking to Mr Northup the sheriff should propound to me certain questions agreed upon such as the number and names of my children the name of my wife before marriage of places I knew at the North and so forth If my answers corresponded with the statements given him the evidence must necessarily be considered conclusive At length shortly after Epps had left the field with the consoling assurance that he would soon return and warm us as was stated in the conclusion of the preceding they came in sight of the plantation and discovered us at work Alighting from the carriage and directing the driver to proceed to the great house with instructions not to mention to any one the object of their errand until they met again Northup and the sheriff turned from the highway and came towards us across the cotton field We observed them on looking up at the carriage one several rods in advance of the other It was a singular and unusual thing to see white men approaching us in that manner and especially at that early hour in the morning and Uncle Abram and Patsey made some remarks expressive of their astonishment Walking up to Bob the sheriff inquired Where's the boy they call Platt Thar he is massa answered Bob pointing to me and twitching off his hat I wondered to myself what business he could possibly have with me and turning round gazed at him until he had approached within a step During my long residence on the bayou I had become familiar with the face of every planter within many miles but this man was an utter stranger certainly I had never seen him before Your name is Platt is it he asked Yes master I responded Pointing towards Northup standing a few rods distant he demanded Do you know that man I looked in the direction indicated and as my eyes rested on his countenance a world of images thronged my brain a multitude of well known faces Anne's and the dear children's and my old dead father's all the scenes and associations of childhood and youth all the friends of other and happier days appeared and disappeared flitting and floating like dissolving shadows before the vision of my imagination until at last the perfect memory of the man recurred to me and throwing up my hands towards Heaven I exclaimed in a voice louder than I could utter in a less exciting moment Henry B Northup Thank God thank God In an instant I comprehended the nature of his business and felt that the hour of my deliverance was at hand I started towards him but the sheriff stepped before me Stop a moment said he have you any other name than Platt Solomon Northup is my name master I replied Have you a family he inquired I had a wife and three children What were your children's names Elizabeth Margaret and Alonzo And your wife's name before her marriage Anne Hampton Who married you Timothy Eddy of Fort Edward Where does that gentleman live again pointing to Northup who remained standing in the same place where I had first recognized him He lives in Sandy Hill Washington county New York was the reply He was proceeding to ask further questions but I pushed past him unable longer to restrain myself I seized my old acquaintance by both hands I could not speak I could not refrain from tears Sol he said at length I'm glad to see you I essayed to make some answer but emotion choked all utterance and I was silent The slaves utterly confounded stood gazing upon the scene their open mouths and rolling eyes indicating the utmost wonder and astonishment For ten years I had dwelt among them in the field and in the cabin borne the same hardships partaken the same fare mingled my griefs with theirs participated in the same scanty joys nevertheless not until this hour the last I was to remain among them had the remotest suspicion of my true name or the slightest knowledge of my real history been entertained by any one of them Not a word was spoken for several minutes during which time I clung fast to Northup looking up into his face fearful I should awake and find it all a dream Throw down that sack Northup added finally your cotton picking days are over Come with us to the man you live with I obeyed him and walking between him and the sheriff we moved towards the great house It was not until we had proceeded some distance that I had recovered my voice sufficiently to ask if my family were all living He informed me he had seen Anne Margaret and Elizabeth but a short time previously that Alonzo was also living and all were well My mother however I could never see again As I began to recover in some measure from the sudden and great excitement which so overwhelmed me I grew faint and weak insomuch it was with difficulty I could walk The sheriff took hold of my arm and assisted me or I think I should have fallen As we entered the yard Epps stood by the gate conversing with the driver That young man faithful to his instructions was entirely unable to give him the least information in answer to his repeated inquiries of what was going on By the time we reached him he was almost as much amazed and puzzled as Bob or Uncle Abram Shaking hands with the sheriff and receiving an introduction to Mr Northup he invited them into house ordering me at the same time to bring in some wood It was some time before I succeeded in cutting an armful having somehow unaccountably lost the power of wielding the axe with any manner of precision When I entered with it at last the table was strewn with papers from one of which Northup was reading I was probably longer than necessity required in placing the sticks upon the fire being particular as to the exact position of each individual one of them I heard the words the said Solomon Northup and the deponent further says and free citizen of New York repeated frequently and from these expressions understood that the secret I had so long retained from Master and Mistress Epps was finally developing I lingered as long as prudence permitted and was about leaving the room when Epps inquired Platt do you know this gentleman Yes master I replied I have known him as long as I can remember Where does he live He lives in New York Did you ever live there Yes master born and bred there You was free then Now you d d nigger he exclaimed why did you not tell me that when I bought you Master Epps I answered in a somewhat different tone than the one in which I had been accustomed to address him Master Epps you did not take the trouble to ask me besides I told one of my owners the man that kidnapped me that I was free and was whipped almost to death for it It seems there has been a letter written for you by somebody Now who is it he demanded authoritatively I made no reply I say who wrote that letter he demanded again Perhaps I wrote it myself I said You haven't been to Marksville post office and back before light I know He insisted upon my informing him and I insisted I would not He made many vehement threats against the man whoever he might be and intimated the bloody and savage vengeance he would wreak upon him when he found him out his whole manner and language exhibited a feeling of anger towards the unknown person who had written for me and of fretfulness at the idea of losing so much property Addressing Mr Northup he swore if he had only had an hour's notice of his coming he would have saved him the trouble of taking me back to New York that he would have run me into the swamp or some other place out of the way where all the sheriffs on earth couldn't have found me I walked out into the yard and was entering the kitchen door when something struck me in the back Aunt Phebe emerging from the back door of the great house with a pan of potatoes had thrown one of them with unnecessary violence thereby giving me to understand that she wished to speak to me a moment confidentially Running up to me she whispered in my ear with great earnestness Lor a' mity Platt what d'ye think Dem two men come after ye Heard 'em tell masse you free got wife and tree children back thar whar you come from Goin' wid 'em Fool if ye don't wish I could go and Aunt Phebe ran on in this manner at a rapid rate Presently Mistress Epps made her appearance in the kitchen She said many things to me and wondered why I had not told her who I was She expressed her regret complimenting me by saying she had rather lose any other servant on the plantation Had Patsey that day stood in my place the measure of my mistress' joy would have overflowed Now there was no one left who could mend a chair or a piece of furniture no one who was of any use about the house no one who could play for her on the violin and Mistress Epps was actually affected to tears Epps had called to Bob to bring up his saddle horse The other slaves also overcoming their fear of the penalty had left their work and come to the yard They were standing behind the cabins out of sight of Epps They beckoned me to come to them and with all the eagerness of curiosity excited to the highest pitch conversed with and questioned me If I could repeat the exact words they uttered with the same emphasis if I could paint their several attitudes and the expression of their countenances it would be indeed an interesting picture In their estimation I had suddenly arisen to an immeasurable height had become a being of immense importance The legal papers having been served and arrangements made with Epps to meet them the next day at Marksville Northup and the sheriff entered the carriage to return to the latter place As I was about mounting to the driver's seat the sheriff said I ought to bid Mr and Mrs Epps good bye I ran back to the piazza where they were standing and taking off my hat said Good bye missis Good bye Platt said Mrs Epps kindly Good bye master Ah you d d nigger muttered Epps in a surly malicious tone of voice you needn't feel so cussed tickled you ain't gone yet I'll see about this business at Marksville to morrow I was only a nigger and knew my place but felt as strongly as if I had been a white man that it would have been an inward comfort had I dared to have given him a parting kick On my way back toward the carriage Patsey ran from behind a cabin and threw her arms about my neck Oh Platt she cried tears streaming down her face you're goin' to be free you're goin' way off yonder where we'll neber see ye any more You've saved me a good many whipping Platt I'm glad you're goin' to be free but oh de Lord de Lord what'll become of me I disengaged myself from her and entered the carriage The driver cracked his whip and away we rolled I looked back and saw Patsey with drooping head half reclining on the ground Mrs Epps was on the piazza Uncle Abram and Bob and Wiley and Aunt Phebe stood by the gate gazing after me I waved my hand but the carriage turned a bend of the bayou hiding them from my eyes forever We stopped a moment at Carey's sugar house where a great number of slaves were at work such an establishment being a curiosity to a Northern man Epps dashed by us on horseback at full speed on the way as we learned next day to the Pine Woods to see William Ford who had brought me into the country Tuesday the fourth of January Epps and his counsel the Hon E Taylor Northup Waddill the Judge and sheriff of Avoyelles and myself met in a room in the village of Marksville Mr Northup stated the facts in regard to me and presented his commission and the affidavits accompanying it The sheriff described the scene in the cotton field I was also interrogated at great length Finally Mr Taylor assured his client that he was satisfied and that litigation would not only be expensive but utterly useless In accordance with his advice a paper was drawn up and signed by the proper parties wherein Epps acknowledged he was satisfied of my right to freedom and formally surrendered me to the authorities of New York It was also stipulated that it be entered of record in the recorder's office of Avoyelles Mr Northup and myself immediately hastened to the landing and taking passage on the first steamer that arrived were soon floating down Red River up which with such desponding thoughts I had been borne twelve years before See Appendix

SCENES PROCEED TO GLENS FALLS MEETING WITH ANNE MARGARET AND ELIZABETH SOLOMON NORTHUP STAUNTON INCIDENTS CONCLUSION As the steamer glided on its way towards New Orleans perhaps I was not happy perhaps there was no difficulty in restraining myself from dancing round the deck perhaps I did not feel grateful to the man who had come so many hundred miles for me perhaps I did not light his pipe and wait and watch his word and run at his slightest bidding If I didn't well no matter We tarried at New Orleans two days During that time I pointed out the locality of Freeman's slave pen and the room in which Ford purchased me We happened to meet Theophilus in the street but I did not think it worth while to renew acquaintance with him From respectable citizens we ascertained he had become a low miserable rowdy a broken down disreputable man We also visited the recorder Mr Genois to whom Senator Soule's letter was directed and found him a man well deserving the wide and honorable reputation that he bears He very generously furnished us with a sort of legal pass over his signature and seal of office and as it contains the recorder's description of my personal appearance it may not be amiss to insert it here The following is a copy State of Louisiana City of New Orleans Recorder's Office Second District To all to whom these presents shall come This is to certify that Henry B Northup Esquire of the county of Washington New York has produced before me due evidence of the freedom of Solomon a mulatto man aged about forty two years five feet seven inches and six lines woolly hair and chestnut eyes who is a native born of the State of New York That the said Northup being about bringing the said Solomon to his native place through the southern routes the civil authorities are requested to let the aforesaid colored man Solomon pass unmolested he demeaning well and properly Given under my hand and the seal of the city of New Orleans this th January L S TH GENOIS Recorder On the th we came to Lake Pontchartrain by railroad and in due time following the usual route reached Charleston After going on board the steamboat and paying our passage at this city Mr Northup was called upon by a custom house officer to explain why he had not registered his servant He replied that he had no servant that as the agent of New York he was accompanying a free citizen of that State from slavery to freedom and did not desire nor intend to make any registry whatever I conceived from his conversation and manner though I may perhaps be entirely mistaken that no great pains would be taken to avoid whatever difficulty the Charleston officials might deem proper to create At length however we were permitted to proceed and passing through Richmond where I caught a glimpse of Goodin's pen arrived in Washington January th We ascertained that both Burch and Radburn were still residing in that city Immediately a complaint was entered with a police magistrate of Washington against James H Burch for kidnapping and selling me into slavery He was arrested upon a warrant issued by Justice Goddard and returned before Justice Mansel and held to bail in the sum of three thousand dollars When first arrested Burch was much excited exhibiting the utmost fear and alarm and before reaching the justice's office on Louisiana Avenue and before knowing the precise nature of the complaint begged the police to permit him to consult Benjamin O Shekels a slave trader of seventeen years standing and his former partner The latter became his bail At ten o'clock the th of January both parties appeared before the magistrate Senator Chase of Ohio Hon Orville Clark of Sandy Hill and Mr Northup acted as counsel for the prosecution and Joseph H Bradley for the defence Gen Orville Clark was called and sworn as a witness and testified that he had known me from childhood and that I was a free man as was my father before me Mr Northup then testified to the same and proved the facts connected with his mission to Avoyelles Ebenezer Radburn was then sworn for the prosecution and testified he was forty eight years old that he was a resident of Washington and had known Burch fourteen years that in he was keeper of Williams' slave pen that he remembered the fact of my confinement in the pen that year At this point it was admitted by the defendant's counsel that I had been placed in the pen by Burch in the spring of and hereupon the prosecution rested Benjamin O Shekels was then offered as a witness by the prisoner Benjamin is a large coarse featured man and the reader may perhaps get a somewhat correct conception of him by reading the exact language he used in answer to the first question of defendant's lawyer He was asked the place of his nativity and his reply uttered in a sort of rowdyish way was in these very words I was born in Ontario county New York and weighed fourteen pounds Benjamin was a prodigious baby He further testified that he kept the Steamboat Hotel in Washington in and saw me there in the spring of that year He was proceeding to state what he had heard two men say when Senator Chase raised a legal objection to wit that the sayings of third persons being hearsay was improper evidence The objection was overruled by the Justice and Shekels continued stating that two men came to his hotel and represented they had a colored man for sale that they had an interview with Burch that they stated they came from Georgia but he did not remember the county that they gave a full history of the boy saying he was a bricklayer and played on the violin that Burch remarked he would purchase if they could agree that they went out and brought the boy in and that I was the same person He further testified with as much unconcern as if it was the truth that I represented I was born and bred in Georgia that one of the young men with me was my master that I exhibited a great deal of regret at parting with him and he believed got into tears nevertheless that I insisted my master had a right to sell me that he ought to sell me and the remarkable reason I gave was according to Shekels because he my master had been gambling and on a spree He continued in these words copied from the minutes taken on the examination Burch interrogated the boy in the usual manner told him if he purchased him he should send him south The boy said he had no objection that in fact he would like to go south Burch paid for him to my knowledge I don't know what name was given him but think it was not Solomon Did not know the name of either of the two men They were in my tavern two or three hours during which time the boy played on the violin The bill of sale was signed in my bar room It was a printed blank filled up by Burch Before Burch was my partner Our business was buying and selling slaves After that time he was a partner of Theophilus Freeman of New Orleans Burch bought here Freeman sold there Shekels before testifying had heard my relation of the circumstances connected with the visit to Washington with Brown and Hamilton and therefore it was undoubtedly he spoke of two men and of my playing on the violin Such was his fabrication utterly untrue and yet there was found in Washington a man who endeavored to corroborate him Benjamin A Thorn testified he was at Shekels' in and saw a colored boy playing on a fiddle Shekels said he was for sale Heard his master tell him he should sell him The boy acknowledged to me he was a slave I was not present when the money was paid Will not swear positively this is the boy The master came near shedding tears I think the boy did I have been engaged in the business of taking slaves south off and on for twenty years When I can't do that I do something else I was then offered as a witness but objection being made the court decided my evidence inadmissible It was rejected solely on the ground that I was a colored man the fact of my being a free citizen of New York not being disputed Shekels having testified there was a bill of sale executed Burch was called upon by the prosecution to produce it inasmuch as such a paper would corroborate the testimony of Thorn and Shekels The prisoner's counsel saw the necessity of exhibiting it or giving some reasonable explanation for its non production To effect the latter Burch himself was offer as a witness in his own behalf It was contended by counsel for the people that such testimony should not be allowed that it was in contravention of every rule of evidence and if permitted would defeat the ends of justice His testimony however was received by the court He made oath that such a bill of sale had been drawn up and signed but he had lost it and did not know what had become of it Thereupon the magistrate was requested to dispatch a police officer to Burch's residence with directions to bring his books containing his bills of sales for the year The request was granted and before any measure could be taken to prevent it the officer had obtained possession of the books and brought them into court The sales for the year were found and carefully examined but no sale of myself by any name was discovered Upon this testimony the court held the fact to be established that Burch came innocently and honestly by me and accordingly he was discharged An attempt was then made by Burch and his satellites to fasten upon me the charge that I had conspired with the two white men to defraud him with what success appears in an extract taken from an article in the New York Times published a day or two subsequent to the trial The counsel for the defendant had drawn up before the defendant was discharged an affidavit signed by Burch and had a warrant out against the colored man for a conspiracy with the two white men before referred to to defraud Burch out of six hundred and twenty five dollars The warrant was served and the colored man arrested and brought before officer Goddard Burch and his witnesses appeared in court and H B Northup appeared as counsel for the colored man stating he was ready to proceed as counsel on the part of the defendant and asking no delay whatever Burch after consulting privately a short time with Shekels stated to the magistrate that he wished him to dismiss the complaint as he would not proceed farther with it Defendant's counsel stated to the magistrate that if the complaint was withdrawn it must be without the request or consent of the defendant Burch then asked the magistrate to let him have the complaint and the warrant and he took them The counsel for the defendant objected to his receiving them and insisted they should remain as part of the records of the court and that the court should endorse the proceedings which had been had under the process Burch delivered them up and the court rendered a judgement of discontinuance by the request of the prosecutor and filed it in his office There may be those who will affect to believe the statement of the slave trader those in whose minds his allegations will weigh heavier than mine I am a poor colored man one of a down trodden and degraded race whose humble voice may not be heeded by the oppressor but knowing the truth and with a full sense of my accountability I do solemnly declare before men and before God that any charge or assertion that I conspired directly or indirectly with any person or persons to sell myself that any other account of my visit to Washington my capture and imprisonment in Williams slave pen shall is contained in these s is utterly and absolutely false I never played on the violin in Washington I never was in the Steamboat Hotel and never saw Thorn or Shekels to my knowledge in my life until last January The story of the trio of slave traders is a fabrication as absurd as it is base and unfounded Were it true I should not have turned aside on my way back to liberty for the purpose of prosecuting Burch I should have avoided rather than sought him I should have known that such a step would have resulted in rendering me infamous Under the circumstances longing as I did to behold my family and elated with the prospect of returning home it is an outrage upon probability to suppose I would have run the hazard not only of exposure but of a criminal prosecution and conviction by voluntarily placing myself in the position I did if the statements of Burch and his confederates contain a particle of truth I took pains to seek him out to confront him in a court of law charging him with the crime of kidnapping and the only motive that impelled me to this step was a burning sense of the wrong he had inflicted upon me and a desire to bring him to justice He was acquitted in the manner and by such means as have been described A human tribunal has permitted him to escape but there is another and a higher tribunal where false testimony will not prevail and where I am willing so far at least as these statements are concerned to be judged at last We left Washington on the th of January and proceeding by the way of Philadelphia New York and Albany reached Sandy Hill in the night of the st My heart overflowed with happiness as I looked around upon old familiar scenes and found myself in the midst of friends of other days The following morning I started in company with several acquaintances for Glens Falls the residence of Anne and our children As I entered their comfortable cottage Margaret was the first that met me She did not recognize me When I left her she was but seven years old a little prattling girl playing with her toys Now she was grown to womanhood was married with a bright eyed boy standing by her side Not forgetful of his enslaved unfortunate grand father she had named the child Solomon Northup Staunton When told who I was she was overcome with emotion and unable to speak Presently Elizabeth entered the room and Anne came running from the hotel having been informed of my arrival They embraced me and with tears flowing down their cheeks hung upon my neck But I draw a veil over a scene which can better be imagined than described When the violence of our emotions had subsided to a sacred joy when the household gathered round the fire that sent out its warm and crackling comfort through the room we conversed of the thousand events that had occurred the hopes and fears the joys and sorrows the trials and troubles we had each experienced during the long separation Alonzo was absent in the western part of the State The boy had written to his mother a short time previous of the prospect of his obtaining sufficient money to purchase my freedom From his earliest years that had been the chief object of his thoughts and his ambition They knew I was in bondage The letter written on board the brig and Clem Ray himself had given them that information But where I was until the arrival of Bass' letter was a matter of conjecture Elizabeth and Margaret once returned from school so Anne informed me weeping bitterly On inquiring the cause of the children's sorrow it was found that while studying geography their attention had been attracted to the picture of slaves working in the cotton field and an overseer following them with his whip It reminded them of the sufferings father might be and as it happened actually was enduring in the South Numerous incidents such as these were related incidents showing they still held me in constant remembrance but not perhaps of sufficient interest to the reader to be recounted My narrative is at an end I have no comments to make upon the subject of Slavery Those who read this book may form their own opinions of the peculiar institution What it may be in other States I do not profess to know what it is in the region of Red River is truly and faithfully delineated in these s This is no fiction no exaggeration If I have failed in anything it has been in presenting to the reader too prominently the bright side of the picture I doubt not hundreds have been as unfortunate as myself that hundreds of free citizens have been kidnapped and sold into slavery and are at this moment wearing out their lives on plantations in Texas and Louisiana But I forbear Chastened and subdued in spirit by the sufferings I have borne and thankful to that good Being through whose mercy I have been restored to happiness and liberty I hope henceforward to lead an upright though lowly life and rest at last in the church yard where my father sleeps ROARING RIVER A REFRAIN OF THE RED RIVER PLANTATION Harper's creek and roarin' ribber Thar

Henry-Bibb,NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF HENRY BIBB AN AMERICAN SLAVE WRITTEN BY HIMSELF WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY LUCIUS C MATLACK NEW YORK PUBLISHED BY THE AUTHOR SPRUCE STREET verso Entered according to the Act of Congress in the year By HENRY BIBB In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the Southern District of New York MACDONALD LEE PRINTERS SPRUCE STREET N Y i INTRODUCTION FROM the most obnoxious substances we often see spring forth beautiful and fragrant flowers of every hue to regale the eye and perfume the air Thus frequently are results originated which are wholly unlike the cause that gave them birth An illustration of this truth is afforded by the history of American Slavery Naturally and necessarily the enemy of literature it has come the prolific theme of much that is profound in argument sublime in poetry and thrilling in narrative From the soil of slavery itself have sprang forth some of the most brilliant productions whose logical levers will ultimately upheave and overthrow the system Gushing fountains of poetic thought have started from beneath the rod of violence that will long continue to slake the feverish thirst of humanity outraged until swelling to a flood it shall rush with wasting violence over the ill gotten heritage of the oppressor Startling incidents authenticated far excelling fiction in their touching pathos from the pen of self emancipated slaves do now exhibit slavery in such revolting aspects as to secure the execrations of all good men and become a monument more enduring than marble in testimony strong as sacred writ against it Of the class last named is the narrative of the life of Henry Bibb which is equally distinguished as a revolting portrait of the hideous slave system a thrilling narrative of individual suffering and a triumphant vindication of the slave's manhood and mental dignity And all this is associated with unmistakable traces of originality and truthfulness To many the elevated style purity of diction and easy flow of language frequently exhibited will appear unaccountable and contradictory in view of his want of early mental culture ii But to the thousands who have listened with delight to his speeches on anniversary and other occasions these same traits will be noted as unequivocal evidence of originality Very few men present in their written composition so perfect a transcript of their style as is exhibited by Mr Bibb Moreover the writer of this introduction is well acquainted with his handwriting and style The entire manuscript I have examined and prepared for the press Many of the closing s of it were written by Mr Bibb in my office And the whole is preserved for inspection now An examination of it will show that no alteration of sentiment language or style was necessary to make it what it now is in the hands of the reader The work of preparation for the press was that of orthography and punctuation merely an arrangement of the s and a table of contents little more than falls to the lot of publishers generally The fidelity of the narrative is sustained by the most satisfactory and ample testimony Time has proved its claims to truth Thorough investigation has sifted and analysed every essential fact alleged and demonstrated clearly that this thrilling and eloquent narrative though stranger than fiction is undoubtedly true It is only necessary to present the following documents to the reader to sustain this declaration For convenience of reference and that they may be more easily understood the letters will be inserted consecutively with explanations following the last The best preface to these letters is the report of a committee appointed to investigate the truth of Mr Bibb's narrative as he has delivered it in public for years past REPORT OF THE UNDERSIGNED COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE DETROIT LIBERTY ASSOCIATION TO INVESTIGATE THE TRUTH OF THE NARRATIVE OF HENRY BIBB A FUGITIVE FROM SLAVERY AND REPORT THEREON Mr Bibb has addressed several assemblies in Michigan and his narrative is generally known Some of his hearers among whom were Liberty men felt doubt as to the truth of his statements Respect for their scruples and the obligation of duty iii to the public induced the formation of the present Committee The Committee entered on the duty confided to them resolved on a searching scrutiny and all unreserved publication of its result Mr Bibb acquiesced in the inquiry with a praiseworthy spirit He attended before the Committee and gave willing aid to its object He was subjected to a rigorous examination Facts dates persons and localities were demanded and cheerfully furnished Proper inquiry either by letter or personally or through the medium of friends was then made from every person and in every quarter likely to elucidate the truth In fact no test for its ascertainment known to the sense or experience of the Committee was omitted The result was the collection of a large body of testimony from very diversified quarters Slave owners slave dealers fugitives from slavery political friends and political foes contributed to a mass of testimony every part of which pointed to a common conclusions the undoubted truth of Mr Bibb's statements In the Committee's opinion no individual can substantiate the events of his life by testimony more conclusive and harmonious than is now before them in confirmation of Mr Bibb The main facts of his narrative and many of the minor ones are corroborated beyond all question No inconsistency has been disclosed nor anything revealed to create suspicion The Committee have no hesitation in declaring their conviction that Mr Bibb is amply sustained and is entitled to public confidence and high esteem The bulk of testimony precludes its publication but it is in the Committee's hands for the inspection of any applicant A L PORTER C H STEWART SILAS M HOLMES Committee DETROIT April From the bulk of testimony obtained a part only is here introduced The remainder fully corroborates and strengthens that No An Extract DAWN MILLS FEB th CHARLES H STEWART ESQ MY DEAR BROTHER Your kind communication of the th came to hand yesterday I have made inquiries respecting Henry Bibb which may be of service to you Mr Wm Harrison to whom you allude in your letter is here He is a respectable and worthy man a man of piety I have just had in interview with him this evening He testifies that he was well acquainted with Henry Bibb in Trimble County Ky and that he sent a letter to him by Thomas Henson and got one in return from him He says that Bibb came out to Canada some three years ago and went back to get his wife up but was betrayed at Cincinnati by a colored man that he was taken to Louisville but got away iv was taken again and lodged in jail and sold off to New Orleans or he Harrison understood that he was taken to New Orleans He testifies that Bibb is a Methodist man and says that two persons who came on with him last Summer knew Bibb One of these Simpson Young is now at Malden Very respectfully thy friend HIRAM WILSON No BEDFORD TRIMBLE CO KENTUCKY March SIR Your letter under date of the th ult is now before me making some inquiry about a person supposed to be a fugitive from the South who is lecturing to your religious community on Slavery and the South I am pleased to inform you that I have it in my power to give you the information you desire The person spoken of by you I have no doubt is Walton yellow man who once belonged to my father William Gatewood He was purchased by him from John Sibly and by John Sibly of his brother Albert G Sibly and Albert G Sibly became possessed of him by his marriage with Judge David White's daughter he being born Judge White's slave The boy Walton at the time he belonged to John Sibly married a slave of my father's a mulatto girl and sometime afterwards solicited him to buy him the old man after much importuning from Walton consented to do so and accordingly paid Sibly eight hundred and fifty dollars He did not buy him because he needed him but from the fact that he had a wife there and Walton on his part promising every thing that my father could desire It was not long however before Walton became indolent and neglectful of his duty and in addition to this he was guilty as the old man thought of worse offences He watched his conduct more strictly and found he was guilty of disposing of articles from the farm and pocketing the money He actually caught him one day stealing wheat he had conveyed one sack full to a neighbor and whilst he was delivering the other my father caught him in the very act He confessed his guilt and promised to do better for the future and on his making promises of this kind my father was disposed to keep him still not wishing to part him from his wife for whom he professed to entertain the strongest of affection When the Christmas holidays came on the old man as usual in this country gave his negroes a week Holiday Walton instead of regaling himself by going about visiting colored friends took up his line of march for her Britanic Majesty's dominions He was gone about two years I think when I heard of him v in Cincinnati I repaired thither with some few friends to aid me and succeeded in securing him He was taken to Louisville and on the next morning after our arrival there he escaped almost from before our face while we were on the street before the Tavern He succeeded in eluding our pursuit and again reached Canada in safety Nothing daunted he returned after a lapse of some twelve or eighteen months with the intention as I have since learned of conducting off his wife and eight or ten more slaves to Canada I got news of his whereabouts and succeeded in recapturing him I took him to Louisville and together with his wife and child she going along with him at her owner's request sold hem He was taken from thence to New Orleans and from hence to Red River Arkansas and the next news I had of him he was again wending his way to Canada and I suppose now is at or near Detroit In relation to his character it was the general opinion here that he was a notorious liar and a rogue These things I can procure any number of respectable witnesses to prove In proof of it he says his mother belonged to James Bibb which is a lie there not having been such a man about here much less brother of Secretary Bibb He says that Bibb's daughter married A G Sibly when the fact is Sibly married Judge David White's daughter and his mother belonged to White also an is now here free So you will perceive he is guilty of lying for no effect and what might it not be supposed he would do where he could effect anything by it I have been more tedious than I should have been but being anxious to give you his rascally conduct in full must be my apology You are at liberty to publish this letter or make any use you see proper of it If you do publish it let me have a paper containing the publication at any rate let me hear from you again Respectfully yours c SILAS GATEWOOD To C H STEWART Esq No An Extract CINCINNATI March MY DEAR SIR Mrs Path Nickens and Woodson did not see Bibb on his first visit in when he staid with Job Dundy but were subsequently told of it by Bibb They first saw him in May Mrs Path remembers this date because it was the month in which she removed from Broadway to Harrison street and Bibb assisted her to remove Mrs Path's garden adjoined Dundy's back yard While engaged in digging up flowers she was addressed by Bibb who was staying with Dundy and who offered to dig them up for her She hired vi him to do it Mrs Dundy shortly after called over and told Mrs Path that he was a slave After that Mrs Path took him into her house and concealed him While concealed he astonished his good protectress by his ingenuity in bottoming chairs with cane When the furniture was removed Bibb insisted on helping and was after some remonstrances permitted At the house on Harrison Street he was employed for several days in digging a cellar and was so employed when seized on Saturday afternoon by the constables He held frequent conversations with Mrs Path and others in which he gave them the same account which he has given you On Saturday afternoon two noted slave catching constables E V Brooks and O'Neill surprised Bibb as he was digging in the cellar Bibb sprang for the fence and gained the top of it where he was seized and dragged back They took him immediately before William Doty a Justice of infamous notoriety as an accomplice of kidnappers proved property paid charges and took him away His distressed friends were surprised by his re appearance in a few days after the Wednesday following as they think He reached the house of Dr Woods a colored since Deceased before day break and staid until dusk Mrs Path John Woodson and others made up about twelve dollars for him Woodson accompanied him out of town a mile and bid him God Speed He has never been here since Woodson and Clark saw him at Detroit two years ago Yours truly WILLIAM BIRNEY No LOUISVILLE March MR STEWART Yours of the st came to hand on the th inst You wished me to inform you what became of a boy that was in the work house in the fall of ' The boy you allude to went by the name of Walton he had ran away from Kentucky some time before and returned for his wife was caught and sold to Garrison he was taken to Louisiana I think he was sold on Red River to a planter As Garrison is absent in the City of New Orleans at this time I cannot inform you who he was sold to Garrison will be in Louisville some time this Spring if you wish me I will inquire of Garrison and inform you to whom he was sold and where his master lives at this time Yours W PORTER No BEDFORD TRIMBLE COUNTY KY C H STEWART Esq SIR I received your note on the th inst and in accordance with it I write you these lines You stated that you would vii wish to know something about Walton H Bibb and whether he had a wife and child and whether they were sold to New Orleans Sir before I answer these inquiries I should like to know who Charles H Stewart is and why you should make these inquiries of me and how you knew who I was as you are a stranger to me and I must be to you In your next if you will tell me the intention of your inquiries I will give you a full history of the whole case I have a boy in your county by the name of King a large man and very black if you are acquainted with him give him my compliments an tell him I am well and all of his friends W H Bibb is acquainted with him I wait your answer Your most obedient W H GATEWOOD March No BEDFORD KENTUCKY April th MR CHARLES H STEWART SIR Yours of the st March is before me inquiring if one Walton Bibb a colored man escaped from me at Louisville Ky in the Spring of To that inquiry I answer he did The particulars are these He ran off from William Gatewood some time in I think and was heard of in Cincinnati Myself and some others went there and took him and took him to Louisville for sale by the directions of his master While there he made his escape and was gone some time I think about one year or longer He came back it was said to get his wife and child so report says He was again taken by his owner he together with his wife and child was taken to Louisville and sold to a man who traded in negroes and was taken by him to New Orleans and sold with his wife and child to some man up Red River so I was informed by the man who sold him He then ran off and left his wife and child and got back it seems to your Country I can say for Gatewood he was a good master and treated him well Gatewood bought him from a Mr Sibly who was going to send him down the river Walton to my knowledge influenced Gatewood to buy him and promised if he would never to disobey him or run off Who he belongs to now I do not know I know Gatewood sold his wife and child at a great sacrifice to satisfy him If any other information is necessary I will give it if required You will please write me again what he is trying to do in your country or what he wishes the inquiry from me for Yours truly DANIEL S LANE These letters need little comment Their testimony combined is most harmonious and conclusive Look at the points established viii Hiram Wilson gives the testimony of reputable men now in Canada who knew Henry Bibb as a slave in Kentucky Silas Gatewood with a peculiar relish fills three s of foolscap being anxious to give his rascally conduct in full as he says But he vaults over the saddle and lands on the other side His testimony is invaluable as an endorsement of Mr Bibb's truthfulness He illustrates all the essential facts of this narrative He also labors to prove him deceitful and a liar Deceit in a slave is only a slight reflex of the stupendous fraud practised by his master And its indulgence has far more logic in its favor than the ablest plea ever written for slave holding under ever such peculiar circumstances The attempt to prove Mr Bibb in the lie is a signal failure as he never affirmed what Gatewood denies With this offset the letter under notice is a triumphant vindication of one whom he thought thereby to injure sadly As Mr Bibb has most happily acknowledged the wheat see I pass the charge of stealing by referring to the logic there need which will be convincing William Birney Esq attests the facts of Mr Bibb's arrest in Cincinnati and the subsequent escape as narrated by him from the declaration of eye witnesses W Porter Jailor states that Bibb was in the work house at Louisville held and sold afterwards to the persons and at the places named in this volume W H Gatewood with much Southern dignity will answer no questions but show his relation to these matters by naming King saying W H Bibb is acquainted with him and promising a full history of the case Daniel S Lane with remarkable straight forwardness and stupidity tells all he knows and then wants to know what they ask him for The writer will answer that question He wanted to prove by two or more witnesses the truth of his own statements which has most surely been accomplished Having thus presented an array of testimony sustaining the alleged in this narrative the introduction will be concluded by introducing a letter signed by respectable men of ix Detroit and endorsed by Judge Wilkins showing the high esteem in which Mr Bibb is held by those who know him well where he makes his home Their testimony expresses their present regard as well as an opinion of his past character It is introduced here with the greatest satisfaction as the writer is assured from an intimate acquaintance with Henry Bibb that all who know him hereafter will entertain the same sentiment toward him DETROIT March The undersigned have pleasure in recommending Henry Bibb to the kindness and confidence of Anti slavery friends in every State He has resided among us for some years His deportment his conduct and his christian course have won our esteem and affection The narrative of his sufferings and more early life has been thoroughly investigated by a Committee appointed for the purpose They sought evidence respecting it in every proper quarter and their report attested its undoubted truth In this conclusion we all cordially unite H Bibb has for some years publicly made this narrative to assemblies whose number cannot be told it has commanded public attention in this State and provoked inquiry Occasionally too we see persons from the South who knew him in early years yet not a word or fact worthy of impairing its truth has reached us but on the contrary every thing tended to its corroboration Mr Bibb's Anti slavery efforts in this State have produced incalculable benefit The Lord has blessed him into an instrument of great power He has labored much and for very inadequate compensation Lucrative offers for other quarters did not tempt him to a more profitable field His sincerity and disinterestedness are therefore beyond suspicion We bid him God speed on his route We bespeak for him every kind consideration H HALLOCK President of the Detroit Lib Association CULLEN BROWN Vice President S M HOLMES Secretary J D BALDWIN CHARLES H STEWART MARTIN WILSON WILLIAM BARNUM DETROIT Nov The undersigned cheerfully concurs with Mr Hallock and others in their friendly recommendation of Mr Henry Bibb x The undersigned has known him for many months in the Sabbath School in this City partly under his charge and can Certify to his correct deportment and commend him to the Sympathies of Christian benevolence ROSS WILSON The task now performed in preparing for the press and introducing to the public the narrative of Henry Bibb has been one of the most pleasant ever required at my hands And I conclude it with an expression of the hope that it may afford interest to the reader support to the author in his efforts against slavery and be instrumental advancing the great work of emancipation in this country LUCIUS C MATLACK New York City July st xi AUTHOR'S PREFACE This work has been written during irregular intervals while I have been travelling and laboring for the emancipation of my enslaved countrymen The reader will remember that I make no pretension to literature for I can truly say that I have been educated in the school of adversity whips and chains Experience and observation have been my principal teachers with the exception of three weeks schooling which I have had the good fortune to receive since my escape from the grave yard of the mind or the dark prison of human bondage And nothing but untiring perseverance has enabled me to prepare this volume for the public eye and I trust by the aid of Divine Providence to be able to make it intelligible and instructive I thank God for the blessings of Liberty the contrast is truly great between freedom and slavery To be changed from a chattel to a human being is no light matter though the process with myself practically was very simple And if I could reach the ears of every slave to day throughout the whole continent of America I would teach the same lesson I would sound it in the ears of every hereditary bondman break your chains and fly for freedom It may be asked why I have written this work when there has been so much already written and published of the same character from other fugitives And why publish it after having told it publicly all through New England and the Western States to multiplied thousands My answer is that in no place have I given orally the detail of my narrative and some of the most interesting events of my life have never reached the public ear Moreover it was xii at the request of many friends of lowtrodden humanity that I have undertaken to write the following sketch that light and truth might be spread on the sin and evils of slavery as far as possible I also wanted to leave my humble testimony on record against this man destroying system to be read by succeeding generations when my body shall lie mouldering in the dust But I would not attempt by any sophistry to misrepresent slavery in order to prove its dreadful wickedness For I presume there are none who may read this narrative through whether Christians or slaveholders males or females but what will admit it to be a system of the most high handed oppression and tyranny that ever was tolerated by an enlightened nation HENRY BIBB xiii INDEX INTRODUCTION AUTHOR'S PREFACE CHAP I Sketch of my Parentage Early separation from my Mother Hard Fare First Experiments at

THE PRESS NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF HENRY BIBB I Sketch of my Parentage Early separation from my Mother Hard Fare First Experiments at running away Earnest longing for Freedom Abhorrent nature of Slavery I was born May of a slave mother in Shelby County Kentucky and was claimed as the property of David White Esq He came into possession of my mother long before I was born I was brought up in the Counties of Shelby Henry Oldham and Trimble Or more correctly speaking in the above counties I may safely say I was flogged up for where I should have received moral mental and religious instruction I received stripes without number the object of which was to degrade and keep me in subordination I can truly say that I drank deeply of the bitter cup of suffering and woe I have been dragged down to the lowest depths of human degradation and wretchedness by Slaveholders My mother was known by the name of Milldred Jackson She is the mother of seven slaves only all being sons of whom I am the eldest She was also so fortunate or unfortunate as to have some of what is called the slaveholding blood flowing in her veins I know not how much but not enough to prevent her children though fathered by slaveholders from being bought and sold in the slave markets of the South It is almost impossible for slaves to give a correct account of their male parentage All that I know about it is that my mother informed me that my fathers name was James Bibb He was doubtless one of the present Bibb family of Kentucky but I have no personal knowledge of him at all for he died before my recollection The first time I was separated from my mother I was young and small I knew nothing of my condition then as a slave I was living with Mr White whose wife died and left him a widower with one little girl who was said to be the legitimate owner of my mother and all her children This girl was also my playmate when we were children I was taken away from my mother and hired out to labor for various persons eight or ten years in succession and all my wages were expended for the education of Harriet White my playmate It was then my sorrows and sufferings commenced It was then I first commenced seeing and feeling that I was a wretched slave compelled to work under the lash without wages and often without clothes enough to hide my nakedness I have often worked without half enough to eat both late and early by day and by night I have often laid my wearied limbs down at night to rest upon a dirt floor or a bench without any covering at all be cause I had no where else to rest my wearied body after having worked hard all the day I have also been compelled in early life to go at the bidding of a tyrant through all kinds of weather hot or cold wet or dry and without shoes frequently until the month of December with my bare feet on the cold frosty ground cracked open and bleeding as I walked Reader believe me when I say that no tongue nor pen ever has or can express the horrors of American Slavery Consequently I despair in finding language to express adequately the deep feeling of my soul as I contemplate the past history of my life But although I have suffered much from the lash and for want of food and raiment I confess that it was no disadvantage to be passed through the hands of so many families as the only source of information that I had to enlighten my mind consisted in what I could see and hear from others Slaves were not allowed books pen ink nor paper to improve their minds But it seems to me now that I was particularly observing and apt to retain what came under my observation But more especially all that I heard about liberty and freedom to the slaves I never forgot Among other good trades I learned the art of running away to perfection I made a regular business of it and never gave it up until I had broken the bands of slavery and landed myself safely in Canada where I was regarded as a man and not as a thing The first time in my life that I ran away was for ill treatment in I was living with a Mr Vires in the village of Newcastle His wife was a very cross woman She was every day flogging me boxing pulling my ears and scolding so that I dreaded to enter the room where she was This first started me to running away from them I was often gone several days before I was caught They abuse me for going off but it did no good The next time they flogged me I was off again but after awhile they got sick of their bargain and returned me back into the hands of my owners By this time Mr White had married his second wife She was what I call a tyrant I lived with her several months but she kept me almost half of my time in the woods running from under the bloody lash While I was at home she kept me all the time rubbing furniture washing scrubbing the floors and when I was not doing this she would often seat herself in a large rocking chair with two pillows about her and would make me rock her and keep off the flies She was too lazy to scratch her own head and would often make me scratch and comb it for her She would at other times lie on her bed in warm weather and make me fan her while she slept scratch and rub her feet but after awhile she got sick of me and preferred a maiden servant to do such business I was then hired out again but by this time I had become much better skilled in running away and would make calculation to avoid detection by taking with me a bridle If any body should see me in the woods as they have and asked what are you doing here sir you are a runaway I said no sir I am looking for our old mare at other times looking for our cows For such excuses I was let pass In fact the only weapon of self defence that I could use successfully was that of deception It is useless for a poor helpless slave to resist a white man in a slaveholding State Public opinion and the law is against him and resistance in many cases is death to the slave while the law declares that he shall submit or die The circumstances in which I was then placed gave me a longing desire to be free It kindled a fire of liberty within my breast which has never yet been quenched This seemed to be a part of my nature it was first revealed to me by the inevitable laws of nature's God I could see that the All wise Creator had made man a free moral intelligent and accountable being capable of knowing good and evil And I believed then as I believe now that every man has a right to wages for his labor a right to his own wife and children a right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness and a right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience But here in the light of these truths I was a slave a prisoner for life I could possess nothing nor acquire anything but what must belong to my keeper No one can imagine my feelings in my reflecting moments but he who has himself been a slave Oh I have often wept over my condition while sauntering through the forest to escape cruel punishment No arm to protect me from tyrants aggression No parents to cheer me when laden with grief Man may picture the bands of the rocks and the rivers The hills and the valleys the lakes and the ocean But the horrors of slavery he never can trace The term slave to this day sounds with terror to my soul a word too obnoxious to speak a system too intolerable to be endured I know this from long and sad experience I now feel as if I had just been aroused from sleep and looking back with quickened perception at the state of torment from whence I fled I was there held and claimed as a slave as such I was subjected to the will and power of my keeper in all respects whatsoever That the slave is a human being no one can deny It is his lot to be exposed in common with other men to the calamities of sickness death and the misfortunes incident to life But unlike other men he is denied the consolation of struggling against external difficulties such as destroy the life liberty and happiness of himself and family A slave may be bought and sold in the market like an ox He is be sold off to a distant land from his family He is bound in chains hand and foot and his sufferings are aggravated a hundred fold by the terrible thought that he is not allowed to struggle against misfortune corporeal punishment insults and outrages committed upon himself and family and he is not allowed to help himself to resist or escape the blow which he sees impending over him This idea of utter helplessness in perpetual bondage is the more distressing as there is no period even with the remotest generation when it shall terminate Illustration Illustration II A fruitless effort for education The Sabbath among Slaves Degrading amusements Why religion is rejected Condition of poor white people Superstition among slaves Education forbidden IN I had some very serious religious impressions and there was quite a number of slaves in that neighborhood who felt very desirous to be taught to read the Bible There was a Miss Davis a poor white girl who offered to teach a Sabbath School for the slaves notwithstanding public opinion and the law was opposed to it Books were furnished and she commenced the school but the news soon got to our owners that she was teaching us to read This caused quite an excitement in the neighborhood Patrols Police peculiar to the South were appointed to go and break it up the next Sabbath They were determined that we should not have a Sabbath School in operation For slaves this was called an incendiary Movement The Sabbath is not regarded by a large number of the slaves as a day of rest They have no schools to go to no moral nor religious instruction at all in many localities where there are hundreds of Illustration The Sabbath among Slaves slaves Hence they resort to some kind of amusement Those who make no profession of religion resort to the woods in large numbers on that day to gamble fight get drunk and break the Sabbath This is often encouraged by slaveholders When they wish to have a little sport of that kind they go among the slaves and give them whiskey to see them dance pat juber sing and play on the banjo Then get them to wrestling fighting jumping running foot races and butting each other like sheep This is urged on by giving them whiskey making bets on them laying chips on one slave's head and daring another to tip it off with his hand and if he tipped it off it be called an insult and cause a fight Before fighting the parties choose their seconds to stand by them while fighting a ring or a circle is formed to fight in and no one is allowed to enter the ring while they are fighting but their seconds and the white gentlemen They are not allowed to fight a duel nor to use weapons any kind The blows are made by kicking knocking and butting with their heads they grab each other by their ears and jam their heads together like sheep If they are likely to hurt each other very bad their masters would rap them with their walking canes and make them stop After fighting they make friends shake hands and take a dram together and there is no more of it But this is all principally for want of moral instruction This is where they have no Sabbath Schools no one to read the Bible to them no one to preach the gospel who is competent to expound the Scriptures except slaveholders And the slaves with but few exceptions have no confidence at all in their preaching because they preach a pro slavery doctrine They say Servants be obedient to your masters and he that knoweth his masters will and doeth it not shall be beaten with many stripes means that God will send them to hell if they disobey their masters This kind of preaching has driven thousands into infidelity They view themselves as suffering unjustly under the lash without friends without protection of law or gospel and the green eyed monster tyranny staring them in the face They know that they are destined to die in that wretched condition unless they are delivered by the arm of omnipotence And they cannot believe or trust in such a religion as above named The poor and loafering class of whites are about on a par in point of morals with the slaves at the South They are generally ignorant intemperate licentious and profane They associate much with the slaves are often found gambling together on the Sabbath encouraging slaves to steal from their owners and sell to them corn wheat sheep chickens or any thing of the kind which they can well conceal For such offences there is no law to reach a slave but lynch law But if both parties are caught in the act by a white person the slave is punished with the lash while the white man is often punished with both lynch and common law But there is another class of poor white people in the South who I think would be glad to see slavery abolished in self defence they despise the institution because it is impoverishing and degrading to them and their children The slave holders are generally rich aristocratic overbearing and they look with utter contempt upon a poor laboring man who earns his bread by the sweat of his brow whether he be moral or immoral honest or dishonest No matter whether he is white or black if he performs manual labor for a livelihood he is looked upon as being inferior to a slaveholder and but little better off than the slave who toils without wages under the lash It is true that the slaveholder and non slaveholder are living under the same laws in the same State But the one is rich the other is poor one is educated the other is uneducated one has houses land and influence the other has none This being the case that class of the non slaveholders would be glad to see slavery abolished but they dare not speak it aloud There is much superstition among the slaves Many of them believe in what they call conjuration tricking and witchcraft and some of them pretend to understand the art and say that by it they can prevent their masters from exercising their will over their slaves Such are often applied to by others to give them power to prevent their masters from flogging them The remedy is most generally some kind of bitter root they are directed to chew it and spit towards their masters when they are angry with their slaves At other times they prepare certain kinds of powders to sprinkle about their masters dwellings This is all done for the purpose of defending themselves in some Peaceable manner although I am satisfied that there is no virtue at all in it I have tried it to perfection when I was a slave at the South I was then a young man full of life and vigor and was very fond of visiting our neighbors slaves but had no time to visit only Sundays when I could get a permit to go or after night when I could slip off without being seen If it was found out the next morning I was called up to give an account of myself for going off without permission and would very often get a flogging for it I got myself into a scrape at a certain times by going off in this way and I expected to be severely punished for it I had a strong notion of running off to escape being flogged but was advised by a friend to go to one of those conjurers who could prevent me from being flogged I went and informed him of the difficulty He said if I would pay him a small sum he would prevent my being flogged After I had paid him he mixed up some alum salt and other stuff into a powder and said I must sprinkle it about my master if he should offer to strike me this would prevent him He also gave me some kind of bitter root to chew and spit towards him which would certainly prevent my being flogged According to order I used his remedy and for some cause I was let pass without being flogged that time I had then great faith in conjuration and witchcraft I was led to believe that I could do almost as I pleased without being flogged So on the next Sabbath my conjuration was fully tested by my going off and staying away until Monday morning without permission When I returned home my master declared that he would punish me for going off but I did not believe that he could do it while I had this root and dust and as he approached me I commenced talking saucy to him But he soon convinced me that there was no virtue in them He soon became so enraged at me for saucing him that he grasped a handful of switches and punished me severely in spite of all my roots and powders But there was another old slave in that neighborhood who professed to understand all about conjuration and I thought I would try his skill He told me that the first one was only a quack and if I would only pay him a certain amount in cash that he would tell me how to prevent any person from striking me After I had paid him his charge he told me to go to the cow pen after night and get some fresh cow manure and mix it with red pepper and white people's hair all to be put into a pot over the fire and scorched until it could be ground into snuff I was then to sprinkle it about my master's bedroom in his hat and boots and it would prevent him from ever abusing me in any way After I got it all ready prepared the smallest pinch of if scattered over a room was enough to make a horse sneeze from the strength of it but it did no good I tried it to my satisfaction It was my business to make fires in my master's chamber night and morning Whenever I could get a chance I sprinkled a Little of this dust about the linen of the bed where they would breathe it on retiring This was to act upon them as what is called a kind of love powder to change their sentiments of anger to those of love towards me but this all proved to be vain imagination The old man had my money and I was treated no better for it One night when I went in to make a fire I availed myself of the opportunity of sprinkling a very heavy charge of this powder about my master's bed Soon after their going to bed they began to cough and sneeze Being close around the house watching and listening to know what the effect would be I heard them ask each other what in the world it could be that made them cough and sneeze so All the while I was trembling with fear expecting every moment I should be called and asked if I knew any thing about it After this for fear they might find me out in my dangerous experiments upon them I had to give them up for the time being I was then convinced that running away was the most effectual way by which a slave could escape cruel punishment As all the instrumentalities which I as a slave could bring to bear upon the system had utterly failed to palliate my sufferings all hope and consolation fled I must be a slave for life and suffer under the lash or die The influence which this had only tended to make me more unhappy I resolved that I would be free if running away could make me so I had heard that Canada was a land of liberty somewhere in the North and every wave of trouble that rolled across my breast caused me to think more and more about Canada and liberty But more especially after having been flogged I have fled to the highest hills of the forest pressing my way to the North for refuge but the river Ohio was my limit To me it was an impassable gulf I had no rod wherewith to smite the stream and thereby divide the waters I had no Moses to go before me and lead the way from bondage to a promised land Yet I was in a far worse state than Egyptian bondage for they had houses and land I had none they had oxen and sheep I had none they had a wise counsel to tell them what to do and where to go and even to go with them I had none I was surrounded by opposition on every hand My friends were few and far between I have often felt when running away as if I had scarcely a friend on earth Sometimes standing on the Ohio River bluff looking over on a free State and as far north as my eyes could see I have eagerly gazed upon the blue sky of the free North which at times constrained me to cry out from the depths of my soul Oh Canada sweet land of rest Oh when shall I get there Oh that I had the wings of a dove that I might soar away to where there is no slavery no clanking of chains no captives no lacerating of backs no parting of husbands and wives and where man ceases to be the property of his fellow man These thoughts have revolved in my mind a thousand times I have stood upon the lofty banks of the river Ohio gazing upon the splendid steamboats wafted with all their magnificence up and down the river and I thought of the fishes of the water the fowls of the air the wild beasts of the forest all appeared to be free to go just where they pleased and I was an unhappy slave But my attention was gradually turned in a measure from this subject by being introduced into the society of young women This for the time being took my attention from running away as waiting on the girls appeared to be perfectly congenial to my nature I wanted to be well thought of by them and would go to great lengths to gain their affection I had been taught by the old superstitious slaves to believe in conjuration and it was hard for me to give up the notion for all I had been deceived by them One of these conjurers for a small sum agreed to teach me to make any girl love me that I wished After I had paid him he told me to get a bull frog and take a certain bone out of the frog dry it and when I got a chance I must step up to any girl whom I wished to make love me and scratch her somewhere on her naked skin with this bone and she would be certain to love me and would follow me in spite of herself no matter who she might be engaged to nor who she might be walking with So I got me a bone for a certain girl whom I knew to be under the influence of another young man I happened to meet her in the company of her lover one Sunday evening walking out so when I got a chance I fetched her a tremendous rasp across the neck with this bone which made her jump But in place of making her love me it only made her angry with me She felt more like running after me to retaliate on me for thus abusing her than she felt like loving me After I found there was no virtue in the bone of a frog I thought I would try some other way to carry out my object I then sought another counsellor among the old superstitious influential slaves one who professed to be a great friend of mine told me to get a lock of hair from the head of any girl and wear it in my shoes this would cause her to love me above all other persons As there was another girl whose affections I was anxious to gain but could not succeed I thought without trying the experiment of this hair I slipped off one night to see the girl and asked her for a lock of her hair but she refused to give it Believing that my success depended greatly upon this bunch of hair I was bent on having a look before I left that night let it cost what it might As it was time for me to start home in order to get any sleep that night I grasped hold of a lock of her hair which caused her to screech but I never let go until I had pulled it out This of course made the girl mad with me and I accomplished nothing but gained her displeasure Such are the superstitious notions of the great masses of southern slaves It is given to them by tradition and can never be erased while the doors of education are bolted and barred against them But there is a prohibition by law of mental and religious instruction The state of Georgia by an act of declared that it shall not be lawful for any number of free negroes molattoes or mestinos or even slaves in company with white persons to meet together for the purpose of mental instruction either before the rising of the sun or after the going down of the same d Brevard's Digest Similar laws exist in most of the slave States and patrols are sent out after night and on the Sabbath day to enforce them They go through their respective towns to prevent slaves from meeting for religious worship or mental instruction This is the regulation and law of American Slavery as sanctioned by the Government of the United States and without which it could not exist And almost the whole moral political and religious power of the nation are in favor of slavery and aggression against liberty and justice I only judge by their actions which speak louder than words Slaveholders are put into the highest offices in the gift of the people in both Church and State thereby making slaveholding popular and reputable III My Courtship and Marriage Change of owner My first born Its sufferings My wife abused My own anguish The circumstances of my courtship and marriage I consider to be among the most remarkable events of my life while a slave To think that after I had determined to carry out the great idea which is so universally and practically acknowledged among all the civilized nations of the earth that I would be free or die I suffered myself to be turned aside by the fascinating charms of a female who gradually won my attention from an object so high as that of liberty and an object which I held paramount to all others But when I had arrived at the age of eighteen which was in the year of it was my lot to be introduced to the favor of a mulatto slave girl named Malinda who lived in Oldham County Kentucky about four miles from the residence of my owner Malinda was a medium sized girl graceful in her walk of an extraordinary make and active in business Her shin was of a smooth texture red cheeks with dark and penetrating eyes She moved in the highest circle The distinction among slaves is as marked as the classes of society are in any aristocratic community Some refusing to associate with others whom they deem to be beneath them in point of character color condition or the superior importance of their respective masters of slaves and free people of color She was also one of the best singers I ever heard and was much esteemed by all who knew her for her benevolence talent and industry In fact I considered Malinda to be equalled by few and surpassed by none for the above qualities all things considered It is truly marvellous to see how sudden a man's mind can be changed by the charms and influence of a female The first two or three visits that I paid this dear girl I had no intention of courting or marrying her for I was aware that such a step would greatly obstruct my way to the land of liberty I only visited Malinda because I liked her company as a highly interesting girl But in spite of myself before I was aware of it I was deeply in love and what made this passion so effectual and almost irresistable I became satisfied that it was reciprocal There was a union of feeling and every visit made the impression stronger and stronger One or two other young men were paying attention to Malinda at the same time one of whom her mother was anxious to have her marry This of course gave me a fair opportunity of testing Malinda's sincerity I had just about opposition enough to make the subject interesting That Malinda loved me above all others on earth no one could deny I could read it by the warm reception with which the dear girl always met me and treated me in her mother's house I could read it by the warm and affectionate shake of the hand and gentle smile upon her lovely cheek I could read it by her always giving me the preference of her company by her pressing invitations to visit even in opposition to her mother's will I could read it in the language of her bright and sparkling eye penciled by the unchangable finger of nature that spake but could not lie These strong temptations gradually diverted my attention from my actual condition and from liberty though not entirely But oh that I had only then been enabled to have seen as I do now or to have read the following slave code which is but a stereotyped law of American slavery It would have saved me I think from having to lament that I was a husband and am the father of slaves who are still left to linger out their days in hopeless bondage The laws of Kentucky my native State with Maryland and Virginia which are said to be the mildest slave States in the Union noted for their humanity Christianity and democracy declare that Any slave for rambling in the night or riding horseback without leave or running away may be punished by whipping cropping and branding in the cheek or otherwise not rendering him unfit for labor Any slave convicted of petty larceny murder or wilfully burning of dwelling houses may be sentenced to have his right hand cut off to be hanged in the usual manner or the head severed from the body the body divided into four quarters and head and quarters stuck up in the most public place in the county where such act was committed At the time I joined my wife in holy wedlock I was ignorant of these ungodly laws I knew not that I was propogating victims for this kind of torture and cruelty Malinda's mother was free and lived in Bedford about a quarter of a mile from her daughter and we often met and passed off the time pleasantly Agreeable to promise on one Saturday evening I called to see Malinda at her mother's residence with an intention of letting her know my mind upon the subject of marriage It was a very bright moonlight night the dear girl was standing in the door anxiously waiting my arrival As I approached the door she caught my hand with an affectionate smile and bid me welcome to her mother's fireside After having broached the subject of marriage I informed her of the difficulties which I conceived to be in the way of our marriage and that I could never engage myself to marry any girl only on certain conditions near as I can recollect the substance of our conversation upon the subject it was that I was religiously inclined that I intended to try to comply with the requisitions of the gospel both theoretically and practically through life Also that I was decided on becoming a free man before I died and that I expected to get free by running away and going to Canada under the British Government Agreement on those two cardinal questions I made my test for marriage I said I never will give my heart nor hand to any girl in marriage until I first know her sentiments upon all important subjects of Religion and Liberty No matter how well I might love her nor how great the sacrifice in carrying out these God given principles And I here pledge myself from this course never to be shaken while a single pulsation of my heart shall continue to throb for Liberty With this idea Malinda appeared to be well pleased and with a smile she looked me in the face and said I have long entertained the same views and this has been one of the greatest reasons why I have not felt inclined to enter the married state while a slave I have always felt a desire to be free I have long cherished a hope that I should yet be free either by purchase or running away In regard to the subject of Religion I have always felt that it was a good thing and something that I would seek for at some future period After I found that Malinda was right upon these all important questions and that she truly loved me well enough to make me an affectionate wife I made proposals for marriage She very modestly declined answering the question then considering it to be one of a grave character and upon which our future destiny greatly depended And notwithstanding she confessed that I had her entire affections she must have some time to consider the matter To this I of course consented and was to meet her on the next Saturday night to decide the question But for some cause I failed to come and the next week she sent for me and on the Sunday evening following I called on her again she welcomed me with all the kindness of an affectionate lover and seated me by her side We soon broached the old subject of marriage and entered upon a conditional contract of matrimony viz that we would marry if our minds should not change within one year that after marriage we would change our former course and live a pious life and that we would embrace the earliest opportunity of running away to Canada for our liberty Clasping each other by the hand pledging our sacred honor that we would be true we called on high heaven to witness the rectitude of our purpose There was nothing that could be more binding upon us as slaves than this for marriage among American slaves is disregarded by the laws of this country It is counted a mere temporary matter it is a union which may be continued or broken off with or without the consent of a slaveholder whether he is a priest or a libertine There is no legal marriage among the slaves of the South I never saw nor heard of such a thing in my life and I have been through seven of the slave states A slave marrying according to law is a thing unknown in the history of American Slavery And be it known to the disgrace of our country that every slaveholder who is the keeper of a number of slaves of both sexes is also the keeper of a house or houses of ill fame Licentious white men can and do enter at night or day the lodging places of slaves break up the bonds of affection in families destroy all their domestic and social union for life and the laws of the country afford them no protection Will any man count if they can be counted the churches of Maryland Kentucky and Virginia which have slaves connected with them living in an open state of adultery never having been married according to the laws of the State and yet regular members of these various denominations but more especially the Baptist and Methodist churches And I hazard nothing in saying that this state of things exists to a very wide extent in the above states I am happy to state that many fugitive slaves who have been enabled by the aid of an over ruling providence to escape to the free North with those whom they claim as their wives notwithstanding all their ignorance and superstition are not at all disposed to live together like brutes as they have been compelled to do in slaveholding Churches But as soon as they got free from slavery they go before some anti slavery clergyman and have the solemn ceremony of marriage performed according to the laws of the country And if they profess religion and have been baptized by a slaveholding minister they repudiate it after becoming free and are re baptized by a man who is worthy of doing it according to the gospel rule The time and place of my marriage I consider one of the most trying of my life I was opposed by friends and foes my mother opposed me because she thought I was too young and marrying she thought would involve me in trouble and difficulty My mother in law opposed me because she wanted her daughter to marry a slave who belonged to a very rich man living near by and who was well known to be the son of his master She thought no doubt that his master or father might chance to set him free before he died which would enable him to do a better part by her daughter than I could And there was no prospect then of my ever being free But his master has neither died nor yet set his son free who is now about forty years of age toiling under the lash waiting and hoping that his master may die and will him to be free The young men were opposed to our marriage for the same reason that Paddy opposed a match when the clergyman was about to pronounce the marriage ceremony of a young couple He said if there be any present who have any objections to this couple being joined together in holy wedlock let them speak now or hold their peace henceforth At this time Paddy sprang to his feet and said Sir I object to this Every eye was fixed upon him What is your objection said the clergyman Faith replied Paddy Sir I want her myself The man to whom I belonged was opposed because he feared my taking off from his farm some of the fruits of my own labor for Malinda to eat in the shape of pigs chickens or turkeys and would count it not robbery So we formed a resolution that if we were prevented from joining in wedlock that we would run away and strike for Canada let the consequences be what they might But we had one consolation Malinda's master was very much in favor of the match but entirely upon selfish principles When I went to ask his permission to marry Malinda his answer was in the affirmative with but one condition which I consider to be too vulgar to be written in this book Our marriage took place one night during the Christmas holydays at which time we had quite a festival given us All appeared to be wide awake and we had quite a jolly time at my wedding party And notwithstanding our marriage was without license or sanction of law we believed it to be honorable before God and the bed undefiled Our christmas holydays were spent in matrimonial visiting among our friends while it should have been spent in running away to Canada for our liberty But freedom was little thought of by us for several months after marriage I often look back to that period even now as one of the most happy seasons of my life notwithstanding all the contaminating and heartrending features with which the horrid system of slavery is marked and must carry with it to its final grave yet I still look back to that season with sweet remembrance and pleasure that yet hath power to charm and drive back dull cares which have been accumulated by a thousand painful recollections of slavery Malinda was to me an affectionate wife She was with me in the darkest hours of adversity She was with me in sorrow and joy in fasting and feasting in trial and persecution in sickness and health in sunshine and in shade Some mouths after our marriage the unfeeling master to whom I belonged sold his farm with the view of moving his slaves to the State of Missouri regardless of the separation of husbands and wives forever but for fear of my resuming my old practice of running away if he should have forced me to leave my wife by my repeated requests he was constrained to sell me to his brother who lived within seven miles of Win Gatewood who then held Malinda as his property I was permitted to visit her only on Saturday nights after my work was done and I had to be at home before sunrise on Monday mornings or take a flogging He proved to be so oppressive and so unreasonable in punishing his victims that I soon found that I should have to run away in self defence But be soon began to take the hint and sold me to Wm Gatewood the owner of Malinda With my new residence I confess that I was much dissatisfied Not that Gatewood was a more cruel master than my former owner not that I was opposed to living with Malinda who was then the centre and object of my affections but to live where I must be eye witness to her insults scourgings and abuses such as are common to be inflicted upon slaves was more than I could bear If my wife must be exposed to the insults and licentious passions of wicked slave drivers and overseers if she must bear the stripes of the lash laid on by an unmerciful tyrant if this is to be done with impunity which is frequently done by slaveholders and their abettors Heaven forbid that I should be compelled to witness the sight Not many months after I took up my residence on Wm Gatewood's plantation Malinda made me a father The dear little daughter was called Mary Frances She was nurtured and caressed by her mother and father until she was large enough to creep over the floor after her parents and climb up by a chair before I felt it to be my duty to leave my family and go into a foreign country for a season Malinda's business was to labor out in the field the greater part of her time and there was no one take care of poor little Frances while her mother was toiling in the field She was left at the house to creep under the feet of an unmerciful old mistress whom I have known to slap with her hand the face of little Frances for crying after her mother until her little face was left black and blue I recollect that Malinda and myself came from the field one summer's day at noon and poor little Frances came creeping to her mother smiling but with large tear drops standing in her dear little eyes sobbing and trying to tell her mother that she had been abused but was not able to utter a word Her little face was bruised black with the whole print of Mrs Gatewood's hand This print was plainly to be seen for eight days after it was done But oh this darling child was a slave born of a slave mother Who can imagine what could be the feelings of a father and mother when looking upon their infant child whipped and tortured with impunity and they placed in a situation where they could afford it no protection But we were all claimed and held as property the father and mother were slaves On this same plantation I was compelled to stand and see my wife shamefully scourged and abused by her master and the manner in which this was done was so violently and inhumanly committed upon the person of a female that I despair in finding decent language to describe the bloody act of cruelty My happiness or pleasure was then all blasted for it was sometimes a pleasure to be with my little family even in slavery I loved them as my wife and child Little Frances was a pretty child she was quiet playful bright and interesting She had a keen black eye and the very image of her mother was stamped upon her cheek but I could never look upon the dear child without being filled with sorrow and fearful apprehensions of being separated by slaveholders because she was a slave regarded as property And unfortunately for me I am the father of a slave a word too obnoxious to be spoken by a fugitive slave It calls fresh to my mind the separation of husband and wife of stripping tying up and flogging of tearing children from their parents an selling them on the auction block It calls to mind female virtue trampled under foot with impunity But oh When I remember that my daughter my only child is still there destined to share the fate of all these calamities it is too much to bear If ever there was any one act of my life while a slave that I have to lament over it is that of being a father and a husband of slaves I I have the satisfaction of knowing that I am only the father of one slave She is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh poor unfortunate child She was the first and shall be the last slave that ever I will father for chains and slavery on this earth Illustration Can a mother forget her suckling child The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel IV My first adventure for liberty Parting scene Journey up the river Safe arrival in Cincinnati Journey to Canada Suffering from cold and hunger Denied food and shelter by some One noble exception Subsequent success Arrival at Perrysburgh I obtained employment through the winter My return to Kentucky to get my family In the fall or winter of I formed a resolution that I would escape if possible to Canada for my Liberty I commenced from that hour making preparations for the dangerous experiment of breaking the chains that bound me as a slave My preparation for this voyage consisted in the accumulation of a little money perhaps not exceeding two dollars and fifty cents and a suit which I had never been seen or known to wear before this last was to avoid detection On the twenty fifth of December my long anticipated time had arrived when I was to put into operation my former resolution which was to bolt for Liberty or consent to die a Slave I acted upon the former although I confess it to be one of the most self denying acts of my whole life to take leave of an affectionate wife who stood before me on my departure with dear little Frances in her arms and with tears of sorrow in her eyes as she bid me a long farewell It required all the moral courage that I was master of to suppress my feeling while taking leave of my little family Had Malinda known my intention at that time it would not have been possible for me to have got away and I might have this day been a slave Notwithstanding every inducement was held out to me to run away if I would be free and the voice of liberty was thundering in my very soul Be free oh man be free I was struggling against a thousand obstacles which had clustered around my mind to bind my wounded spirit still in the dark prison of mental degradation My strong attachments to friends and relatives with all the love of home and birth place which is so natural among the human family twined about my heart and were hard to break away from And withal the fear of being pursued with guns and blood hounds and of being killed or captured and taken to the extreme South to linger out my days in hopeless bondage on some cotton or sugar plantation all combined to deter me But I had counted the cost and was fully prepared to make the sacrifice The time for fulfilling my pledge was then at hand I must forsake friends and neighbors wife and child or consent to live and die a slave By the permission of my keeper I started out to work for myself on Christmas I went to the Ohio River which was but a short distance from Bedford My excuse for wanting to go there was to get work High wages were offered for hands to work in a slaughter house But in place of my going to work there according to promise when I arrived at the river I managed to find a conveyance to cross over into a free state I was landed in the village of Madison Indiana where steamboats were landing every day and night passing up and down the river which afforded me a good opportunity of getting a boat passage to Cincinnati My anticipation being worked up to the highest pitch no sooner was the curtain of night dropped over the village than I secreted myself where no one could see me and changed my suit ready for the passage Soon I heard the welcome sound of a Steamboat coming up the river Ohio which was soon to waft me beyond the limits of the human slave markets of Kentucky When the boat had landed at Madison notwithstanding my strong desire to get off my heart trembled within me in view of the great danger to which I was exposed in taking passage on board of a Southern Steamboat hence before I took passage I kneeled down before the Great I Am and prayed for his aid and protection which He bountifully bestowed even beyond my expectation for I felt myself to be unworthy I then stept boldly on the deck of this splendid swift running Steamer bound for the city of Cincinnati This being the first voyage that I had ever taken on board of a Steamboat I was filled with fear and excitement knowing that I was surrounded by the vilest enemies of God and man liable to be seized and bound hand and foot by any white man and taken back into captivity But I crowded myself back from the light among the deck passengers where it would be difficult to distinguish me from a white man Every time during the night that the mate came round with a light after the hands I was afraid he would see I was a colored man and take me up hence I kept from the light as much as possible Some men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil but this was not the case with myself it was to avoid detection in doing right This was one of the instances of my adventures that my affinity with the Anglo Saxon race and even slaveholders worked well for my escape But no thanks to them for it While in their midst they have not only robbed me of my labor and liberty but they have almost entirely robbed me of my dark complexion Being so near the color of a slaveholder they could not or did not find me out that night among the white passengers There was one of the deck hands on board called out on his watch whose hammock was swinging up near by me I asked him if he would let me lie in it He said if I would pay him twenty five cents that I might lie in it until day I readily paid him the price and got into the hammock No one could see my face to know whether I was white or colored while I was in the hammock but I never closed eyes for sleep that night I had often heard explosions on board of Steamboats and every time the boat landed and blowed off steam I was afraid the boilers had bursted and we should all be killed but I lived through the night amid the many dangers to which I was exposed I still maintained my position in the hammock until the next morning about o'clock when I heard the passengers saying the boat was near Cincinnati and by this time I supposed that the attention of the people would be turned to the city and I might pass off unnoticed There were no questions asked me while on board the boat The boat landed about o'clock in the morning in Cincinnati and I waited until after most of the passengers had gone off of the boat I then walked as gracefully up street as if I was not running away until I had got pretty well up Broadway My object was to go to Canada but having no knowledge of the road it was necessary for me to make some inquiry before I left the city I was afraid to ask a white person and I could see no colored person to ask But fortunately for me I found a company of little boys at play in the street and through these little boys by asking them indirect questions I found the residence of a colored man Boys can you tell me where that old colored man lives who saws wood and works at jobs around the streets What is his name said one of the boys I forget Is it old Job Dundy Is Dundy a colored man Yes sir That is the very man I am looking for will you show me where he lives Yes said the little boy and pointed me out the house Mr D invited me in and I found him to be a true friend He asked me if I was a slave from Kentucky and if I ever intended to go back into slavery Not knowing yet whether he was truly in favor of slaves running away I told him that I had just come over to spend my christmas holydays and that I was going back His reply was my son I would never go back if I was in your place you have a right to your liberty ' I then asked him how I should get my freedom He referred me to Canada over which waved freedom's flag defended by the British Government upon whose soil there cannot be the foot print of a slave He then commenced telling me of the facilities for my escape to Canada of the Abolitionists of the Abolition Societies and of their fidelity to the cause of suffering humanity This was the first time in my life that ever I had heard of such people being in existence as the Abolitionists I supposed that they were a different race of people He conducted me to the house of one of these warm hearted friends of God and the slave I found him willing to aid a poor fugitive on his way to Canada even to the dividing of the last cent or morsel of bread if necessary These kind friends gave me something to eat and started me on my way to Canada with a recommendation to a friend on my way This was the commencement of what was called the under ground rail road to Canada I walked with bold courage trusting in the arm of Omnipotence guided by the unchangable North Star by night and inspired by an elevated thought that I was fleeing from a land of slavery and oppression bidding farewell to hand cuffs whips thumb screws and chains I travelled on until I had arrived at the place where I was directed to call on an Abolitionist but I made no stop so great were my fears of being pursued by the pro slavery hunting dogs of the South I prosecuted my journey vigorously for nearly forty eight hours without food or rest struggling against external difficulties such as no one can imagine who has never experienced the same not knowing what moment I might be captured while travelling among strangers through cold and fear breasting the north winds being thinly clad pelted by the snow storms through the dark hours of the night and not a house in which I could enter to shelter me from the storm The second night from Cincinnati about midnight I thought that I should freeze my shoes were worn through and my feet were exposed to the bare ground I approached a house on the road side knocked at the door and asked admission to their fire but was refused I went to the next house and was refused the privilege of their fire side to prevent my freezing This I thought was hard treatment among the human family But Behind a frowning Providence there was a smiling face which soon shed beams of light upon unworthy me The next morning I was still found struggling on my way faint hungry lame and rest broken I could see people taking breakfast from the road side but I did not dare to enter their houses to get my breakfast for neither love nor money In passing a low cottage I saw the breakfast table spread with all its bounties and I could see no male person Illustration Never mind the money about the house the temptation for food was greater than I could resist I saw a lady about the table and I thought that if she was ever so much disposed to take me up that she would have to catch and hold me and that would have been impossible I stepped up to the door with my hat off and asked her if she would be good enough to sell me a sixpence worth of bread and meat She cut off a piece and brought it to me I thanked her for it and handed her the pay but instead of receiving it she burst into tears and said never mind the money but gently turned away bidding me go on my journey This was altogether unexpected to me I had found a friend in the time of need among strangers and nothing could be more cheering in the day of trouble than this When I left that place I started with bolder courage The next night I put up at a tavern and continued stopping at public houses until my means were about gone When I got to the Black Swamp in the county of Wood Ohio I stopped one night at a hotel after travelling all day through mud and snow but I soon found that I should not be able to pay my bill This was about the time that the wild cat banks were in a flourishing state and shin plasters Nick name for temporary paper money in abundance they would charge a dollar for one night's lodging After I had found out this I slipped out of the bar room into the kitchen where the landlady was getting supper as she had quite a number of travellers to cook for that night I told her if she would accept my services I would assist her in getting supper that I was a cook She very readily accepted the offer and I went to work She was very much pleased with my work and the next morning I helped her to get breakfast She then wanted to hire me for all winter but I refused for fear I might be pursued My excuse to her was that I had a brother living in Detroit whom I was going to see on some important business and after I got that business attended to I would come back and work for them all winter When I started the second morning they paid me fifty cents beside my board with the understanding that I was to return but I have not gone back yet I arrived the next morning in the village of Perrysburgh where I found quite a settlement of colored people many of whom were fugitive slaves I made my case known to them and they sympathized with me I was a stranger and they took me in and persuaded me to spend the winter in Perrysburgh where I could get employment and go to Canada the next spring in a steamboat which run from Perrysburgh if I thought it proper so to do I got a job of chopping wood during that winter which enabled me to purchase myself a suit and after paying my board the next spring I had saved fifteen dollars in cash My intention was to go back to Kentucky after my wife When I got ready to start which was about the first of May my friends all persuaded me not to go but to get some other person to go for fear I might be caught and sold off from my family into slavery forever But I could not refrain from going back myself believing that I could accomplish it better than a stranger The money that I had would not pass in the South and for the purpose of getting it off to a good advantage I took a steamboat passage to Detroit Michigan and there I spent all my money for dry goods to peddle out on my way back through the State of Ohio I also purchased myself a pair of false whiskers to put on when I got back to Kentucky to prevent any one from knowing me after night should they see me I then started back after my little family V My safe arrival at Kentucky Surprise and delight to find my family Plan for their escape projected Return to Cincinnati My betrayal by traitors Imprisonment in Covington Kentucky Return to slavery Infamous proposal of the slave catchers My reply I succeeded very well in selling out my goods and when I arrived in Cincinnati I called on some of my friends who had aided me on my first escape They also opposed me in going back only for my own good But it has ever been characteristic of me to persevere in what I undertake I took a Steamboat passage which would bring me to where I should want to land about dark so as to give me a chance to find my family during the night if possible The boat landed me at the proper at the proper time accordingly This landing was about six miles from Bedford where my mother and wife lived but with different families My mother was the cook at a tavern in Bedford When I approached the house where mother was living I remembered where she slept in the kitchen her bed was near the window It was a bright moonlight night and in looking through the kitchen window I saw a person lying in bed about where my mother had formerly slept I rapped on the glass which awakened the person in whom I recognised my dear mother but she knew me not as I was dressed in disguise with my false whiskers on but she came to the window and asked who I was and what I wanted But when I took off my false whiskers and spoke to her she knew my voice and quickly sprang to the door clasping my hand exclaiming Oh is this my son drawing me into the room where I was so fortunate as to find Malinda and little Frances my wife and child whom I had left to find the fair climes of liberty and whom I was then seeking to rescue from perpetual slavery They never expected to see me again in this life I am entirely unable to describe what my feelings were at that time It was almost like the return of the prodigal son There was weeping and rejoicing They were filled with surprise and fear with sadness and joy The sensation of joy at that moment flashed like lightning over my afflicted mind mingled with a thousand dreadful apprehensions that none but a heart wounded slave father and husband like myself can possibly imagine After talking the matter over we decided it was not best to start with my family that night as it was very uncertain whether we should get a boat passage immediately And in case of failure if Malinda should get back even before daylight the next morning it would have excited suspicion against her as it was not customary for slaves to leave home at that stage of the week without permission Hence we thought it would be the most effectual way for her to escape to start on Saturday night this being a night on which the slaves of Kentucky are permitted to visit around among their friends and are often allowed to stay until the afternoon on Sabbath day I gave Malinda money to pay her passage on board of a Steamboat to Cincinnati as it was not safe for me to wait for her until Saturday night but she was to meet me in Cincinnati if possible the next Sunday Her father was to go with her to the Ohio River on Saturday night and if a boat passed up during the night she was to get on board at Madison and come to Cincinnati If she should fail in getting off that night she was to try it the next Saturday night This was the understanding when we separated This we thought was the best plan for her escape as there had been so much excitement caused by my running away The owners of my wife were very much afraid that she would follow me and to prevent her they had told her and other slaves that I had been persuaded off by the Abolitionists who had promised to set me free but had sold me off to New Orleans They told the slaves to beware of the abolitionists that their object was to decoy off slaves and then sell them off in New Orleans Some of them believed this and others believed it not and the owners of my wife were more watchful over her than the had ever been before as she was unbelieving This was in the month of June I left Malinda on a bright but lonesome Wednesday night When I arrived at the river Ohio I found a small craft chained to a tree in which I ferried myself across the stream I succeeded in getting a Steamboat passage back to Cincinnati where I put up with one of my abolition friends who knew that I had gone after my family and who appeared to be much surprised to see me again I was soon visited by several friends who knew of my having gone back after my family They wished to know why I had not brought my family with me but after they understood the plan and that my family was expected to be in Cincinnati within a few days they thought it the best and safest plan for us to take a stage passage out to Lake Erie But being short of money I was not able to pay my passage in the stage even if it would have prevented me from being caught by the slave hunters of Cincinnati or save me from being taken back into bondage for life These friends proposed helping me by subscription I accepted their kind offer but in going among friends to solicit aid for me they happened to get among traitors and kidnappers both white and colored men who made their living by that kind of business Several persons called on me and made me small donations and among them two white men came in professing to be my friends They told me not to be afraid of them they were abolitionists They asked me a great many questions They wanted to know if I needed any help and they wanted to know if it could be possible that a man so near white as myself could be a slave Could it be possible that men would make slaves of their own children They expressed great sympathy for me and gave me fifty cents each by this they gained my confidence They asked my master's name where he lived c After which they left the room bidding me God speed These traitors or land pirates took passage on board of the first Steamboat down the river in search of my owners When they found them they got a reward of three hundred dollars offered for the re capture of this stray which they had so long and faithfully been hunting by day and by night by land and by water with dogs and with guns but all without success This being the last and only chance for dragging me back into hopeless bondage time and money was no object when they saw a prospect of my being re taken Mr Gatewood got two of his slaveholding neighbors to go with him to Cincinnati for the purpose of swearing to anything which might be necessary to change me back into property They came on to Cincinnati and with but little effort they soon rallied a mob of ruffians who were willing to become the watch dogs of slaveholders for a dram in connection with a few slavehunting petty constables While I was waiting the arrival of my family I got a job of digging a cellar for the good lady where I was stopping and while I was digging under the house all at once I heard a man enter the house another stept up to the cellar door to where I was at work he looked in and saw me with my coat off at work He then rapped over the cellar door on the house side to notify the one who had entered the house to look for me that I was in the cellar This strange conduct soon excited suspicion so strong in me that I could not stay in the cellar and started to come out but the man who stood by the door rapped again on the house side for the other to come to his aid and told me to stop I attempted to pass out by him and he caught hold of me and drew a pistol swearing if I did not stop he would shoot me down By this time I knew that I was betrayed I asked him what crime I had committed that I should be murdered I will let you know very soon said he By this time there were others coming to his aid and I could see no way by which I could possibly escape the jaws of that hell upon earth All my flattering prospects of enjoying my own fire side with my little family were then blasted and gone and I must bid farewell to friends and freedom forever In vain did I look to the infamous laws of the Commonwealth of Ohio for that protection against violence and outrage that even the vilest criminal with a white skin might enjoy But oh the dreadful thought that after all my sacrifice and struggling to rescue my family from the hands of the oppressor that I should be dragged back into cruel bondage to suffer the penalty of a tyrant's law to endure stripes and imprisonment and to be shut out from all moral as well as intellectual improvement and linger out almost a living death Illustration Squire's office When I saw a crowd of blood thirsty unprincipled slave hunters rushing upon me armed with weapons of death it was no use for me to undertake to fight my way through against such fearful odds But I broke away from the man who stood by with his pistol drawn to shoot me if I should resist and reached the fence and attempted to jump over it before I was overtaken but the fence being very high I was caught by my legs before I got over I kicked and struggled with all my might to get away but without success I kicked a new cloth coat off of his back while he was holding on to my leg I kicked another in his eye but they never let me go until they got more help By this time there was a crowd on the out side of the fence with clubs to beat me back Finally they succeeded in dragging me from the fence and overpowered me by numbers and choked me almost to death These ruffians dragged me through the streets of Cincinnati to what was called a justice office But it was more like an office of injustice When I entered the room I was introduced to three slaveholders one of whom was a son of Wm Gatewood who claimed me as his property They pretended to be very glad to see me They asked me if I did not want to see my wife and child but I made no reply to any thing that was said until I was delivered up as a slave After they were asked a few questions by the court the old pro slavery squire very gravely pronounced me to be the property of Mr Gatewood The office being crowded with spectators many of whom were colored persons Mr G was afraid to keep me in Cincinnati two or three hours even until a steamboat got ready to leave for the South So they took me across the river and looked me up in Covington jail for safe keeping This was the first time in my life that I had been put into a jail It was truly distressing to my feelings to be locked up in a cold dungeon for no crime The jailor not being at home his wife had to act in his place After my owners had gone back to Cincinnati the jailor's wife in company with another female came into the jail and talked with me very friendly I told them all about my situation and these ladies said they hoped that I might get away again and went so far as to tell me if I should be kept in the jail that night there was a hole under the wall of the jail where a prisoner had got out It was only filled up with loose dirt they said and I might scratch it out and clear myself This I thought was a kind word from an unexpected friend I had power to have taken the key from those ladies in spite of them and have cleared myself but knowing that they would have to suffer perhaps for letting me get away I thought I would wait until after dark at which time I should try to make my escape if they should not take me out before that time But within two or three hours they came after me and conducted me on board of a boat on which we all took passage down to Louisville I was not confined in any way but was well guarded by five men three of whom were slaveholders and the two young men from Cincinnati who had betrayed me After the boat had got fairly under way with these vile men standing around me on the upper deck of the boat and she under full speed carrying me back into a land of torment I could see no possible way of escape Yet while I was permitted to gaze on the beauties of nature on free soil as I passed down the river things looked to me uncommonly pleasant The green trees and wild flowers of the forest the ripening harvest fields waving with the gentle breezes of Heaven and the honest farmers tilling their soil and living by their own toil These things seem to light upon my vision with a peculiar charm I was conscious of what must be my fate a wretched victim for Slavery without limit to be sold like an ox into hopeless bondage and to be worked under the flesh devouring lash during life without wages This was to me an awful thought every time the boat run near the shore I was tempted to leap from the deck down into the water with a hope of making my escape Such was then my feeling But on a moment's reflection reason with her warning voice overcame this passion by pointing out the dreadful consequences of one's committing suicide And this I thought would have a very striking resemblance to the act and I declined putting into practice this dangerous experiment though the temptation was great These kidnapping gentlemen seeing that I was much dissatisfied commenced talking to me by saying that I must not be cast down they were going to take me back home to live with my family if I would promise not to run away again To this I agreed and told them that this was all that I could ask and more than I had expected But they were not satisfied with having recaptured me because they had lost other slaves and supposed that I knew their whereabouts and truly I did They wanted me to tell them but before telling I wanted them to tell who it was that had betrayed me into their hands They said that I was betrayed by two colored men in Cincinnati whose names they were backward in telling because their business in connection with themselves was to betray and catch fugitive slaves for the reward offered They undertook to justify the act by saying if they had not betrayed me that somebody else would and if I would tell them where they could catch a number of other runaway slaves they would pay for me and set me free and would then take me in as one of the Club They said I would soon make money enough to buy my wife and child out of slavery But I replied No gentlemen I cannot commit or do an act of that kind even if it were in my power so to do I know that I am now in the power of a master who can sell me from my family for life or punish me for the crime of running away just as he pleases I know that I am a prisoner for life and have no way of extricating myself and I also know that I have been deceived and betrayed by men who professed to be my best friends but can all this justify me in becoming a traitor to others Can I do that which I complain of others for doing unto me Never I trust while a single pulsation of my heart continues to beat can I consent to betray a fellow man like myself back into bondage who has escaped Dear as I love my wife and little child and as much as I should like to enjoy freedom and happiness with them I am unwilling to bring this about by betraying and destroying the liberty and happiness of others who have never offended me I then asked them again if they would do me the kindness to tell me who it was betrayed me into their hands at Cincinnati They agreed to tell me with the understanding that I was to tell where there was living a family of slaves at the North who had run away from Mr King of Kentucky I should not have agreed to this but I knew the slaves were in Canada where it was not possible for them to be captured After they had told me the names of the persons who betrayed me and how was done then I told them their slaves were in Canada doing well The two white men were Constables who claimed the right of taking up any strange colored person as a slave while the two colored kidnappers under the pretext of being abolitionists would find out all the fugitives they could and inform these Constables for which they got a part of the reward after they found out where the slaves were from the name of his master c By the agency of these colored men they were seized by a band of white ruffians locked up in jail and their master sent for These colored kidnappers with the Constables were getting rich by betraying fugitive slaves This was told to me by one of the Constables while they were all standing around trying to induce me to engage in the same business for the sake of regaining my own liberty and that of my wife and child But my answer even there under the most trying circumstances surrounded by the strongest enemies of God and man was most emphatically in the negative Let my punishment be what it may either with the lash or by selling me away from my friends and home let my destiny be what you please I call never engage in this business for the sake of getting free They said I should not be sold nor punished with the lash for what I had done but I should be carried back to Bedford to live with my wife Yet when the boat got to where we should have landed she wafted by without making any stop I felt awful in view of never seeing my family again they asked what was the matter what made me look so cast down I informed them that I knew I was to be sold in the Louisville slave market or in New Orleans and I never expected to see my family again But they tried to pacify me by promising not to sell me to a slave trader who would take me off to New Orleans cautioning me at the same time not to let it be known that I had had been a runaway This would very much lessen the value of me in market They would not punish me by putting irons on my limbs but would give me a good name and sell me to some gentleman in Louisville for a house servant They thought I would soon make money enough to buy myself and would not part with me if they could get along without But I had cost them so much in advertising and looking for me that they were involved by it In the first place they paid eight hundred and fifty dollars for me and when I first run away they paid one hundred for advertising and looking after me and now they had to pay about forty dollars expenses travelling to and from Cincinnati in addition to the three hundred dollars reward and they were not able to pay the reward without selling me I knew then the only alternative I left for me to extricate myself was to use deception which is the most effectual defence a slave can use I pretended to be satisfied for the purpose of getting an opportunity of giving them the slip But oh the distress of mind the lamentable thought that I should never again see the face nor hear the gentle voice of my nearest and dearest friends in this life I could imagine what must be my fate from my peculiar situation To be sold to the highest bidder and then wear the chains of slavery down to the grave The day star of liberty which had once cheered and gladdened my heart in freedom's land had then hidden itself from my vision and the dark and dismal frown of slavery had obscured the sunshine of freedom from me as they supposed for all time to come But the understanding between us was I was not to be tied chained nor flogged for if they should take me into the city handcuffed and guarded by five men the question might be asked what crime I had committed And if it should be known that I had been a runaway to Canada it would lessen the value of me at least one hundred dollaas Illustration Slave State Free State VI Arrival at Louisville Ky Efforts to sell me Fortunate escape from the man stealers in the public street I return to Bedford Ky The rescue of my family again attempted I started alone expecting them to follow After waiting some months I resolve to go back again to Kentucky When the boat arrived at Louisville the day being too far spent for them to dispose of me they had to put up at a Hotel When we left the boat they were afraid of my bolting from them in the street and to prevent this they took hold of my arms one on each side of me gallanting me up to the hotel with as much propriety as if I had been a white lady This was to deceive the people and prevent my getting away from them They called for a bed room to which I was conducted and locked within That night three of them lodged in the same room to guard me They locked the door and put the key under the head of their bed I could see no possible way for my escape without jumping out of a high three story house window It was almost impossible for me to sleep that night in my peculiar situation I passed the night in prayer to our Heavenly Father asking that He would open to me even the smallest chance for escape The next morning after they had taken breakfast four of them left me in the care of Dan Lane He was what might be called one of the watch dogs of Kentucky There was nothing too mean for him to do He never blushed to rob a slave mother of her children no matter how young or small He was also celebrated for slave selling kidnapping and negro hunting He was well known in that region by the slaves as well as the slaveholders to have all the qualifications necessary for his business He was a drunkard a gambler a profligate and a slaveholder While the other four were looking around through the city for a purchaser Dan was guarding me with his bowie knife and pistols After awhile the others came in with two persons to buy me but on seeing me they remarked that they thought I would run away and asked me if I had ever run away Dan sprang to his feet and answered the question for me by telling one of the most palpable falsehoods that ever came from the lips of a slaveholder He declared that I had never run away in my life Fortunately for me Dan while the others were away became unwell and from taking salts or from some other cause was compelled to leave his room Off he started to the horse stable which was located on one of the most public streets of Louisville and of course I had to accompany him He gallanted me into the stable by the arm and placed himself back in one of the horses stalls and ordered me to standby until he was ready to come out At this time a thousand thoughts were flashing through my mind with regard to the propriety of trying the springs of my heels which nature had so well adapted for taking the body out of danger even in the most extraordinary emergencies thought in the attempt to get away by running if I should not succeed it could make my condition no worse for they could but sell me and this they were then trying to do These thoughts impelled me to keep edging towards the door though very cautiously Dan kept looking around after me as if he was not satisfied at my getting so near to the door But the last I saw of him in the stable was just as he turned his eyes from me I nerved myself with all the moral courage I could command and bolted for the door perhaps with the fleetness of a much frightened deer who never looks behind in time of peril Dan was left in the stable to make ready for the race or jump out into the street half dressed and thereby disgrace himself before the public eye It would be impossible for me to set forth the speed with which I run to avoid my adversary I I succeeded in turning a corner before Dan got sight of me and by fast running turning corners and jumping high fences I was enabled to effect my escape In running so swiftly through the public streets I thought it would be a safer course to leave the public way and a quick as thought I spied a high board fence by the way and attempted to leap over it The top board broke and down I came into a hen coop which stood by the fence The dogs barked and the hens flew and cackled so that I feared it would lead to my detection before I could get out of the yard The reader can only imagine how great must have been the excited state of my mind while exposed to such extraordinary peril and danger on every side In danger of being seized by a savage dog which sprang at me when I fell into the hen coop in danger of being apprehended by the tenants of the lot in danger of being shot or wounded by any one who might have attempted to stop me a runaway slave and in danger on the other hand of being overtaken and getting in conflict with my adversary With these fearful apprehensions caution dictated me not to proceed far by day light in this slaveholding city At this moment every nerve and muscle of my whole system was in full stretch and every facility of the mind brought into action striving to save my self from being re captured I dared not go to the forest knowing that I might be tracked by blood hounds and overtaken I was so fortunate as to find a hiding place in the city which seemed to be pointed out by the finger of Providence After running across lots turning corners and shunning my fellow men as if they were wild ferocious beasts I found a hiding place in a pile of boards or scantling where I kept concealed during that day No tongue nor pen can describe the dreadful apprehensions under which I labored for the space of ten or twelve hours My hiding place happened to be between two workshops where there were men at work within six or eight feet of me I could imagine that I heard them talking about me and at other times thought I heard the footsteps of Daniel Lane in close pursuit But I retained my position there until or o'clock at night without being discovered after which I attempted to find my way out which was exceedingly difficult The night being very dark in a strange city among slaveholders and slave hunters to me it was like a person entering a wilderness among wolves and vipers blindfolded I was compelled from necessity to enter this place for refuge under the most extraordinary state of excitement without regard to its geographical position I found myself surrounded with a large block of buildings which comprised a whole square built up mostly on three sides so that I could see no way to pass out without exposing myself perhaps to the gaze of patrols or slave catchers In wandering around through the dark I happened to find a calf in a back yard which was bawling after the cow the cow was also lowing in another direction as if they were trying to find each other A thought struck me that there must be an outlet somewhere about where the cow and calf were trying to meet I started in the direction where I heard the lowing of the cow and I found an arch or tunnel extending between two large brick buildings where I could see nothing of the cow but her eyes shining like balls of fire through the dark tunnel between the walls through which I passed to where she stood When I entered the streets I found them well lighted up My heart was gladdened to know there was another chance for my escape No bird ever let out of a cage felt more like flying than I felt like running Before I left the city I chanced to find by the way an old man of color Supposing him to be a friend I ventured to make known my situation and asked him if he would get me a bite to eat The old man most cheerfully complied with my request I was then about forty miles from the residence of Wm Gatewood where my wife whom I sought to rescue from slavery was living This was also in the direction it was necessary for me to travel in order to get back to the free North Knowing that the slave catchers would most likely be watching the public highway for me to avoid them I made my way over the rocky hills woods and plantations back to Bedford I travelled all that night guided on my way by the shining stars of heaven alone The next morning just before the break of day I came right to a large plantation about which I secreted myself until the darkness of the next night began to disappear The morning larks commenced to chirp and sing merrily pretty soon I heard the whip crack and the voice of the ploughman driving in the corn field About breakfast time I heard the sound of a horn saw a number of slaves in the field with a white man who I supposed to be their overseer He started to the house before the slaves which gave me an opportunity to get the attention of one of the slaves whom I met at the fence before he started to his breakfast and made known to him my wants and distresses I also requested him to bring me a piece of bread if he could when he came back to the field The hospitable slave complied with my request He came back to the field before his follow laborers and brought me something to eat and as an equivolent for his kindness I instructed him with regard to liberty Canada the way of escape and the facilities by the way He pledged his word that himself and others would be in Canada in less than six months from that day This closed our interview and we separated I concealed myself in the forest until about sunset before I pursued my journey and the second night from Louisville I arrived again in the neighborhood of Bedford where my little family were held in bondage whom I so earnestly strove to rescue I concealed myself by the aid of a friend in that neighborhood intending again to make my escape with my family This confidential friend then carried a message to Malinda requesting her to meet me on one side of the village We met under the most fearful apprehensions for my pursuers had returned from Louisville with the lamentable story that I was gone and yet they were compelled to pay three hundred dollars to the Cincinnati slave catchers for re capturing me there Daniel Lane's account of my escape from him looked so unreasonable to slaveholders that many of them charged him with selling me and keeping the money while others believed that I had got away from him and was then in the neighborhood trying to take off my wife and child which was true Lane declared that in less than five minutes after I run out of the stable in Louisville he had over twenty men running and looking in every direction after me but all without success They could hear nothing of me They had turned over several tons of hay in a large loft in search and I was not to be found there Dan imputed my escape to my godliness He said that I must have gone up in a chariot of fire for I went off by flying and that he should never again have any thing to do with a praying negro Great excitement prevailed in Bedford and many were out watching for me at the time Malinda was relating to me these facts The excitement was then so great among the slaveholders who were anxious to have me re captured as a means of discouraging other slaves from running away that time and money were no object while there was the least prospect of their success I therefore declined making an effort just at that time to escape with my little family Malinda managed to get me into the house of a friend that night in the village where I kept concealed several days seeking an opportunity to escape with Malinda and Frances to Canada But for some time Malinda was watched so very closely by white and by colored persons both day and night that it was not possible for us to escape together They well knew that my little family was the only object of attraction that I ever had or ever would induce me to come back and risk my liberty over the threshold of slavery therefore this point was well guarded by the watch dogs of slavery and I was compelled again to forsake my wife for a season or surrender which was suicidal to the cause of freedom in my judgment The next day after my arrival in Bedford Daniel Lane came to the very house wherein I was concealed and talked in my hearing to the family about my escape from him out of the stable in Louisville He was near enough for me to have laid my hands on his head while in that house and the intimidation which this produced on me was more than I could bear I was also aware of the great temptation of the reward offered to white or colored persons for my apprehension I was exposed to other calamities which rendered it altogether unsafe for me to A longer under that roof One morning about o'clock I took leave of my little family and started for Canada This was almost like tearing off the limbs from my body When we were about to separate Malinda clasped my hand exclaiming oh my soul my heart is almost broken at the thought of this dangerous separation This may be the last time we shall ever see each other's faces in this life which will destroy all my future prospects of life and happiness forever At this time the poor unhappy woman burst into tears and wept loudly and my eyes were not dry We separated with the understanding that she was to wait until the excitement was all over after which she was to meet me at certain place in the State of Ohio which would not be longer than two months from that time I succeeded that night in getting a steamboat conveyance Illustration My heart is almost broken back to Cincinnati or within ten miles of the city I was apprehensive that there were slave hunters in Cincinnati watching the arrival Of every boat up the river expecting to catch me and the boat landing to take in wood ten miles below the city I got off and walked into Cincinnati to avoid detection No my arrival at the house of a friend I heard that the two young men who betrayed me for the three hundred dollars had returned and were watching for me One of my friends in whom they had great confidence called on the traitors after he had talked with me and asked them what they had done with me Their reply was that I had given them the slip and that they were glad of it because they believed that I was a good man and if they could see me on my way to Canada they would give me money to add me on my escape My friend assured them that if they would give any thing to aid me on my way much or little if they would put the same into his hands he would give it to me that night or return it to them the next morning They then wanted to know where I was and whether I was in the city but he would not tell them but one of them gave him one dollar for me promising that if I was in the city and he would let him know the next morning he would give me ten dollars But I never waited for the ten dollars I received one dollar of the amount which they got for betraying me and started that night for the north Their excuse for betraying me was that catching runaways was their business and if they had not done it somebody else would but since they had got the reward they were glad that I had made my escape Having travelled the road several times from Cincinnati to Lake Erie I travelled through without much fear or difficulty My friends in Perrysburgh who knew that I had gone back into the very jaws of slavery after my family were much surprised at my return for they had heard that I was re captured After I had waited three months for the arrival of Malinda and she came not it caused me to be one of the most unhappy fugitives that ever left the South I had waited eight or nine months without hearing from my family I felt it to be my duty as a husband and father to make one more effort I felt as if I could not give them up to be sacrificed on the bloody altar of slavery I felt as if love duty humanity and justice required that I should go back putting my trust in the God of Liberty for success VII My safe return to Kentucky The perils I encountered there Again betrayed and taken by a mob ironed and imprisoned Narrow escape from death Life in a slave prison I prepared myself for the journey before named and started back in the month of July My intention was to let no person know my business until I returned back to the North I went to Cincinnati and got a passage down on board of a boat just as I did the first time without any misfortune or delay I called on my mother and the raising of a dead body from the grave could not have been more surprising to any one than my arrival was to her on that sad summer's night She was not able to suppress her feelings When I entered the room there was but one other person in the house with my mother and this was a little slave girl who was asleep when I entered The impulsive feeling which is ever ready to act itself out at the return of a long absent friend was more than my bereaved mother could suppress And unfortunately for me the loud shouts of joy at that late hour of the night awakened the little slave girl who afterwards betrayed me She kept perfectly still and never let either of us know that she was awake in order that she might hear our conversation and report it Mother informed me where my family was living and that she would see them the next day and would make arrangements for us to meet the next night at that house after the people in the village had gone to bed I then went off and concealed myself during the next day and according to promise came back the next night about eleven o'clock When I got near the house moving very cautiously filled with fearful apprehensions I saw several men walking around the house as if they were looking for some person I went back and waited about one hour before I returned and the number of men had increased They were still to be seen lurking about this house with dogs following them This strange movement frightened me off again and I never returned until after midnight at which time I slipped up to the window and rapped for my mother who sprang to it and informed me that I was betrayed by the girl who overheard our conversation the night before She thought that if I could keep out of the way for a few days the white people would think that this girl was mistaken or had lied She had told her old mistress that I was there that night and had made a plot with my mother to get my wife and child there the next night and that I was going to take them off to Canada I went off to a friend of mine who rendered me all the aid that one slave could render another under the circumstances Thank God he is now free from slavery and is doing well He was a messenger for me to my wife and mother until at the suggestion of my mother I changed an old friend for a new one who betrayed me for the sum of five dollars We had set the time when we were to start for Canada which was to be on the next Saturday night My mother had an old friend whom she thought was true and she got him to conceal me in a barn not over two miles from the village This man brought provisions to me sent by my mother and would tell me the news which was in circulation about me among the citizens But the poor fellow was not able to withstand the temptation of money My owners had about given me up and thought report of the slave girl was false but they had offered a little reward among the slaves for my apprehension The night before I was betrayed I met with my mother and wife and we had set up nearly all night plotting to start on the next Saturday night I hid myself away in the flax in the barn and being much rest broken I slept until the next morning about o'clock Then I was awakened by a mob of blood thirsty slaveholders who had come armed with all the implements of death with a determination to reduce me again to a life of slavery or murder me on the spot When I looked up and saw that I was surrounded they were exclaiming at the top of their voices shoot him down shoot him down If he offers to run or to resist kill him I saw it was no use then for me to make any resistance as I should be murdered I felt confident that I had been betrayed by a slave and all my flattering prospects of rescuing my family were gone for ever and the grim monster slavery with all its horrors was staring me in the face I surrendered myself to this hostile mob at once The first thing done after they had laid violent hands on me was to bind my hands behind me with a cord and rob me of all I possessed In searching my pockets they found my certificate from the Methodist E Church which had been given me by my classleader testifying to my worthiness as a member of that church And what made the matter look more disgraceful to me many of this mob were members of the M E Church and they were the persons who took away my church ticket and then robbed me also of fourteen dollars in cash a silver watch for which I paid ten dollars a pocket knife for which I paid seventy five cents and a Bible for which I paid sixty two and one half cents All this they tyrannically robbed me of and yet my owner Wm Gatewood was a regular member of the same church to which I belonged He then had me taken to a blacksmith's shop and most wickedly had my limbs bound with heavy irons and then had my body locked within the cold dungeon walls of the Bedford jail to be sold to a Southern slave trader My heart was filled with grief my eyes were filled with tears I could see no way of escape I could hear no voice of consolation Slaveholders were coming to the dungeon window in great numbers to ask me questions Some were rejoicing some swearing and others saying that I ought to be hung while others were in favor of sending both me and my wife to New Orleans They supposed that I had informed her all about the facilities for slaves to escape to Canada and that she would tell other slaves after I was gone hence we must all be sent off to where we could neither escape ourselves nor instruct others the way In the afternoon of the same day Malinda was permitted to visit the prison wherein I was locked but was not permitted to enter the door When she looked through the dungeon grates and saw my sad situation which was caused by my repeated adventures to rescue her and my little daughter from the grasp of slavery it was more than she could bear without bursting in tears She plead for admission into the cold dungeon where I was confined but without success With manacled limbs with wounded spirit with sympathising tears and with bleeding heart I intreated Malinda to weep not for me for it only added to my grief which was greater than I could bear I have often suffered from the sting of the cruel slave driver's lash on my quivering flesh I have suffered from corporeal punishment in its various forms I have mingled my sorrows with those that were bereaved by the ungodly soul drivers and I also know what it is to shed the sympathetic tear at the grave of a departed friend but all this is but a mere trifle compared with my sufferings from then to the end of six months subsequent The second night while I was in jail two slaves came to the dungeon grates about the dead hour of night and called me to the grates to have some conversation about Canada and the facilities for getting there They knew that I had travelled over the road and they were determined to run away and go where they could be free I of course took great pleasure in giving them directions how and where to go and they started in less than a week from that time and got clear to Canada I have seen them both since I came back to the north myself They were known by the names of King and Jack The third day I was brought out of the prison to be carried off with my little family to the Louisville slave market My hands were fastened together with heavy irons and two men to guard me with loaded rifles one of whom led the horse upon which I rode My wife and child were set upon another nag After we were all ready to start my old master thought I was not quite safe enough and ordered one of the boys to bring him a bed cord from the store He then tied my feet together under the horse declaring that if I flew off this time I should fly off with the horse Many tears were shed on that occasion by our friends and relatives who saw us dragged off in irons to be sold in the human flesh market No tongue could express the deep anguish of my soul when I saw the silent tear drops streaming down the sable cheeks of an aged slave mother at my departure and that too caused by a black hearted traitor who was himself a slave I love the man with a feeling soul Whose passions are deep and strong Whose cords when touched with a kindred power Will vibrate loud and long The man whose word is bond and law Who ne'er for gold or power Would kiss the hand that would stab the heart In adversity's trying hour I love the man who delights to help The panting struggling poor The man that will open his heart Nor close against the fugitive at his door Oh give me a heart that will firmly stand When the storm of affliction shall lower A hand that will never shrink if grasped In misfortune's darkest hour As we approached the city of Louisville we attracted much attention my being tied and handcuffed and a person leading the horse upon which I rode The horse appeared to be much frightened at the appearance of things in the city being young and skittish A carriage passing by jammed against the nag which caused him to break from the man who was leading him and in his fright throw me off backwards My hands being confined with irons and my feet tied under the horse with a rope I had no power to help myself I fell back off of the horse and could not extricate myself from this dreadful condition the horse kicked with all his might while I was tied so close to his rump that he could only strike me with his legs by kicking The breath was kicked out of my body but my bones were not broken No one who saw my situation would have given five dollars for me It was thought by all that I was dead and would never come to life again When the horse was caught the cords were cut from my limbs and I was rubbed with whiskey camphor c which brought me to life again Many bystanders expressed sympathy for me in my deplorable condition and contempt for the tyrant who tied me to the young horse I was then driven through the streets of the city with my little family on foot to jail wherein I was locked with handcuffs yet on A physician was then sent for who doctored me several days before I was well enough to be sold in market The jail was one of the most disagreeable places I ever was confined in It was not only disagreeable on account of the filth and dirt of the most disagreeable kind but there were bed bugs fleas lice and musquitoes in abundance to contend with At night we had to lie down on the floor in this filth Our food was very scanty and of the most inferior quality No gentleman's dog would eat what we were compelled to eat or starve I had not been in this prison many days before Madison Garrison the soul driver bought me and my family to sell again in the New Orleans slave market He was buying up slaves to take to New Orleans So he took me and my little family to the work house to be kept under lock and key at work until he had bought up as many as he wished to take off to the South The work house of Louisville was a very large brick building built on the plan of a jail or State's prison with many apartments to it divided off into cells wherein prisoners were locked up after night The upper apartments were occupied by females principally This prison was enclosed by a high stone wall upon which stood watchmen with loaded guns to guard the prisoners from breaking out and on either side there were large iron gates When Garrison conducted me with my family to the prison in which we were to be confined until he was ready to take us to New Orleans I was shocked at the horrid sight of the prisoners on entering the yard When the large iron gate or door was thrown open to receive us it was astonishing to see so many whites as well as colored men loaded down with irons at hard labor under the supervision of overseers Some were sawing stone some cutting stone and others breaking stone The first impression which was made on my mind when I entered this place of punishment made me think of hell with all its terrors of torment such as weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth which was then the idea that I had of the infernal regions from oral instruction And I doubt whether there can be a better picture of it drawn than may be sketched from an American slave prison In this prison almost every prisoner had a heavy log chain riveted about his leg It would indeed be astonishing to a christian man to stand in that prison one half hour and hear and see the contaminating influence of Southern slavery on the body and mind of man you may there find almost every variety of character to look on Some signing some crying some praying and others swearing The people of color who were in there were slaves there without crime but for safe keeping while the whites were some of the most abandoned characters living The keeper took me up to the anvil block and fastened a chain about my leg which I had to drag after me both day and night during three months My labor was sawing stone my food was coarse corn bread and beef shanks and cows heads with pot liquor and a very scanty allowance of that I have often seen the meat spoiled when brought to us covered with flies and fly blows and even worms crawling over it when we were compelled to eat it or go without any at all It was all spread out on a long table in separate plates and at the sound of a bell every one would take his plate asking no questions After hastily eating we were hurried back to our work each man dragging a heavy log chain after him to his work About a half hour before night they were commanded to stop work take a bite to eat and then be locked up in a small cell until the next morning after sunrise The prisoners were locked in two together My bed was a cold stone floor with but little bedding My visitors were bed bugs and musquitoes VIII Character of my prison companions Jail breaking contemplated Defeat of our plan My wife and child removed Disgraceful proposal to her and cruel punishment Our departure in a coffle for New Orleans Events of our journey Most of the inmates of this prison I have described were white men who had been sentenced there by the law for depredations committed by them There was in that prison gamblers drunkards thieves robbers adulterers and even murderers There were also in the female department harlots pick pockets and adulteresses In such company and under such influences where there was constant swearing lying cheating and stealing it was impossible for a virtuous person to avoid pollution or to maintain their virtue No place or places in this country can be better calculated to inculcate vice of every kind than a Southern work house or house of correction After a profligate thief or a robber has learned all that they can out of the prison they might go in one of those prisons and learn something more they might properly be called robber colleges and if slaveholders understood this they would never let their slaves enter them No man would give much for a slave who had been kept long in one of these prisons I have often heard them telling each other how they robbed houses and persons on the high way by knocking them down and would rob them pick their pockets and leave them half dead Others would tell of stealing horses cattle sheep and slaves and when they would be sometimes apprehended by the aid of their friends they would break jail But they could most generally find enough to swear them clear of any kind of villany They seemed to take great delight in telling of their exploits in robbery There was a regular combination of them who had determined to resist law wherever they went to carry out their purposes In conversing with myself they learned that I was notorious for running away and professed sympathy for me They thought that I might yet get to Canada and be free and suggested a plan by which I might accomplish it and one way was to learn to read and write so that I might write myself a pass ticket to go just where I pleased when I was taken out of the prison and they taught me secretly all they could while in the prison But there was another plan which they suggested to me to get away from slavery that was to break out of the prison and leave my family I consented to engage in this plot but not to leave my family By my conduct in the prison after having been there several weeks I had gained the confidence of the keeper and the turnkey So much so that when I wanted water or anything of the kind they would open my door and hand it in to me One of the turnkeys was an old colored man who swept and cleaned up the cells supplied the prisoners with water c On Sundays in the afternoon the watchmen of the prison were most generally off and this old slave whose name was Stephen had the prisoners to attend to The white prisoners formed a plot to break out on Sunday in the afternoon by making me the agent to get the prison keys from old Stephen I was to prepare a stone that would weigh about one pound tie it up in a rag and keep it in my pocket to strike pool old Stephen with when he should open my cell door But this I would not consent to do without he should undertake to betray me I gave old Stephen one shilling to buy me a water melon which he was to bring to me in the afternoon All the prisoners were to be ready to strike just as soon as I opened their doors When Stephen opened my door to hand me the melon I was to grasp him by the collar raise the stone over his head and say to him that if he made any alarm that I should knock him down with the stone But if he would be quiet he should not be hurt I was then to take all the keys from him and lock him up in the cell take a chisel and cut the chain from my own leg then unlock all the cells below and let out the other prisoners who were all to cut off their chains We were then to go and let out old Stephen and make him go off with us We were to form a line and march to the front gate of the prison with a sledge hammer and break it open and if we should be discovered and there should be any out cry we were all to run and raise the alarm of fire so as to avoid detection But while we were all listening for Stephen to open the door with the melon he came and reported that he could not got one and handed me back the money through the window All were disappointed and nothing done I looked upon it as being a fortunate thing for me for it was certainly a very dangerous experiment for a slave and they could never get me to consent to be the leader in that matter again A few days after another plot was concocted to to break prison but it was betrayed by one of the party which resulted in the most cruel punishment to the prisoners concerned in it and I felt thankful that my name was not connected with it They were not only flogged but they were kept on bread and water alone for many days A few days after we were put in this prison Garrison came and took my wife and child out I knew not for what purpose nor to what place but after the absence of several days I supposed that he had sold them But one morning the outside door was thrown open and Malinda thrust in by the ruthless hand of Garrison whose voice was pouring forth the most bitter oaths and abusive language that could be dealt out to a female while her heart rending shrieks and sobbing was truly melting to the soul of a father and husband The language of Malinda was Oh my dear little child is gone What shall I do my child is gone This most distressing sound struck a sympathetic chord through all the prison among the prisoners I was not permitted to go to my wife and inquire what had become of little Frances I never expected to see her again for I supposed that she was sold That night however I had a short interview with my much abused wife who told me the secret She said that Garrison had taken her to a private house where he kept female slaves for the basest purposes It was a resort for slave trading profligates and soul drivers who were interested in the same business Soon I after she arrived at this place Garrison gave her to understand what he brought her there for and made a most disgraceful assault on her virtue which she promptly repeled and for which Garrison punished her with the lash threatening her that if she did not submit that he would sell her child The next day he made the same attempt which she resisted declaring that she would not submit to it and again he tied her up and flogged her until her garments were stained with blood He then sent our child off to another part of the city and said he meant to sell it and that she should never see it again He then drove Malinda before him to the work house swearing by his Maker that submit to him or die I have already described her entrance in the prison Two days after this he came again and took Malinda out of the prison It was several weeks before I saw her again and learned that he had not sold her or the child At the same time he was buying up other slaves to take to New Orleans At the expiration of three months he was ready to start with us for the New Orleans slave market but we never knew when we were to go until the hour had arrived for our departure One Sabbath morning Garrison entered the prison and commanded that our limbs should be made ready for the coffles They called us up to an anvil block and the heavy log chains which we had been wearing on our legs during three months were cut off I had been in the prison over three months but he had other slaves who had not been there so long The hand cuffs were then put on to our wrists We were coupled together two and two the right hand of one to the left hand of another and a long chain to connect us together The other prisoners appeared to be sorry to see us start off in this way We marched off to the river Ohio to take passage on board of the steam boat Water Witch But this was at a very low time of water in the fall of The boat got aground and did not get off that night and Garrison had to watch us all night to keep any from getting away He also had a very large savage dog which was trained up to catch runaway slaves We were more than six weeks getting to the city of New Orleans in consequence of low water We were shifted on to several boats before we arrived at the mouth of the river Ohio But we got but very little rest at night As all were chained together night and day it was impossible to sleep being annoyed by the bustle and crowd of the passengers on board by the terrible thought that we were destined to be sold in market as sheep or oxen and annoyed by the galling chains that cramped our wearied limbs on the tedious voyage But I had several opportunities to have run away from Garrison before we got to the mouth of the Ohio river While they were shifting us from one boat to another my hands were some times loosed until they got us all on board and I know that I should have broke away had it not been for the sake of my wife and child who was with me I could see no chance to get them off and I could not leave them in that condition and Garrison was not so much afraid of my running away from him while he held on to my family for he knew from the great sacrifices which I had made to rescue them from slavery that my attachment was too strong to run off and leave them in his hands while there was the least hope of ever getting them away with me Illustration Illustration IX Our arrival and examination at Vicksburg An account of slave sales Cruel punishment with the paddle Attempts to sell myself by Garrison's direction Amusing interview with a slave buyer Deacon Whitfield's examination He purchases the family Character of the Deacon WHEN we arrived at the city of Vicksburg he intended to sell a portion of his slaves there and stopped for three weeks trying to sell But he met with very poor success We had there to pass through an examination or inspection by a city officer whose business it was to inspect slave property that was brought to that Market for sale He examined our backs to see if we had been much scarred by the lash He examined our limbs to see whether we were inferior As it is hard to tell the ages of slaves they look in their mouths at their teeth and prick up the skin on the back of their hands and if the person is very far advanced in life when the skin is pricked up the pucker will stand so many seconds on the back of the hand But the most rigorous examinations of slaves by those slave inspectors is on the mental capacity If they are found to be very intelligent this is pronounced the most objectionable of all other qualities connected with the life of a slave In fact it undermines the whole fabric of his chattelhood it prepares for what slaveholders are pleased to pronounce the unpardonable sin when committed by a slave It lays the foundation for running away and going to Canada They also see in it a love for freedom patriotism insurrection bloodshed and exterminating war against American slavery Hence they are very careful to inquire whether a slave who is for sale can read or write This question has been asked me often by slave traders and cotton planters while I was there for market After conversing with me they have sworn by their Maker that they would not have me among their negroes and that they saw the devil in my eye I would run away c I have frequently been asked also if I had ever answer run away but Garrison would generally this question for me in the negative He could have sold my little family without any trouble for the sum of one thousand dollars But for fear he might not get me off at so great an advantage as the people did not like my appearance he could do better by selling us all together They all wanted my wife while but very few wanted me He asked twenty five hundred dollars but was not able to get us off at that price He tried to speculate on my Christian character He tried to make it appear that I was so pious and honest that I would not runaway for ill treatment which was a gross mistake for I never had religion enough to keep me from running away from slavery in my life But we were taken from Vicksburgh to the city of New Orleans were we were to be sold at any rate We were taken to a trader's yard or a slave prison on the corner of' St Joseph street This was a common resort for slave traders and planters who wanted to buy slaves and all classes of slaves were kept there for sale to be sold in private or public young or old males or females children or parents husbands or wives Everyday at o'clock they were exposed for sale They had to be in trim for showing themselves to the public for sale Every one's head had to be combed and their faces washed and those who were inclined to look dark and rough were compelled to wash in greasy dish water to look slick and lively When spectators would come in the yard the slaves were ordered out to form a line They were made to stand up straight and look as sprightly as they could and when they were asked a question they had to answer it as promptly as they could and try to induce the spectators to buy them If they failed to do this they were severely paddled after the spectators were gone The object for using the paddle in the place of a lash was to conceal the marks which would be made by the flogging And the object for flogging under such circumstances is to make the slaves anxious to be sold The paddle is made of a piece of hickory timber about one inch thick three inches in width and about eighteen inches in length The part is applied to the flesh is bored full of quarter inch Illustration Illustration auger holes and every time this is applied to the flesh of the victim the blood gushes through the holes of the paddle or a blister makes its appearance The persons who are thus flogged are always stripped naked and their hands tied together They are then bent over double their knees are forced between their elbows and a stick is put through between the elbows and the bend of the legs in order to hold the victim in that position while the paddle is applied to those parts of the body which would not be so likely to be seen by those who wanted to buy slaves See on I was kept in this prison for several months and no one would buy me for fear I would run away One day while I was in this prison Garrison got mad with my wife and took her off in one of the rooms with his paddle in hand swearing that he would paddle her and I could afford her no protection at all while the strong arm of the law public opinion and custom were all against me I have often heard Garrison say that he had rather paddle a female than eat when he was hungry that it was music for him to hear them scream and too see their blood run After the lapse of several months he found that he could not dispose of my person to a good advantage while he kept me in that prison confined among the other slaves I do not speak with vanity when I say the contrast was so great between myself and ordinary slaves from the fact that I had enjoyed superior advantages to which I have already referred They have their slaves classed off and numbered Garrison came to me one day and informed me that I might go out through the city and find myself a master I was to go to the Hotels boarding houses c tell them that my wife was a good cook wash woman c and that I was a good dining room servant carriage driver or porter and in this way I might find some gentleman who would buy us both and that this was the only hope of our being sold together But before starting me out he dressed me up in a suit of his old clothes so as to make me look respectable and I was so much better dressed than usual that I felt quite gay He would not allow my wife to go out with me however for fear we might get away I was out every day for several weeks three or four hours in each day trying to find a new master but without success Many of the old French inhabitants have taken slaves for their wives in this city and their own children for their servants Such commonly are called Creoles They are better treated than other slaves and I resembled this class in appearance so much that the French did not want me Many of them set their mulatto children free and make slaveholders of them At length one day I heard that there was a gentleman in the city from the State of Tennessee to buy slaves He had brought down two rafts of lumber for market and I thought if I could get him buy me with my family and take us to Tennessee from there I would stand a better opportunity to run away again and get to Canada than I would from the extreme South So I brushed up myself and walked down to the river's bank where the man was pointed out to me standing on board of his raft I approached him and after passing the usual compliments I said Sir I understand that you wish to purchase a lot of servants and I have called to know if it is so He smiled and appeared to be much pleased at my visit on such laudable business supposing me to be a slave trader He commenced rubbing his hands together and replied by saying Yes sir I am glad to see you It is a part of my business here to buy slaves and if I could get you to take my lumber in part pay I should like to buy four or five of your slaves at any rate What kind of slaves have you sir After I found that he took me to be a slave trader I knew that it would be of no use for me to tell him that I was myself a slave looking for a master for he would have doubtless brought up the same objection that others had brought up that I was too white and that they were afraid that I could read and write and would never serve as a slave but run away My reply to the question respecting the quality of my slaves was that I did not think his lumber would suit me that I must have the cash for my negroes and turned on my heel and left him I returned to the prison and informed my wife of the fact that I had been taken to be a slaveholder She thought that in addition to my light complexion my being dressed up in Garrison's old slave trading clothes might have caused the man to think that I was a slave trader and she was afraid that we should yet be separated if I should not succeed in finding some body to buy us Every day to us was a day of trouble and every night brought new and fearful apprehensions that the golden link which binds together husband and wife might be broken by the heartless tyrant before the light of another day Deep has been the anguish of my soul when looking over my little family during the silent hours of the night knowing the great danger of our being sold off at auction the next day and parted forever That this might not come to pass many have been the tears and prayers which I have offered up to the God of Israel that we might be preserved While waiting here to be disposed of I heard of one Francis Whitfield a cotton planter who wanted to buy slaves He was represented to be a very pious soul being a deacon of a Baptist church As the regulations as well as public opinion generally were against slaves meeting for religious worship I thought it would give me a better opportunity to attend to my religious duties should I fall into the hands of this deacon So I called on him and tried to show to the best advantage for the purpose of inducing him to buy me and my family When I approached him I felt much pleased at his external appearance I addressed him in the following words as well as I can remember Sir I understand you are desirous of purchasing slaves With a very pleasant smile he replied Yes I do want to buy some are you for sale Yes sir with my wife and one child Garrison had given me a note to show wherever I went that I was for sale speaking of my wife and child giving us a very good character of course and I handed him the note After reading it over he remarked I have a few questions to ask you and if you will tell me the truth like a good boy perhaps I may buy you with your family In the first place my boy you are a little too near white I want you to tell me now whether you can read or write My reply was in the negative Now I want you to tell we whether you have run away Don't tell me no stories now like a good fellow and perhaps I may buy you But as I was not under oath to tell him the whole truth I only gave him a part of it by telling him that I had run away once He appeared to be pleased at that but cautioned me to tell him the truth and asked me how long I stayed away when I run off I told him that I was gone a month He assented to this by a bow of his head and making a long grunt saying That's right tell me the truth like a good boy The whole truth was that I had been off in the state of Ohio and other free states and even to Canada besides this I was notorious for running away from my boyhood I never told him that I had been a runaway longer than one month neither did I tell him that I had not run away more than once in my life for these questions he never asked me I afterwards found him to be one of the basest hypocrites that I ever saw He looked like a saint talked like the best of slave holding Christians and acted at home like the devil When he saw my wife and child he concluded to buy us He paid for me twelve hundred dollars and one thousand for my wife and child He also bought several other slaves at the same time and took home with him His residence was in the parish of Claiborn fifty miles up from the mouth of Red River When we arrived there we found his slaves poor ragged stupid and half starved The food he allowed them per week was one peck of corn for each grown person one pound of pork and sometimes a molasses This was all that they were allowed and if they got more they stole it He had one of the most cruel overseers to be found in that section of country He weighed and measured out to them their week's allowance of food very Sabbath morning The overseer's horn was sounded two hours before daylight for them in the morning in order that they should be ready for work before daylight They were worked from daylight until after dark without stopping but one half hour to eat or rest which was at noon And at the busy season of the year they were compelled to work just as hard on the Sabbath as on any other day Illustration X Cruel treatment on Whitfield's farm Exposure of the Children Mode of extorting extra labor Neglect of the sick Strange medicine used Death of our second child My first impressions when I arrived on the Deacon's farm were that he was far more like what the people call the devil than he was like a deacon Not many days after my arrival there I heard the Deacon tell one of the slave girls that he had bought her for a wife for his boy Stephen which office he compelled her fully to perform against her will This he enforced by a threat At first the poor girl neglected to do this having no sort of affection for the man but she was finally forced to it by an application of the driver's lash as threatened by the Deacon The next thing I observed was that he made the slave driver strip his own wife and flog her for not doing just as her master had ordered He had a white overseer and a colored man for a driver whose business it was to watch and drive the slaves in the field and do the flogging according orders of the overseer Next a mulatto girl who waited about the house on her mistress displeased her for which the Deacon stripped and tied her up He then handed the lash and ordered me to put it on but I told him I never had done the like and hoped he would not compel me to do it He then informed me that I was to be his overseer and that he had bought me for that purpose He was paying a man eight hundred dollars a year to oversee and he believed I was competent to do the same business and if I would do it up right he would put nothing harder on me to do and if I knew not how to flog a slave he would set me an example by which I might be governed He then commenced on this poor girl and gave her two hundred lashes before he had her untied Illustration Illustration After giving her fifty lashes he stopped and lectured her awhile asking her if she thought that she could obey her mistress c She promised to do all in her power to please him and her mistress if he would have mercy on her But this plea was all vain He commenced on her again and this flogging was carried on in the most inhuman manner until she had received two hundred stripes on her naked quivering flesh tied up and exposed to the public gaze of all And this was the example that I was to copy after He then compelled me to wash her back off with strong salt brine before she was untied which was so revolting to my feelings that I could not refrain from shedding tears For some cause he never called on me again to flog a slave I presume he saw that I was not savage enough The above were about the first items of the Deacon's conduct which struck me with peculiar disgust After having enjoyed the blessings of civil and religious liberty for a season to be dragged into that horrible place with my family to linger out my existence without the aid of religious societies or the light of revelation was more than I could endure I really felt as if I had got into one of the darkest corners of the earth I thought I was almost out of humanity's reach and should never again have the pleasure of hearing the gospel sound as I could see no way by which I could extricate myself yet I never omitted to pray for deliverance I had faith to believe that the Lord could see our wrongs and hear our cries I was not used quite as bad as the regular field hands as the greater part of my time was spent working about the house and my wife was the cook This country was full of pine timber and every slave had to prepare a light wood torch over night made of pine knots to meet the overseer with before daylight in the morning Each person had to have his torch lit and come with it in his hand to the gin house before the overseer and driver so as to be ready to go to the cotton field by the time they could see to pick out cotton These lights looked beautiful at a distance The object of blowing the horn for them two hours before day was that they should get their bite to eat before they went to the field that they need not stop to eat but once during the day Another object was to do up their flogging which had been omitted over night I have often heard the sound of the slave driver's lash on the backs of the slaves and their heart rending shrieks which were enough to melt the heart of humanity even among the most barbarous nations of the earth But the Deacon would keep no overseer on his plantation who neglected to perform this every morning I have heard him say that he was no better pleased than when he could hear the overseer's loud complaining voice long before daylight in the morning and the sound of the driver's lash among the toiling slaves Illustration Oh my child my child This was a very warm climate abounding with musquitoes galinippers and other insects which were exceedingly annoying to the poor slaves by night and day at their quarters and in the field But more especially to their helpless little children which they had to carry with them to the cotton fields where they had to set on the damp ground alone from morning till night exposed to the scorching rays of the sun liable to be bitten by poisonous rattle snakes which are plenty in that section of the country or to be devoured by large alligators which are often seen creeping through the cotton fields going from swamp to swamp seeking their prey The cotton planters generally never allow a slave mother time to go to the house or quarter during the day to nurse her child hence they have to carry them to the cotton fields and tie them in the shade of a tree or in clusters of high weeds about in the fields where they can go to them at noon when they are allowed to stop work for one half hour This is the reason why so very few slave children are raised on these cotton plantations mothers have no time to take care of them and they are often found dead in the field and in the quarter for want of the care of their mothers But I never was eye witness to a case of this kind but have heard many narrated by my slave brothers and sisters some of which occurred on the deacon's plantation Their plan of getting quantities of cotton picked is not only to extort it from them by the lash but hold out an inducement and deceive them by giving small prizes For example the overseer will offer something worth one or two dollars to any slave who will pick out the most cotton in one day dividing the hands off in three classes and offering a prize to the one who will pick out the most cotton in each of the classes By this means they are all interested in trying to get the prize After making them try it over several times and weighing what cotton they pick every night the overseer can tell just how much every hand can pick He then gives the present to those that pick the most cotton and then if they do not pick just as much afterward they are flogged I have known the slaves to be so much fatigued from labor that they could scarcely get to their lodging places from the field at night And then they would have to prepare something to eat before they could lie down to rest Their corn they had to grind on a hand mill for bread stuff or pound it in a mortar and by the time they would get their suppers it would be midnight then they would herd down all together and take but two or three hours rest before the overseer's horn called them up again to prepare for the field At the time of sickness among slaves they had but very little attention The master was to be the judge of their sickness but never had studied the medical profession He always pronounced a slave who said he was sick a liar and a hypocrite said there was nothing the matter and he only wanted to keep from work His remedy was most generally strong red pepper tea boiled till it was red He would make them drink a pint cup full of it at one dose If he should not get better very soon after it the dose was repeated If that should not accomplish the object for which it was given or have the desired effect a pot or kettle was then put over the fire with a large quantity of chimney soot which was boiled down until it was as strong as the juice of tobacco and the poor sick slave was compelled to drink a quart of it This would operate on the system like salts or castor oil But if the slave should not be very ill he would rather work as long as he could stand up than to take this dreadful medicine If it should be a very valuable slave sometimes a physician was sent for and something done to save him But no special aid is afforded the suffering slave even in the last trying hour when he is called to grapple with the grim monster death He has no Bible no family altar no minister to address to him the consolations of the gospel before he launches into the spirit world As to the burial of slaves but very little more care is taken of their dead bodies than if they were dumb beasts My wife was very sick while we were both living with the Deacon We expected every day would be her last While she was sick we lost our second child and I was compelled to dig my own child's grave and bury it myself without even a box to put it in XI I attend a prayer meeting Punishment therefor threatened I attempt to escape alone My return to take my family Our sufferings Dreadful attack of wolves Our recapture SOME months after Malinda had recovered from her sickness I got permission from the Deacon on one Sabbath day to attend a prayer meeting on a neighboring plantation with a few old superanuated slaves although this was contrary to the custom of the country for slaves were not allowed to assemble for religious worship Being more numerous than the whites there was fear of rebellion and the overpowering of their oppressors in order to obtain freedom But this gentleman on whose plantation I attended the meeting was not a Deacon nor a professor of religion He was not afraid of a few old Christian slaves rising up to kill their master because he allowed them to worship God on the Sabbath day We had a very good meeting although our exercises were not conducted in accordance with an enlightened Christianity for we had no Bible no intelligent leader but a conscience prompted by our own reason constrained us to worship God the Creator of all things When I returned home from meeting I told the other slaves what a good time we had at our meeting and requested them to go with me to meeting thereon the next Sabbath As no slave was allowed to go from the plantation on a visit without a written pass from his master on the next Sabbath several of us went to the Deacon to get permission to attend that prayer meeting but he refused to let any go I thought I would slip off and attend the meeting and get back before he would miss me and would not know that I had been to the meeting When I returned home from the meeting as I approached the house I saw Malinda standing out at the fence looking in the direction in which I was expected to return She hailed my approach not with joy but with grief She was weeping under great distress of mind but it was hard for me to extort from her the reason why she wept She finally in formed me that her master had found out that I had violated his law and I should suffer the penalty which was five hundred lashes on my naked back I asked her how he knew that I had gone She said I had not long been gone before he called for me and I was not to be found He then sent the overseer on horseback to the place where we were to meet to see if I was there But when the overseer got to the place the meeting was over and I had gone back home but had gone a nearer route through the woods and the overseer happened not to meet me He heard that I had been there and hurried back home before me and told the Deacon who ordered him to take me on the next morning strip off my clothes drive down four stakes in the ground and fasten my limbs to them then strike me five hundred lashes for going to the prayer meeting This was what distressed my poor companion She thought it was more than I could bear and that it would be the death of me I concluded then to run away but she thought they would catch me with the blood hounds by their taking my track But to avoid them I thought I would ride off on one of the Deacon's mules She thought if I did they would sell me No matter I will try it said I let the consequences be what they may The matter can be no worse than it now is So I tackled up the Deacon's best mule with his saddle c and started that night and went off eight or ten miles from home But I found the mule to be rather troublesome and was like to betray me by braying especially when he would see cattle horses or any thing of the kind in the woods The second night from home I camped in a cane break down in the Red river swamp not a great way off from the road perhaps not twenty rods exposed to wild ferocious beasts which were numerous in that section of country On that night about the middle of the night the mule heard the sound of horses feet on the road and he commenced stamping and trying to break away As the horses seemed to come nearer the mule commenced trying to bray and it was all that I could do to prevent him from making a loud bray there in the woods which would have betrayed me I supposed that it was the overseer out with the dogs looking for me and I found afterwards that I was not mistaken As soon as the people had passed by I mounted the mule and took him home to prevent his betraying me When I got near by home I stripped off the tackling and turned the mule loose I then slipt up to the cabin wherein my wife laid and found her awake much distressed about me She informed me that they were then out looking for me and that the Deacon was bent on flogging me nearly to death and then selling me off from my family This was truly heart rending to my poor wife the thought of our being torn apart in a strange land after having been sold away from all her friends and relations was more than she could bear The Deacon had declared that I should not only suffer for the crime of attending a prayer meeting without his permission and for running away but for the awful crime of stealing a jackass which was death by the law when committed by a negro But I well knew that I was regarded as property and so was the ass and I thought if one piece of property took off another there could be no law violated in the act no more sin committed in this than if one jackass had rode off another But after consultation with my wife I concluded to take her and my little daughter with me and they would be guilty of the same crime that I was so far as running away was concerned and if the Deacon sold one he might sell us all and perhaps to the same person So we started off with our child that night and made our way down to the Red river swamps among the buzzing insects and wild beasts of the forest We wandered about in the wilderness for eight or ten days before we were apprehended striving to make our way from slavery but it was all in vain Our food was parched corn with wild fruit such as pawpaws percimmons grapes c We did at one time chance to find a sweet potato patch where we got a few potatoes but most of the time while we were out we were lost We wanted to cross the Red river but could find no conveyance to cross in I recollect one day of finding a crooked tree which bent over the river or over one fork of the river where it was divided by an island I should think that the tree was at least twenty feet from the surface of the water I picked up my little child and my wife followed me saying if we perish let us all perish together in the stream We succeeded in crossing over I often look back to that dangerous event even now with astonishment and wonder how I could have run such a risk What would induce me to run the same risk now What could induce me now to leave home and friends and go to the wild forest and lay out on the cold ground night after night without covering and live on parched corn What would induce me to take my family and go into the Red river swamps of Louisiana among the snakes and alligators with all the liabilities of being destroyed by them hunted down with blood hounds or lay myself liable to be shot down like the wild beasts of the forest Nothing I say nothing but the strongest love of liberty humanity and justice to myself and family would induce me to run such a risk again When we crossed over on the tree we supposed that we had crossed over the main body of the river but we had not proceeded far on our journey before we found that we were on an Island surrounded by water on either side We made our bed that night in a pile of dry leaves which had fallen from off the trees We were much rest broken wearied from hunger and travelling through briers swamps and cane brakes consequently we soon fell asleep after lying down About the dead hour of the night I was aroused by the awful howling of a gang of blood thirsty wolves which had found us out and surrounded us as their prey there in the dark wilderness many miles from any house or settlement My dear little child was so dreadfully alarmed that she screamed loudly with fear my wife trembling like a leaf on a tree at the thought of being devoured there in the wilderness by ferocious wolves The wolves kept howling and were near enough for us to see their glaring eyes and hear their chattering teeth I then thought that the hour of death for us was at hand that we should not live to see the light of another day for there was no way for our escape My little family were looking up to me for protection but I could afford them none And while I was offering up my prayers to that God who never forsakes those in the hour of Illustration danger who trust in him I thought of Deacon Whitfield I thought of his profession and doubted his piety I thought of his hand cuffs of his whips of his chains of his stocks of his thumb screws of his slave driver and overseer and of his religion I also thought of his opposition to prayer meetings and of his five hundred lashes promised me for attending a prayer meeting I thought of God thought of the devil I thought of hell and I thought of heaven and wondered whether I should ever see the Deacon there And I calculated that if heaven was made up of such Deacons or such persons it could not be filled with love to all mankind and with glory and eternal happiness as we know it is from the truth of the Bible The reader may perhaps think me tedious on this topic but indeed it is one of so much interest to me that I find myself entirely unable to describe what my own feelings were at that time I was so much excited by the fierce howling of the savage wolves and the frightful screams of my little family that I thought of the future I thought of the past I thought the time of my departure had come at last My impression is that all these thoughts and thousands of others flashed through my mind while I was surrounded by those wolves But it seemed to be the will of a merciful providence that our lives should be spared and that we should not be destroyed by them I had no weapon of defence but a long bowie knife which I had slipped from the Deacon It was a very splendid blade about two feet in length and about two inches in width This used to be a part of his armor of defence while walking about the plantation among his slaves The plan which I took to expel the wolves was a very dangerous one but it proved effectual While they were advancing to me prancing and accumulating in number apparently of all sizes and grades who had come to the feast I thought just at this time that there was no alternative left but for me to make a charge with my bowie knife I well knew from the action of the wolves that if I made no farther resistance they would soon destroy us and if I made a break at them the matter could be no worse I thought if I must die I would die striving to protect my little family from destruction die striving to escape from slavery My wife took a club in one hand and her child in the other while I rushed forth with my bowie knife in hand to fight off the savage wolves I made one desperate charge at them and at the same time making a loud yell at the top of my voice that caused them to retreat and scatter which was equivalent to a victory on our part Our prayers were answered and our lives spared through the night We slept no more that night and the next morning there were no wolves to be seen or heard and we resolved not to stay on that island another night We travelled up and down the river side trying to find a place where we could cross FinalIy we found a lot of drift wood clogged together extending across the stream at a narrow place in the river upon which we crossed over But we had not yet surmounted our greatest difficulty We had to meet one which was far more formidable than the first Not many days after I had to face the Deacon We had been wandering about through the cane brakes bushes and briers for several days when we heard the yelping of blood hounds a great way off but they seemed to come nearer and nearer to us We thought after awhile that they must be on our track we listened attentively at the approach We knew it was no use for us to undertake to escape from them and as they drew nigh we heard the voice of a man hissing on the dogs After awhile we saw the hounds coming in full speed on our track and the soul drivers close after them on horse back yelling like tigers as they came in sight The shrill yelling of the savage blood hounds as they drew nigh made the woods echo The first impulse was to run to escape the approaching danger of ferocious dogs and blood thirsty slave hunters who were so rapidly approaching me with loaded muskets and bowie knives with a determination to kill or capture me and my family I started to run with my little daughter in arms but stumbled and fell down and scratched the arm of little Frances with a brier so that it bled very much but the dear child never cried for she seemed to know the danger to which we were exposed But we soon found that it was no use for us to run The dogs were soon at our heels and we were compelled to stop or be torn to pieces by them Illustration Illustration By this time the soul drivers came charging up on their horses commanding us to stand still or they would shoot us down Of course I surrendered up for the sake of my family The most abusive terms to be found in the English language were poured forth on us with bitter oaths They tied my hands behind me and drove us home before them to suffer the penalty of a slaveholder's broken law As we drew nigh the plantation my heart grew faint I was aware that we should have to suffer almost death for running off I was filled with dreadful apprehensions at the thought of meeting a professed follower of Christ whom I knew to be a hypocrite No tongue no pen can ever describe what my feelings were at that time XII My sad condition before Whitfield My terrible punishment Incidents of a former attempt to escape Jack at a farm house Six pigs and turkey Our surprise and arrest THE reader may perhaps imagine what must have been my feelings when I found myself surrounded on the island with my little family at midnight by a gang of savage wolves This was one of those trying emergencies in my life when there was apparently but one step between us and the grave But I had no cords wrapped about my limbs to prevent my struggling against the impending danger to which I was then exposed I was not denied the consolation of resisting in self defence as was now the case There was no Deacon standing before me with a loaded rifle swearing that I should submit to the torturing lash or be shot down like a dumb beast I felt that my chance was by far better among the howling wolves in the Red river swamp than before Deacon Whitfield on the cotton plantation I was brought before him as a criminal before a bar without counsel to be tried and condemned by a tyrant's law My arms were bound with a cord broken and my little family standing by weeping I was not allowed to plead my own cause and there was no one to utter a word in my behalf He ordered that the field hands should be called together to witness my punishment that it might serve as a caution to them never to attend a prayer meeting or runaway as I had lest they should receive the same punishment At the sound of the overseer's horn all the slaves came forward and witnessed my punishment My clothing was stripped off and I was compelled to lie down on the ground with my face to the earth Four stakes were driven in the ground to which my hands and feet were tied Then the overseer stood over me with the lash and laid it on according to the Deacon's order Fifty lashes were laid on before stopping I was then lectured with reference to my going to prayer meeting without his orders and running away to escape flogging While I suffered under this dreadful torture I prayed and wept and implored mercy at the hand of slavery but found none After I was marked from my neck to my heels the Deacon took the gory lash and said he thought there was a spot on my back yet where he could put in a few more He wanted to give me something to remember him by he said After I was flogged almost to death in this way a paddle was brought forward and eight or ten blows given me with it which was by far worse than the lash My wounds were then washed with salt brine after which I was let up A description of such paddles I have already given in another I Illustration Illustration was so badly punished that I was not able to work for several days After being flogged as described they took me off several miles to a shop and had a heavy iron collar riveted on my neck with prongs extending above my head on the end of which there was a small bell I was not able to reach the bell with my hand This heavy load of iron I was compelled to wear for six weeks I never was allowed to lie in the same house with my family again while I was the slave of Whitfield I either had to sleep with my feet in the stocks or be chained with a large log chain to a log over night with no bed or bedding to rest my wearied limbs on after toiling all day in the cotton field I suffered almost death while kept in this confinement and he had ordered the overseer never to let me loose again saying that I thought of getting free by running off but no negro should ever get away from him alive I have omitted to state that this was the second time I had run away from him while I was gone the first time he extorted from my wife the fact that I had been in the habit of running away before we left Kentucky that I had been to Canada and that I was trying to learn the art of reading and writing All this was against me It is true I was striving to learn myself to write I was a kind of a house servant and was frequently sent off on errands but never without a written pass and on Sundays I have sometimes got permission to visit our neighbor's slaves and I have often tried to write myself a pass Whenever I got hold of an old letter that had been thrown away or a piece of white paper I would save it to write on I have often gone off in the woods and spent the greater part of the day alone trying to learn to write myself a pass by writing on the backs of old letters copying after the pass that had been written by Whitfield by so doing I got the use of the pen and could form letters as well as I can now but knew not what they were The Deacon had an old slave by the name of Jack whom he bought about the time that he bought me Jack was born in the State of Virginia He had some idea of freedom had often run away but was very ignorant knew not where to go for refuge but understood all about providing something to eat when unjustly deprived of it So for ill treatment we concluded to take a tramp together I was to be the pilot while Jack was to carry the baggage and keep us in provisions Before we started I managed to get hold of a suit of clothes the Deacon possessed with his gun ammunition and bowie knife We also procured a blanket a joint of meat and some bread We started in a northern direction being bound for the city of Little Rock State of Arkansas We travelled by night and laid by in the day being guided by the unchangeable North Star but at length our provisions gave out and it was Jack's place to get more We came in sight of a large plantation one morning where we saw people of color and Jack said he could get something there among the slaves that night for us to eat So we concealed ourselves in sight of this plantation until about bed time when we saw the lights extinguished During the day we saw a female slave passing from the dwelling house to the kitchen as if she was the cook the house being about three rods from the landlord's dwelling After we supposed the whites were all asleep Jack slipped up softly to the kitchen to try his luck with the cook to see if he could get any thing from her to eat I would remark that the domestic slaves are often found to be traitors to their own people for the purpose of gaining favor with their masters and they are encouraged and trained up by them to report every plot they know of being formed about stealing any thing or running away or any thing of the kind and for which they are paid This is one of the principal causes of the slaves being divided among themselves and without which they could not be held in bondage one year and perhaps not half that time I now proceed to describe the unsuccessful attempt of poor Jack to obtain something from the female slave to satisfy hunger The planter's house was situated on an elevated spot on the side of a hill The fencing about the house and garden was very crookedly laid up with rails The night was rather dark and rainy and Jack left me with the understanding that I was to stay at a certain place until he returned I cautioned him before he left me to be very careful and after he started I left the place where he was going to find me when he returned for fear something might happen which might lead to my detection should I remain at that spot So I left it and went off where I could see the house and that place too Jack had not long been gone before I heard a great noise a man crying out with a loud voice Catch him Catch him and hissing the dogs on and they were close after Jack The next thing I saw was Jack running for life and an old white man after him with a gun and his dogs The fence being on sidling ground and wet with the rain when Jack run against it he knocked down several pannels of it and fell tumbling over and over to the foot of the hill but soon recovered and ran to where he had left me but I was gone The dogs were still after him There happened to be quite a thicket of small oak shrubs and bushes in the direction he ran I think he might have been heard running and straddling bushes a quarter of a mile The poor fellow hurt himself considerably in straddling over bushes in that way in making his escape Finally the dogs relaxed their chase and poor Jack and myself again met in the thick forest He said when he rapped on the cook house door the colored woman came to the door He asked her if she would let him have a bite of bread if she had it that he was a poor hungry absconding slave But she made no reply to what he said but immediately sounded the alarm by calling loudly after her master saying here is a runaway negro Jack said that he was going to knock her down but her master was out within one moment and he had to run for his life As soon as we got our eyes fixed on the North Star again we started on our way We travelled on a few miles and came to another large plantation where Jack was determined to get something to eat He left me at a certain place while he went up to the house to find something if possible He was gone some time before he returned but when I saw him coming he appeared to be very heavy loaded with a bag of something We walked off pretty fast until we got some distance in the woods Jack then stopped and opened his bag in which he had six small pigs I asked him how he got them without making any noise and he said that he found a bed of hogs in which there were the pigs with their mother While the pigs were sucking he crawled up to them without being discovered by the sow and took them by their necks one after another and choked them to death and slipped them into his bag We intended to travel on all that night and lay by the next day in the forest and cook up our pigs We fell into a large road leading on the direction which we were travelling and had not proceeded over three miles before I found a white hat in the road before me Jack being a little behind me I stopped until he came up and showed it to him He picked it up We looked a few steps farther and saw a man lying by the way either asleep or intoxicated as we supposed I told Jack not to take the hat but he would not obey me He had only a piece of a hat himself which he left in exchange for the other We travelled on about five miles farther and in passing a house discovered a large turkey sitting on the fence which temptation was greater than Jack could resist Notwithstanding he had six very nice fat little pigs on his back he stepped up and took the turkey off the fence By this time it was getting near day light and we left the road and went off a mile or so among the hills of the forest where we struck camp for the day We then picked our turkey dressed our pigs and cooked two of them We got the hair off by singeing them over the fire and after we had eaten all we wanted one of us slept while the other watched We had flint punk and powder to strike fire with A little after dark the next night we started on our way But about ten o'clock that night just as we were passing through a thick skirt of woods five men sprang out before us with fire arms swearing if we moved another step they would shoot us down and each man having his gun drawn up for shooting we had no chance to make any defence and surrendered sooner than run the risk of being killed They had been lying in wait for us there for several hours They had seen a reward out for notices were put up in the most public places that fifty dollars would be paid for me dead or alive if I should not return home within so many days And the reader will remember that neither Jack nor myself was able to read the advertisement It was of very little consequence with the slave catchers whether they killed us or took us alive for the reward was the same to them Illustration Illustration After we were taken and tied one of the men declared to me that he would have shot me dead just as sure as he lived if I had moved one step after they commanded us to stop He had his gun levelled at my breast already cocked and his finger on the trigger The way they came to find us out was from the circumstance of Jack's taking the man's hat in connection with the advertisement The man whose hat was taken was drunk and the next morning when he came to look for his hat it was gone and Jack's old hat lying in the place of it and in looking round he saw the tracks of two persons in the dust who had passed during the night and one of them having but three toes on one foot He followed these tracks until they came to a large mud pond in a lane on one side of which a person might pass dry shod but the man with three toes on one foot had plunged through the mud This led the man to think there must be runaway slaves and from out of that neighborhood for all persons in that settlement knew which side of that mud hole to go He then got others to go with him and they followed us until our track left the road They supposed that we had gone off in the woods to lay by until night after which we should pursue our course After we were captured they took us off several miles to where one of them lived and kept us over night One of our pigs was cooked for us to eat that night and the turkey the next morning But we were both tied that night with our hands behind us and our feet were also tied The doors were looked and a bedstead was set against the front door and two men slept in it to prevent our getting out in the night They said that they knew how to catch runaway negroes and how to keep them after they were caught They remarked that after they found we had stopped to lay by until night and they saw from our tracks what direction we were travelling they went about ten miles on that direction and hid by the road side until we came up that night That night after all had got fast to sleep I thought I would try to get out and I should have succeeded if I could have moved the bed from the door I managed to untie myself and crawled under the bed which was placed at the door and strove to remove it but in so doing I awakened the men and they got up and confined me again and watched me until day light each with a gun in hand The next morning they started with us back to Deacon Whitfield's plantation but when they got within ten miles of where he lived they stopped at a public house to stay over night and who should we meet there but the Deacon who was then out looking for me The reader may well imagine how I felt to meet him I had almost as soon come in contact with Satan himself He had two long poles or sticks of wood brought into confine us to I was compelled to lie on my back across one of those sticks with my arms out and have them lashed fast to the log with a cord My feet were also tied to the other and there I had to lie all that night with my back across this stick of wood and my feet and bands tied I suffered that night under the most excruciating pain From the tight binding of the cord the circulation of the blood in my arms and feet was almost entirely stopped If the night had been much longer I must have died in that confinement The next morning we were taken back to the Deacon's farm and both flogged for going off and set to work But there was some allowance made me on account of my being young They said they knew old Jack had pursuaded me off or I never would have gone And the Deacon's wife begged that I might be favored some for that time as Jack had influenced me so as to bring up my old habits of running away that I had entirely given up XIII I am sold to gamblers They try to purchase my family Our parting scene My good usage I am sold to an Indian His confidence in my integrity manifested THE reader will remember that this brings me back to the time the Deacon had ordered me to be kept in confinement until he got a chance to sell me and that no negro should ever get away from him and live Some days after this we were all out at the gin house ginning cotton which was situated on the road side and there came along a company of men fifteen or twenty in number who were Southern sportsmen Their attention was attracted by the load of iron which was fastened about my neck with a bell attached They stopped and asked the Deacon what that bell was put on my neck for and he said it was to keep me from running away c They remarked that I looked as if I might be a smart negro and asked if he wanted to sell me The reply was yes They then got off their horses and struck a bargain with him for me They bought me at a reduced price for speculation After they had purchased me I asked the privilege of going to the house to take leave of my family before I left which was granted by the sportsmen But the Deacon said I should never again step my foot inside of his yard and advised the sportsmen not to take the irons from my neck until they had sold me that if they gave me the least chance I would run away from them as I did from him So I was compelled to mount a horse and go off with them as I supposed never again to meet my family in this life We had not proceeded far before they informed me that they had bought me to sell again and if they kept the irons on me it would be detrimental to the sale and that they would therefore take off the irons and dress me up like a man and throw away the old rubbish which I then had on and they would sell me to some one who would treat me better than Deacon Whitfield After they had cut off the irons and dressed me up they crossed over Red River into Texas where they spent some time horse racing and gambling and although they were wicked black legs of the basest character it is but due to them to say that they used me far better than ever the Deacon did They gave me plenty to eat and put nothing hard on me to do They expressed much sympathy for me in my bereavement and almost every day they gave me money more or less and by my activity in waiting on them and upright conduct I got into the good graces of them all but they could not get any person to buy me an account of the amount of intelligence which they supposed me to have for many of them thought that I could read and write When they left Texas they intended to go to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi to attend a great horse race which was to take place Not being much out of their way to go past Deacon Whitfield's again I prevailed on them to call on him for the purpose of trying to purchase my wife and child and I promised them that if they would buy my wife and child I would get some person to purchase us from them So they tried to grant my request by calling on the Deacon and trying to make the purchase As we approached the Deacon's plantation my heart was filled with a thousand painful and fearful apprehensions I had the fullest confidence in the blacklegs with whom I travelled believing that they would do according to promise and go to the fullest extent of their ability to restore peace and consolation to a bereaved family to re unite husband and wife parent and child who had long been severed by slavery through the agency of Deacon Whitfield But I knew his determination in relation to myself and I feared his wicked opposition to a restoration of myself and little family which he had divided and soon found that my fears were not without foundation When we rode up and walked into his yard the Deacon came out and spoke to all but myself and not finding me in tattered rags as a substitute for clothes nor having an iron collar bell about my neck as was the case when he sold me he appeared to be much displeased What did you bring that negro back here for said he We have come to try to buy his wife and child for we can find no one who is willing to buy him alone and we will either buy or sell so that the family may be together said they While this conversation was going on my poor bereaved wife who never expected to see me again in this life spied me and came rushing to me through the crowd throwing her arms about my neck exclaiming in the most sympathetic tones Oh my dear husband I never expected to see you again The poor woman was bathed with tears of sorrow and grief But no sooner had she reached me than the Deacon peremptorily commanded her to go to her work This she did not obey but prayed that her master would not separate us again as she was there alone far from friends and relations whom she should never meet again And now to take away her husband her last and only true friend would be like taking her life But such appeals made no impression on the unfeeling Deacon's heart While he was storming with abusive language and even using the gory lash with hellish vengeance to separate husband and wife I could see the sympathetic tear drop stealing its way down the cheek of the profligate and black leg whose object it now was to bind up the broken heart of a wife and restore to the arms of a bereaved husband his companion They were disgusted at the conduct of Whitfield and cried out shame even in his presence They told him that they would give a thousand dollars for my wife and child or any thing in reason But no he would sooner see me to the devil than indulge or gratify me after my having run away from him and if they did not remove me from his presence very soon he said he should make them suffer for it But all this and even the gory lash had yet failed to break the grasp of poor Malinda whose prospect of connubial social and future happiness was all at stake When the dear woman saw there was no help for us and that we should soon be separated forever in the name of Deacon Whitfield and American slavery to meet no more as husband and wife parent and child the last and loudest appeal was made on our knees We appealed to the God of justice and to the sacred ties of humanity but this was all in vain The louder we prayed the harder he whipped amid the most heart rending shrieks from the poor slave mother and child as little Frances stood by sobbing at the abuse inflicted on her mother Oh how shall I give my husband the parting hand never to meet again This will surely break my heart were her parting words I can never describe to the reader the awful reality of that separation for it was enough to chill the blood and stir up the deepest feeling of revenge in the hearts of slaveholding black legs who as they stood by were threatening some weeping some swearing and others declaring vengeance against such treatment being inflicted on a human being As we left the plantation as far as we could see and hear the Deacon was still laying on the gory lash trying to prevent poor Malinda from weeping over the loss of her departed husband who was then by the hellish laws of slavery to her theoretically and Illustration Oh how shall I give my husband the parting hand never to meet again practically dead One of the black legs exclaimed that hell was full of just such Deacon's as Whitfield This occurred in December I have never seen Malinda since that period I never expect to see her again The sportsmen to whom I was sold showed their sympathy for me not only by word but by deeds They said that they had made the most liberal offer to Whitfield to buy or sell for the sole purpose of reuniting husband and wife But he stood out against it they felt sorry for me They said they had bought me to speculate on and were not able to lose what they had paid for me But they would make a bargain with me if I was willing and would lay a plan by which I might yet get free If I would use my influence so as to get some person to buy me while traveling about with them they would give me a portion of the money for which they sold me and they would also give me directions by which I might yet run away and go to Canada This offer I accepted and the plot was made They advised me to act very stupid in language and thought but in business I must be spry and that I must persuade men to buy me and promise them that I would be smart We passed through the State of Arkansas and stopped at many places horse racing and gambling My business was to drive a wagon in which they carried their gambling apparatus clothing c I had also to black boots and attend to horses We stopped at Fayettville where they almost lost me betting on a horse race They went from thence to the Indian Territory among the Cherokee Indians to attend the great races which were to take place there During the races there was a very wealthy half Indian of that tribe who became much attached to me and had some notion of buying me after hearing that I was for sale being a slaveholder The idea struck me rather favorable for several reasons First I thought I should stand a better chance to get away from an Indian than from a white man Second he wanted me only for a kind of a body servant to wait on him and in this case I knew that I should fare better than I should in the field And my owners also told me that it would be an easy place to get away from I took their advice for fear I might not get another chance so good as that and prevailed on the man to buy me He paid them nine hundred dollars in gold and silver for me I saw the money counted out After the purchase was made the sportsmen got me off to one side and according to promise they gave me a part of the money and directions how to get from there to Canada They also advised me how to act until I got a good chance to run away I was to embrace the earliest opportunity of getting away before they should become acquainted with me I was never to let it be known where I was from nor where I was born I was to act quite stupid and ignorant And when I started I was to go up the boundary line between the Indian Territory and the States of Arkansas and Missouri and this would fetch me out on the Missouri river near Jefferson city the capital of Missouri I was to travel at first by night and to lay by in daylight until I got out of danger The same afternoon that the Indian bought me he started with me to his residence which was fifty or sixty miles distant And so great was his confidence in me that he intrusted me to carry his money The amount must have been at least five hundred dollars which was all in gold and silver and when we stopped over night the money and horses were all left in my charge It would have been a very easy matter for me to have taken one of the best horses with the money and run off And the temptation was truly great to a man like myself who was watching for the earliest opportunity to escape and I felt confident that I should never have a better opportunity to escape full handed than then XIV Character of my Indian Master Slavery among the Indians less cruel Indian carousal Enfeebled health of my Indian Master His death My escape Adventure in a wigwam Successful progress toward liberty THE next morning I went home with my new master and by the way it is only doing justice to the dead to say that he was the most reasonable and humane slaveholder that I have ever belonged to He was the last man that pretended to claim property in my person and although I have freely given the names and residences of all others who have held me as a slave for prudential reasons I shall omit giving the name of this individual He was the owner of a large plantation and quite a number of slaves He raised corn and wheat for his own consumption only There was no cotton tobacco or anything of the kind produced among them for market And I found this difference between negro slavery among the Indians and the same thing among the white slaveholders of the South The Indians allow their slaves enough to eat and wear They have no overseers to whip nor drive them If a slave offends his master he sometimes in a heat of passion undertakes to chastise him but it is as often the case as otherwise that the slave gets the better of the fight and even flogs his master This singular fact is corroborated in a letter read by the publisher from an acquaintance while passing through this country in for which there is no law to punish him but when the fight is over that is the last of it So far as religious instruction is concerned they have it on terms of equality the bond and the free they have no respect of persons they have neither slave laws nor negro pews Neither do they separate husbands and wives nor parents and children All things considered if I must be a slave I had by far rather be a slave to an Indian than to a white man from the experience I have had with both A majority of the Indians were uneducated and still followed up their old heathen traditional notions They made it a rule to have an Indian dance or frolic about once a fortnight and they would come together far and near to attend these dances They would most generally commence about the middle of the afternoon and would give notice by the blowing of horns One would commence blowing and another would answer and so it would go all round the neighborhood When a number had got together they would strike a circle about twenty rods in circumference and kindle up fires about twenty feet apart all around in this circle In the centre they would have a large fire to dance around and at each one of the small fires there would be a squaw to keep up the fire which looked delightful off at a distance But the most degrading practice of all was the use of intoxicating drinks which were used to a great excess by all that attended these stump dances At almost all of these fires there was some one with rum to sell There would be some dancing some singing some gambling some fighting and some yelling and this was kept up often for two days and nights together Their dress for the dance was most generally a great bunch of bird feathers coon tails or something of the kind stuck in their heads and a great many shells tied about their legs to rattle while dancing Their manner of dancing is taking hold of each others hands and forming a ring around the large fire in the centre and go stomping around it until they would get drunk or their heads would get to swimming and then they would go off and drink and another set come on Such were some of the practises indulged in by these Indian slaveholders My last owner was in a declining state of health when he bought me and not long after he bought me he went off forty or fifty miles from home to be doctored by an Indian doctor accompanied by his wife I was taken along also to drive the carriage and to wait upon him during his sickness But he was then so feeble that his life was of but short duration after the doctor commenced on him While he lived I waited on him according to the best of my ability I watched over him night and day until he died and even prepared his body for the tomb before I left him He died about midnight and I understood from his friends that he was not to be buried until the second day after his death I pretended to be taking on at a great rate about his death but I was more excited about running away than I was about that and before daylight the next morning I proved it for I was on my way to Canada I never expected a better opportunity would present itself for my escape I slipped out of the room as if I had gone off to weep for the deceased knowing that they would not feel alarmed about me until after my master was buried and they had returned back to his residence And even then they would think that I was somewhere on my way home and it would be at least four or five days before they would make any stir in looking after me By that time if I had no bad luck I should be out of much danger After the first day I laid by in the day and traveled by night for several days and nights passing in this way through several tribes of Indians I kept pretty near the boundary line I recollect getting lost one dark rainy night Not being able to find the road I came into an Indian settlement at the dead hour of the night I was wet wearied cold and hungry and yet I felt afraid to enter any of their houses or wigwams not knowing whether they would be friendly or not But I knew the Indians were generally drunkards and that occasionally a drunken white man was found straggling among them and that such an one would be more likely to find friends from sympathy than an upright man So I passed myself off that night as a drunkard among them I walked up to the door of one of their houses and fell up against it making a great noise like a drunken man but no one came to the door I opened it and staggered in falling about and making a great noise But finally an old woman got up and gave me a blanket to lie down on There was quite a number of them lying about on the dirt floor but not one could talk or understand a word of the English language I made signs so as to let them know that I wanted something to eat but they had nothing so I had to go without that night I laid down and pretended to be asleep but I slept none that night for I was afraid that they would kill me if I went to sleep About one hour before day the next morning three of the females got up and put into a tin kettle a lot of ashes with water to boil and then poured into it about one quart of corn After letting it stand a few moments they poured it into a trough and pounded it into thin hominy They washed it out and boiled it down and called me up to eat my breakfast of it After eating I offered them six cents but they refused to accept it I then found my way to the main road and traveled all that day on my journey and just at night arrived at a public house kept by an Indian who also kept a store I walked in and asked if I could get lodging which was granted but I had not been there long before three men came riding up about dusk or between sunset and dark They were white men and I supposed slaveholders At any rate when they asked if they could have lodging I trembled for fear they might be in pursuit of me But the landlord told them that he could not lodge them but they could get lodging about two miles off with a white man and they turned their horses and started The landlord asked me where I was traveling to and where I was from I told him that I had been out looking at the country that I had thought of buying land and that I lived in the State of Ohio in the village of Perrysburgh He then said that he had lived there himself and that he had acted as an interpreter there among the Maumee tribe of Indians for several years He then asked who I was acquainted with there I informed him that I knew Judge Hollister Francis Hollister J W Smith and others At this he was so much pleased that he came up and took me by the hand and received me joyfully after seeing that I was acquainted with those of his old friends I could converse with him understandingly from personal acquaintance for I had lived there when I first ran away from Kentucky But I felt it to be my duty to start off the next morning before breakfast or sunrise I bought a dozen of eggs and had them boiled to carry with me to eat on the way I did not like the looks of those three men and thought I would get on as fast as possible for fear I might be pursued by them I was then about to enter the territory of another slave State Missouri I had passed through the fiery ordeal of Sibley Gatewood and Garrison and had even slipped through the fingers of Deacon Whitfield I had doubtless gone through great peril in crossing the Indian territory in passing through the various half civilized tribes who seemed to look upon me with astonishment as I passed along Their hands were almost invariably filled with bows and arrows tomahawks guns butcher knives and all the various implements of death which are used by them And what made them look still more frightful their faces were often painted red and their heads muffled with birds feathers bushes coons tails and owls heads But all this I had passed through and my long enslaved limbs and spirit were then in full stretch for emancipation I felt as if one more short struggle would set me free XV Adventure on the Prairie I borrow a horse without leave Rapid traveling one whole night Apology for using other men's horses My manner of living on the road EARLY in the morning I left the Indian territory as I have already said for fear I might be pursued by the three white men whom I had seen there over night but I had not proceeded far before my fears were magnified a hundred fold I always dreaded to pass through a prairie and on coming to one which was about six miles in width I was careful to look in every direction to see whether there was any person in sight before I entered it but I could see no one So I started across with a hope of crossing without coming in contact with any one on the prairie I walked as fast as I could but when I got about midway of the prairie I came to a high spot where the road forked and three men came up from a low spot as if they had been there concealed They were all on horse back and I supposed them to be the same men that had tried to get lodging where I stopped over night Had this been in timbered land I might have stood some chance to have dodged them but there I was out in the open prairie where I could see no possible way by which I could escape They came along slowly up behind me and finally passed and spoke or bowed their heads oil passing but they traveled in a slow walk and kept but a very few steps before me until we got nearly across the prairie When we were coming near a plantation a piece off from the road on the skirt of the timbered land they whipped up their horses and left the road as if they were going across to this plantation They soon got out of my sight by going down into a valley which lay between us and the plantation Not seeing them rise the hill to go up to the farm excited greater suspicion in my mind so I stepped over on the brow of the hill where I could see what they were doing and to my surprise I saw them going right back in the direction they had just came and they were going very fast I was then satisfied that they were after me and that they were only going back to get more help to assist them in taking me for fear that I might kill some of them if they undertook it The first impression was that I had better leave the road immediately so I bolted from the road and ran as fast as I could for some distance in the thick forest and concealed myself for about fifteen or twenty minutes which were spent in prayer to God for his protecting care and guidance My impression was that when they should start in pursuit of me again they would follow on in the direction which I was going when they left me and not finding or hearing of me on the road they would come back and hunt through the woods around and if they could find no track they might go and get dogs to trace me out I thought my chance of escape would be better if I went back to the same side of the road that they first went for the purpose of deceiving them as I supposed that they would not suspect my going in the same direction that they went for the purpose of escaping from them So I traveled all that day square off from the road through the wild forest without any knowledge of the country whatever for I had nothing to travel by but the sun by day and the moon and stars by night Just before night I came in sight of a large plantation where I saw quite a number of horses running at large in a field and knowing that my success in escaping depended upon my getting out of that settlement within twenty four hours to save myself from everlasting slavery I thought I should be justified in riding one of those horses that night if I could catch one I cut a grape vine with my knife and made it into a bridle and shortly after dark I went into the field and tried to catch one of the horses I got a bunch of dry blades of fodder and walked up softly towards the horses calling to them cope cope cope but there was only one out of the number that I was able to get my hand on and that was an old mare which I supposed to be the mother of all the rest and I knew that I could walk faster than she could travel She had a bell on and was very thin a flesh she looked gentle and walked on three legs only The young horses pranced and galloped off I was not able to get near them and the old mare being of no use to me I left them all After fixing my eyes on the north star I pursued my journey holding on to my bridle with a hope of finding a horse upon which I might ride that night I found a road leading pretty nearly in the direction which I wanted to travel and I kept it After traveling several miles I found another large plantation where there was a prospect of finding a horse I stopped up to the barn yard wherein I found several horses There was a little barn standing with the door open and I found it quite an easy task to get the horses into the barn and select out the best looking one of them I pulled down the fence led the noble beast out and mounted him taking a northern direction being able to find a road which led that way But I had not gone over three or four miles before I came to a large stream of water which was past fording yet I could see that it had been forded by the road track but from high water it was then impassible As the horse seemed willing to go in I put him through but before he got in far he was in water up to his sides and finally the water came over his back and he swam over I got as wet as could be but the horse carried me safely across at the proper place After I got out a mile or so from the river I came into a large prairie which I think must have been twenty or thirty miles in width and the road run across it about in the direction that I wanted to go I laid whip to the horse and I think he must have carried me not less than forty miles that night or before sun rise the next morning I then stopped him in a spot of high grass in an old field and took off the bridle I thanked God and thanked the horse for what he had done for me and wished him a safe journey back home I know the poor horse must have felt stiff and tired from his speedy jaunt and I felt very bad myself riding at that rate all night without a saddle but I felt as if I had too much at stake to favor either horse flesh or man flesh I could indeed afford to crucify my own flesh for the sake of redeeming myself from perpetual slavery Some may be disposed to find fault with my taking the horse as I did but I did nothing more than nine out of ten would do if they were placed in the same circumstances I had no disposition to steal a horse from any man But I ask if a white man had been captured by the Cherokee Indians and carried away from his family for life into slavery and could see a chance to escape and get back to his family should the Indians pursue him with a determination to take him back or take his life would it be a crime for the poor fugitive whose life liberty and future happiness were all at stake to mount any man's horse by the way side and ride him without asking any questions to effect his escape Or who would not do the same thing to rescue a wife child father or mother Such an act committed by a white man under the same circumstances would not only be pronounced proper but praiseworthy and if he neglected to avail himself of such a means of escape he would be pronounced a fool Therefore from this act I have nothing to regret for I have done nothing more than any other reasonable person would have done under the same circumstances But I had good luck from the morning I left the horse until I got back into the State of Ohio About two miles from where I left the horse I found a public house on the road where I stopped and took breakfast Being asked where I was traveling I replied that I was going home to Perrysburgh Ohio and that I had been out to look at the land in Missouri with a view of buying They supposed me to be a native of Ohio from the fact of my being so well acquainted with its location its principal cities inhabitants c The next night I put up at one of the best hotels in the village where I stopped and acted with as much independence as if I was worth a million of dollars talked about buying land stock and village property and contrasting it with the same kind of property in the State of Ohio In this kind of talk they were most generally interested and I was treated just like other travelers I made it a point to travel about thirty miles each day on my way to Jefferson city On several occasions I have asked the landlords where I have stopped over night if they could tell me who kept the best house where I would stop the next night which was most generally in a small village But for fear I might forget I would get them to give me the name on a piece of paper as a kind of recommend This would serve as an introduction through which I have always been well received from one landlord to another and I have always stopped at the best houses eaten at the first tables and slept in the best beds No man ever asked me whether I was bond or free black or white rich or poor but I always presented a bold front and showed the best side out which was all the pass I had But when I got within about one hundred miles of Jefferson city where I expected to take a Steamboat passage to St Louis I stopped over night at a hotel where I met with a young white man who was traveling on to Jefferson City on horse back and was also leading a horse with a saddle and bridle on I asked him if he would let me ride the horse which he was leading as I was going to the same city He said that it was a hired horse that he was paying at the rate of fifty cents per day for it but if I would pay the same I could ride him I accepted the offer and we rode together to the city We were on the road together two or three days stopped and ate and slept together at the same hotels XVI Stratagem to get on board the steamer My Irish friends My success in reaching Cincinnati Reflections on again seeing Kentucky I get employment in a hotel My fright at seeing the gambler who sold me I leave Ohio with Mr Smith His letter My education THE greatest of my adventures came off when I arrived at Jefferson City There I expected to meet an advertisement for my person it was there I must cross the river or take a steamboat down it was there I expected to be interrogated and required to prove whether I was actually a free man or a slave If I was free I should have to show my free papers and if I was a slave I should be required to tell who my master was I stopped at a hotel however and ascertained that there was a steamboat expected down the river that day for St Louis I also found out that there were several passengers at that house who were going down on board of the first boat I knew that the captain of a steamboat could not take a colored passenger on board his boat from a slave state without first ascertaining whether such person was bond or free I knew that this was more than he would dare to do by the laws of the slave states and now to surmount this difficulty it brought into exercise all the powers of my mind I would have got myself boxed up as freight and have been forwarded to St Louis but I had no friend that I could trust to do it for me This plan has since been adopted by some with success But finally I thought I might possibly pass myself off as a body servant to the passengers going from the hotel down So I went to a store and bought myself a large truck and took it to the hotel Soon a boat came in which was bound to St Louis and the passengers started down to get on board I took up my large truck and started along after them as if I was their servant My heart trembled in view of the dangerous experiment which I was then about to try It required all the moral courage that I was master of to bear me up in view of my critical condition The white people that I was following walked on board and I after them I acted as if the truck was full of clothes but I had not a stitch of clothes in it The passengers went up into the cabin and I followed them with the trunk I suppose this made the captain think that I was their slave I not only took the trunk in the cabin but stood by it until after the boat had started as if it belonged to my owners and I was taking care of it for them but as soon as the boat got fairly under way I knew that some account would have to be given of me so I took my trunk down on the deck among the deck passengers to prepare myself to meet the clerk of the boat when he should come to collect fare from the deck passengers Fortunately for me there was quite a number of deck passengers on board among whom there were many Irish I insinuated myself among them so as to get into their good graces believing that if I should get into a difficulty they would stand by me I saw several of these persons going up to the saloon buying whiskey and I thought this might be the most effectual way by which I could gain speedily their respect and sympathy So I participated with them pretty freely for awhile or at least until after I got my fare settled I placed myself in a little crowd of them and invited them all up to the bar with me stating that it was my treat This was responded to and they walked up and drank and I footed the bill This of course brought us into a kind of a union We sat together and laughed and talked freely Within ten or fifteen minutes I remarked that I was getting dry again and invited them up and treated again By this time I was thought to be one of the most liberal and gentlemanly men on board by these deck passengers they were ready to do any thing for me they got to singing songs and telling long yarns in which I took quite an active part but it was all for effect By this time the porter came around ringing his bell for all passengers who had not paid their fare to walk up to the captain's office and settle it Some of my Irish friends had not yet settled and I asked one of them if he would be good enough to take my money and get me a ticket when he was getting one for himself and he quickly replied yes sir I will get you a tacket So he relieved me of my greatest trouble When they came round to gather the tickets before we got to St Louis my ticket was taken with the rest and no questions were asked me The next day the boat arrived at St Louis my object was to take passage on board of the first boat which was destined for Cincinnati Ohio and as there was a boat going out that day for Pittsburgh I went on board to make some inquiry about the fare c and found the steward to be a colored man with whom I was acquainted He lived in Cincinnati and had rendered me some assistance in making my escape to Canada in the summer of and he also very kindly aided me then in getting back into a land of freedom The swift running steamer started that afternoon on her voyage which soon wafted my body beyond the tyrannical limits of chattel slavery When the boat struck the mouth of the river Ohio and I had once more the pleasure of looking on that lovely stream my heart leaped up for joy at the glorious prospect that I should again be free Every revolution of the mighty steam engine seemed to bring me nearer and nearer the promised land Only a few days had elapsed before I was permitted by the smiles of a good providence once more to gaze on the green hill tops and valleys of old Kentucky the State of my nativity And notwithstanding I was deeply interested while standing on the deck of the steamer looking at the beauties of nature on either side of the river as she pressed her way up the stream my very soul was pained to look upon the slaves in the fields of Kentucky still toiling under their task masters without pay It was on this soil I first breathed the free air of Heaven and felt the bitter pangs of slavery it was here that I first learned to abhor it It was here I received the first impulse of human rights it was here that I first entered my protest against the bloody institution of slavery by running away from it and declared that I would no longer work for any man as I had done without wages When the steamboat arrived at Portsmouth Ohio I took off my trunk with the intention of going to Canada But my funds were almost exhausted so I had to stop and go to work to get money to travel on I hired myself at the American Hotel to a Mr McCoy to do the work of a porter to black boots c for which he was to pay me per month I soon found the landlord to be bad pay and not only that but he would not allow me to charge for blacking boots although I had to black them after everybody had gone to bed at night and set them in the barroom where the gentlemen could come and get them in the morning while I was at other work I had nothing extra for this neither would he pay me my regular wages so I thought this was a little too much like slavery and devised a plan by which I got some pay for my work I made it a point never to blacken all the boots and shoes over night neither would I put any of them in the bar room but lock them up in a room where no one could get them without calling for me I got a piece of broken vessel placed it in the room just before the boots and put into it several pieces of small change as if it had been given me for boot blacking and almost every one that came in after their boots would throw some small trifle into my contribution box while I was there blacking away In this way I made more than my landlord paid me and I soon got a good stock of cash again One morning I blacked a gentleman's boots who came in during the night by a steamboat After he had put on his boots I was called into the bar room to button his straps and while I was performing this service not thinking to see anybody that knew me I happened to look up at the man's face and who should it be but one of the very gamblers who had recently sold me I dropped his foot and bolted from the room as if I had been struck by an electric shock The man happened not to recognize me but this strange conduct on my part excited the landlord who followed me out to see what was the matter He found me with my hand to my breast groaning at a great rate He asked me what was the matter but I was not able to inform him correctly but said that I felt very bad indeed He of course thought I was sick with the colic and ran in the house and got some hot stuff for me with spice ginger c But I never got able to go into the bar room until long after breakfast time when I knew this man was gone then I got well And yet I have no idea that the man would have hurt a hair of my head but my first thought was that he was after me I then made up my mind to leave Portsmouth its location being right on the border of a slave State A short time after this a gentleman put up there over night named Smith from Perrysburgh with whom I was acquainted in the North He was on his way to Kentucky to buy up a drove of fine horses and he wanted me to go and help him to drive his horses out to Perrysburgh and said he would pay all my expenses if I would go So I made a contract to go and agreed to meet him the next week on a set day in Washington Ky to start with his drove to the north Accordingly at the time I took a steamboat passage down to Maysville near where I was to meet Mr Smith with my trunk When I arrived at Maysville I found that Washington was still six miles back from the river I stopped at a hotel and took my breakfast and who should I see there but a captain of a boat who saw me but two years previous going down the river Ohio with handcuffs on in a chain gang but he happened not to know me I left my trunk at the hotel and went out to Washington where I found Mr Smith and learned that he was not going to start off with his drove until the next day The followig letter which was addressed to the committee to investigate the truth of my narrative will explain this part of it to the reader and corroborate my statements MAUMBE CITY April CHAS H STEWART ESQ DEAR SIR Your favor of th February addressed to me at Perrysburgh was not received until yesterday having removed to this place the letter was not forwarded as it should have been In reply to your inquiry respecting Henry Bibb I can only say that about the year I became acquainted with him at Perrysburgh employed him to do some work by the job which he performed well and from his apparent honesty and candor I became much interested in him About that time he went South for the purpose as was said of getting his wife who was there in slavery In the spring of I found him at Portsmouth on the Ohio river and after much persuasion employed him to assist my man to drive home some horses and cattle which I was about purchasing near Maysville Ky My confidence in him was such that when about half way home I separated the horses from the cattle and left him with the latter with money and instructions to hire what help he wanted to get to Perrysburgh This he accomplished to my entire satisfaction He worked for me during the summer and I was unwilling to part with him but his desire to go to school and mature plans for the liberation of his wife were so strong that he left for Detroit where he could enjoy the society of his colored brethren I have heard his story and must say that I have not the least reason to suspect it being otherwise than true and furthermore I firmly believe and have for a long time that he has the foundation to make himself useful I shall always afford him all the facilities in my power to assist him until I hear of something in relation to him to alter my mind Yours in the cause of truth J W SMITH When I arrived at Perrysburgh I went to work for Mr Smith for several months This family I found to be one of the most kind hearted and unprejudiced that I ever lived with Mr and Mrs Smith lived up to their profession I resolved to go to Detroit that winter and go to school in January But when I arrived at Detroit I soon found that I was not able to give myself a very thorough education I was among strangers who were not disposed to show me any great favors I had every thing to pay for and clothing to buy so I graduated within three weeks And this was all the schooling that I have ever had in my life W C Monroe was my teacher to him I went about two weeks only My occupation varied according to circumstances as I was not settled in mind about the condition of my bereaved family for several years and could not settle myself down at any permanent business I saw occasionally fugitives from Kentucky some of whom I knew but none of them were my relatives none could give me the information which I desired most XVII Letter from W H Gatewood My reply My efforts as a public lecturer Singular incident in Steubenville Meeting with a friend of Whitfield in Michigan Outrage on a canal packet Fruitless efforts to find my wife THE first direct information that I received concerning any of my relations after my last escape from slavery was communicated in a letter from Wm H Gatewood my former owner which I here insert word for word without any correction BEDFORD TRIMBLE COUNTY KY Mr H BIBB DEAR SIR After my respects to you and yours c I received a small book which you sent to me that I peroseed and found it was sent by H Bibb I am a stranger in Detroit and know no man there without it is Walton H Bibb if this be the man please to write to me and tell me all about that place and the people I will tell you the news here as well as I can your mother is still living here and she is well the people are generally well in this cuntry times are dull and produce low give my compliments to King Jack and all my friends in that cuntry I read that book you sent me and think it will do very well George is sold I do not know any thing about him I have nothing more at present but remain yours c W H GATEWOOD February th P S You will please to answer this letter Never was I more surprised than at the reception of this letter it came so unexpected to me There had just been a State Convention held in Detroit by the free people of color the proceedings of which were published in pamphlet form I forwarded several of them to distinguished slaveholders in Kentucky one among others was Mr Gatewood and gave him to understand who sent it After showing this letter to several of my anti slavery friends and asking their opinions about the propriety of my answering it I was advised to do it as Mr Gatewood had no claim on me as a slave for he had sold and got the money for me and my family So I wrote him an answer as near as I can recollect in the following language DEAR SIR I am happy to inform you that you are not mistaken in the man whom you sold as property and received pay for as such But I thank God that I am not property now but am regarded as a man like yourself and although I live far north I am enjoying a comfortable living by my own industry If you should ever chance to be traveling this way and will call on me I will use you better than you did me while you held me as a slave Think not that I have any malice against you for the cruel treatment which you inflicted on me while I was in your power As it was the custom of your country to treat your fellow men as you did me and my little family I can freely forgive you I wish to be remembered in love to my aged mother and friends please tell her that if we should never meet again in this life my prayer shall be to God that we may meet in Heaven where parting shall be no more You wish to be remembered to King and Jack I am pleased sir to inform you that they are both here well and doing well They are both living in Canada West They are now the owners of better farms than the men are who once owned them You may perhaps think hard of us for running away from slavery but as to myself I have but one apology to make for it which is this I have only to regret that I did not start at an earlier period I might have been free long before I was But you had it in your power to have kept me there much longer than you did I think it is very probable that I should have been a toiling slave on your plantation to day if you had treated me differently To be compelled to stand by and see you whip and slash my wife without mercy when I could afford her no protection not even by offering myself to suffer the lash in her place was more than I felt it to be the duty of a slave husband to endure while the way was open to Canada My infant child was also frequently flogged by Mrs Gatewood for crying until its skin was bruised literally purple This kind of treatment was what drove me from home and family to seek a better home for them But I am willing to forget the past I should be Pleased to hear from you again on the reception of this and should also be very happy to correspond with you often if it should be agreeable to yourself I subscribe myself a friend to the oppressed and Liberty forever HENRY BIBB WILLIAM GATEWOOD Detroit March d The first time that I ever spoke before a public audience was to give a narration of my own sufferings and adventures connected with slavery I commenced in the village of Adrian State of Michigan May From that up to the present period the principle part of my time has been faithfully devoted to the cause of freedom nerved up and encouraged by the sympathy of anti slavery friends on the one hand and prompted by a sense of duty to my enslaved countrymen on the other especially when I remembered that slavery had robbed me of my freedom deprived me of education banished me from my native State and robbed me of my family I went from Michigan to the State of Ohio where I traveled over some of the Southern counties of that State in company with Samuel Brooks and Amos Dresser lecturing upon the subject of American Slavery The prejudice of the people at that time was very strong against the abolitionists so much so that they were frequently mobbed for discussing the subject We appointed a series of meetings along on the Ohio River in sight of the State of Virginia and in several places we had Virginians over to hear us upon the subject I recollect our having appointed a meeting in the city of Steubenville which is situated on the bank of the river Ohio There was but one known abolitionist living in that city named George Ore On the day of our meeting when we arrived in this splendid city there was not a church school house nor hall that we could get for love or money to hold our meeting in Finally I believe that the whigs consented to let us have the use of their club room to hold the meeting in but before the hour had arrived for us to commence they re considered the matter and informed us that we could not have the use of their house for an abolition meeting We then got permission to hold forth in the public market house and even then so great was the hostility of the rabble that they tried to bluff us off by threats and epithets Our meeting was advertised to take place at nine o'clock A M The pro slavery parties hired a colored man to take a large auction bell and go all over the city ringing it and crying ho ye ho ye Negro auction to take place in the market house at nine o'clock by George Ore This cry was sounded all over the city which called out many who would not otherwise have been present They came to see if it was really the case The object of the rabble in having the bell rung was to prevent us from attempting to speak But at the appointed hour Bro Dresser opened the meeting with prayer and Samuel Brooks mounted the block and spoke for fifteen or twenty minutes after which Mr Dresser took the block and talked about one hour upon the wickedness of slaveholding There were not yet many persons present They were standing off I suppose to see if I was to be offered for sale Many windows were hoisted and store doors open and they were looking and listening to what was said After Mr Dresser was through I was called to take the stand Just at this moment there was no small stir in rushing forward so much indeed that I thought they were coming up to mob me I should think that in less than fifteen minutes there were about one thousand persons standing around listening I saw many of them shedding tears while I related the sad story of my wrongs At twelve o'clock we adjourned the meeting to meet again at the same place at two P M Our afternoon meeting was well attended until nearly sunset at which time we saw some signs of a mob and adjourned The mob followed us that night to the house of Mr Ore and they were yelling like tigers until late that night around the house as if they wanted to tear it down In the fall of S B Treadwell of Jackson and myself spent two or three months in lecturing through the State of Michigan upon the abolition of slavery in a section of country where abolitionists were few and far between Our meetings were generally appointed in small log cabins school houses among the farmers which were some times crowded full and where they had no horse teams it was often the case that there would be four or five ox teams come loaded down with men women and children to attend our meetings But the people were generally poor and in many places not able to give us a decent night's lodging We most generally carried with us a few pounds of candles to light up the houses wherein we held our meetings after night for in many places they had neither candles nor candlesticks After meeting was out we have frequently gone from three to eight miles to get lodging through the dark forest where there was scarcely any road for a wagon to run on I have traveled for miles over swamps where the roads were covered with logs without any dirt over them which has sometimes shook and jostled the wagon to pieces where we could find no shop or any place to mend it We would have to tie it up with bark or take the lines to tie it with and lead the horse by the bridle At other times we were in mud up to the hubs of the wheels I recollect one evening we lectured in a little village where there happened to be a Southerner present who was a personal friend of Deacon Whitfield who became much offended at what I said about his Bro Whitfield and complained about it after the meeting was out He told the people not to believe a word I said that it was all a humbug They ask him how he knew Ah said he he has slandered Bro Whitfield I am well acquainted with him we both belonged to one church and Whitfield is one of the most respectable men in all that region of country They asked if he Whitfield was a slaveholder The reply was yes but he treated his slaves well Well said one that only proves that he has told us the truth for all we wish to know is that there is such a man as Whitfield as represented by Bibb and that he is a slave holder On the d Sept I started from Toledo on board the canal packet Erie for Cincinnati Ohio But before going on board I was waited on by one of the boat's crew who gave me a card of the boat upon which was printed that no pains would be spared to render all passengers comfortable who might favor them with their patronage to Cincinnati This card I slipped into my pocket supposing it might be of some use to me There were several drunken loafers on board going through as passengers one of whom used the most vulgar language in the cabin where there were ladies and even vomited But he was called a white man and a southerner which made it all right I of course took my place in the cabin with the rest and there was nothing said against it that night When the passengers went forward to settle their fare I paid as much as any other man which entitled me to the same privileges The next morning at the ringing of the breakfast bell the proprietor of the packet line Mr Samuel Doyle being on board invited the passengers to sit up to breakfast He also invited me personally to sit up to the table But after we were all seated and some had began to eat he came and ordered me up from the table and said I must wait until the rest were done I left the table without making any reply and walked out on the deck of the boat After breakfast the passengers came up and the cabin boy was sent after me to come to breakfast but I refused Shortly after this man who had ordered me from the table came up with the ladies I stepped up and asked him if he was the captain of the boat His answer was no that he was one of the proprietors I then informed him that I was going to leave his boat at the first stopping place but before leaving I wanted to ask him a few questions Have I misbehaved to any one on board of this boat Have I disobeyed any law of this boat No said he Have I not paid you as much as any other passenger through to Cincinnati Yes said he Then I am sure that I have been insulted and imposed upon on board of this boat without any just cause whatever No one has misused you for you ought to have known better than to have come to the table where there were white people Sir did you not ask me to come to the table Yes but I did not know that you was a colored man when I asked you and then it was better to insult one man than all the passengers on board of the boat Sir I do not believe that there is a gentleman or lady on board of this boat who would have considered it an insult for me to have taken my breakfast and you have imposed upon me by taking my money and promising to use me well and then to insult me as you have I don't want any of your jaw said he Sir with all due respect to your elevated station you have imposed upon me in a way which is unbecoming a gentleman I have paid my money and behaved myself as well as any other man and I am determined that no man shall impose on me as you have by deceiving me without my letting the world know it I would rather a man should rob me of my money at midnight than to take it in that way I left this boat at the first stopping place and took the next boat to Cincinnati On the last boat I had no cause to complain of my treatment When I arrived at Cincinnati I published a statement of this affair in the Daily Herald The next day Mr Doyle called on the editor in a great passion Here said he what does this mean What sir said the editor quietly Why the stuff here read it and see Read it yourself answered the editor Well I want to know if you sympathize with this nigger here Who Mr Bibb Why yes I think he is a gentleman and should be used as such Why this is all wrong all of it Put your finger on the place and I will right it Well he says that we took his money when we paid part back And if you take his part why I'll have nothing to do with your paper So ended his wrath In the anti slavery friends of Michigan employed me to take the field as an anti slavery Lecturer in that State during the Spring Summer and Fall pledging themselves to restore to me my wife and child if they were living and could be reached by human agency which may be seen by the following circular from the Signal of Liberty TO LIBERTY FRIENDS In the Signal of the th inst is a report from the undersigned respecting Henry Bibb His narrative always excites deep sympathy for himself and favorable bias for the cause which seeks to abolish the evils he so powerfully portrays Friends and foes attest his efficiency Mr Bibb has labored much in lecturing yet has collected but a bare pittance He has received from Ohio lucrative offers but we have prevailed on him to remain in this State We think that a strong obligation rests on the friends in this State to sustain Mr Bibb and restore to him his wife and child Under the expectation that Michigan will yield to these claims will support their laborer and re unite the long severed ties of husband and wife parent and child Mr Bibb will lecture through the whole State Our object is to prepare friends for the visit of Mr Bibb and to suggest an effective mode of operations for the whole State Let friends in each vicinity appoint a collector pay to him all contributions for the freedom of Mrs Bibb and child then transmit them to us We will acknowledge them in the Signal and be responsible for them We will see that the proper measures for the freedom of Mrs Bibb and child are taken and if it be within our means we will accomplish it nay we will accomplish it if the objects be living and the friends sustain us But should we fail the contributions will be held subject to the order of the donors less however by a proportionate deduction of expenses from each The hope of this re union will nerve the heart and body of Mr Bibb to re doubled effort in a cause otherwise dear to him And as he will devote his whole time systematically to the anti slavery cause he must also depend on friends for the means of livelihood We bespeak for him your hospitality and such pecuniary contributions as you can afford trusting that the latter may be sufficient to enable him to keep the field A L PORTER C H STEWART SILAS M HOLMES DETROIT APRIL I have every reason to believe that they acted faithfully in the matter but without success They wrote letters in every quarter where they would be likely to gain any information respecting her There were also two men sent from Michigan in the summer of down South to find her if possible and report and whether they found out her condition and refused to report I am not able to say but suffice it to say that they never have reported They were respectable men and true friends of the cause one of whom was a Methodist minister and the other a cabinet maker and both white men The small spark of hope which had still lingered about my heart had almost become extinct XVIII My last effort to recover my family Sad tidings of my wife Her degradation I am compelled to regard our relation as dissolved forever In view of the failure to hear any thing of my wife many of my best friends advised me to get married again if I could find a suitable person They regarded my former wife as dead to me and all had been done that could be But I was not yet satisfied myself to give up I wanted to know certainly what had become of her So in the winter of I resolved to go back to Kentucky my native State to see if I could hear anything from my family And against the advice of all my friends I went back to Cincinnati where I took passage on board of a Southern steamboat to Madison in the State of Indiana which was only ten miles from where Wm Gatewood lived who was my former owner No sooner had I landed in Madison than I learned on inquiry and from good authority that my wife was living in a state of adultery with her master and had been for the last three years This message she sent back to Kentucky to her mother and friends She also spoke of the time and manner of our separation by Deacon Whitfield my being taken off by the Southern blacklegs to where she knew not and that she had finally given me up The child she said was still with her Whitfield had sold her to this man for the above purposes at a high price and she was better used than ordinary slaves This was a death blow to all my hopes and pleasant plans While I was in Madison I hired a white man to go over to Bedford in Kentucky where my mother was then living and bring her over into a free State to see me I hailed her approach with unspeakable joy She informed me too on inquiring whether my family had ever been heard from that the report which I had just heard in relation to Malinda was substantially true for it was the same message that she had sent to her mother and friends And my mother thought it was no use for me to run any more risks or to grieve myself any more about her From that time I gave her into the hands of an all wise Providence As she was then living with another man I could no longer regard her as my wife After all the sacrifices sufferings and risks which I had run striving to rescue her from the grasp of slavery every prospect and hope was cut off She has ever since been regarded as theoretically and practically dead to me as a wife for she was living in a state of adultery according to the law of God and man Poor unfortunate woman I bring no charge of it against her for I know not all the circumstances connected with the case It is consistent with slavery however to suppose that she became reconciled to it from the fact of her sending word back to her friends and relatives that she was much better treated than she had ever been before and that she had also given me up It is also reasonable to suppose that there might have been some kind of attachment formed by living together in this way for years and it is quite probable that they have other children according to the law of nature which would have a tendency to unite them stronger together In view of all the facts and circumstances connected with this matter I deem further comments and explanations unnecessary on my part Finding myself thus isolated in this peculiarly unnatural state I resolved in to spend my days in traveling to advance the anti slavery cause I spent the summer in Michigan but in the subsequent fall I took a trip to New England where I spent the winter And there I found a kind reception where ever I traveled among the friends of freedom While traveling about in this way among strangers I was sometimes sick with no permanent home or bosom friend to sympathise or take that care of me which an affectionate wife would So I conceived the idea that it would be better for me to change my position provided I should find a suitable person In the month of May I attended the anti slavery anniversary in the city of New York where I had the good fortune to be introduced to the favor of a Miss Mary E Miles of Boston a lady whom I had frequently heard very highly spoken of for her activity and devotion to the anti slavery cause as well as her talents and learning and benevolence in the cause of reforms generally I was very much impressed with the personal appearance of Miss Miles and was deeply interested in our first interview because I found that her principles and my own were nearly one and the same I soon found by a few visits as well as by letters that she possessed moral principle and frankness of disposition which is often sought for but seldom found These in connection with other amiable qualities soon won my entire confidence and affection But this secret I kept to myself until I was fully satisfied that this feeling was reciprocal that there was indeed a congeniality of principles and feeling which time nor eternity could never change When I offered myself for matrimony we mutually engaged ourselves to each other to marry in one year with this condition viz that if either party should see any reason to change their mind within that time the contract should not be considered binding We kept up a regular correspondence during the time and in June we had the happiness to be joined in holy wedlock Not in slave holding style which is a mere farce without the sanction of law or gospel but in accordance with the laws of God and our country My beloved wife is a bosom friend a help meet a loving companion in all the social moral and religious relations of life She is to me what a poor slave's wife can never be to her husband while in the condition of a slave for she can not be true to her husband contrary to the will of her master She can neither be pure nor virtuous contrary to the will of her master She dare not refuse to be reduced to a state of adultery at the will of her master from the fact that the slaveholding law customs and teachings are all against the poor slaves I presume there are no class of people in the United States who so highly appreciate the legality of marriage as those persons who have been held and treated as property Yes it is that fugitive who knows from sad experience what it is to have his wife tyrannically snatched from his bosom by a slaveholding professor of religion and finally reduced to a state of adultery that knows how to appreciate the law that repels such high handed villany Such as that to which the writer has been exposed But thanks be to God I am now free from the hand of the cruel oppressor no more to be plundered of my dearest rights the wife of my bosom and my poor unoffending offspring Of Malinda I will only add a word in conclusion The relation once subsisting between us to which I clung hoping against hope for years after we were torn assunder not having been sanctioned by any loyal power cannot be cancelled by a legal process Voluntarily assumed without law mutually it was by her relinquished years ago without my knowledge as before named during which time I was making every effort to secure her restoration And it was not until after living alone in the world for more than eight years without a companion known in law or morals that I changed my condition XIX Comments on S Gatewood's letter about slaves stealing Their conduct vindicated Comments on W Gatewood's letter BUT it seems that I am not now beyond the reach of the foul slander of slaveholders They are not satisfied with selling and banishing me from my native State As soon as they got news of my being in the free North exposing their peculiar Institution a libelous letter was written by Silas Gatewood of Kentucky a son of one of my former owners to a Northern Committee for publication which he thought would destroy my influence and character This letter will be found in the introduction He has charged me with the awful crime of taking from my keeper and oppressor some of the fruits of my own labor for the benefit of myself and family But while writing this letter he seems to have overlooked the disgraceful fact that he was guilty himself of what would here be regarded highway robbery in his conduct to me as narrated on of this narrative A word in reply to Silas Gatewood's letter I am willing to admit all that is true but shall deny that which is so basely false In the first place he puts words in my mouth that I never used He says that I represented that my mother belonged to James Bibb I deny ever having said so in private or public He says that I stated that Bibb's daughter married a Sibley I deny it He also says that the first time that I left Kentucky for my liberty I was gone about two years before I went back to rescue my family I deny it I was gone from Dec th to May or June He says that I went back the second time for the purpose of taking off my family and eight or ten more slaves to Canada This I will not pretend to deny He says I was guilty of disposing of articles from the farm for my own use and pocketing the money and that his father caught me stealing a sack full of wheat I admit the fact I acknowledge the wheat And who had a better right to eat of the fruits of my own hard earnings than myself Many a long summer's day have I toiled with my wife and other slaves cultivating his father's fields and gathering in his harvest under the scorching rays of the sun without half enough to eat or clothes to wear and at the same time his meat house was filled with bacon and bread stuff his dairy with butter and cheese his barn with grain husbanded by the unrequited toil of the slaves And yet if a slave presumed to take a little from the abundance which he had made by his own sweat and toil to supply the demands of nature to quiet the craving appetite which is sometimes almost irresistible it is called stealing by slaveholders But I did not regard it as stealing then I do not regard it as such now I hold that a slave has a moral right to eat drink and wear all that he needs and that it would be a sin on his part to suffer and starve in a country where there is a plenty to eat and wear within his reach I consider that I had a just right to what I took because it was the labor of my own hands Should I take from a neighbor as a freeman in a free country I should consider myself guilty of doing wrong before God and man But was I the slave of Wm Gatewood to day or any other slaveholder working without wages and suffering with hunger or for clothing I should not stop to inquire whether my master would approve of my helping myself to what I needed to eat or wear For while the slave is regarded as property how can he steal from his master It is contrary to the very nature of the relation existing between master and slave from the fact that there is no law to punish a slave for theft but lynch law and the way they avoid that is to hide well For illustration a slave from the State of Virginia for cruel treatment left the State between daylight and dark being borne off by one of his master's finest horses and finally landed in Canada where the British laws recognise no such thing as property in a human being He was pursued by his owners who expected to take advantage of the British law by claiming him as a fugitive from justice and as such he was arrested and brought before the court of Queen's Bench They swore that he was at a certain time the slave of Mr A and that he ran away at such a time and stole and brought off a horse They enquired who the horse belonged to and it was ascertained that the slave and horse both belonged to the same person The court therefore decided that the horse and the man were both recognised in the State of Virginia alike as articles of property belonging to the same person therefore if there was theft committed on either side the former must have stolen off the latter the horse brought away the man and not the man the horse So the man was discharged and pronounced free according to the laws of Canada There are several other letters published in this work upon the same subject from slaveholders which it is hardly necessary for me to notice However I feel thankful to the writers for the endorsement and confirmation which they have given to my story No matter what their motives were they have done me and the anti slavery cause good service in writing those letters but more especially the Gatewood's Silas Gatewood has done more for me than all the rest He has labored so hard in his long communication in trying to expose me that he has proved every thing that I could have asked of him and for which I intend to reward him by forwarding him one of my books hoping that it may be the means of converting him from a slaveholder to an honest man and an advocate of liberty for all mankind The reader will see in the introduction that Wm Gatewood writes a more cautious letter upon the subject than his son Silas It is not a very easy matter to catch old birds with chaff and I presume if Silas had the writing of his letter over again he would not be so free in telling all he knew and even more for the sake of making out a strong case The object of his writing such a letter will doubtless be understood by the reader It was to destroy public confidence in the victims of slavery that the system might not be exposed it was to gag a poor fugitive who had undertaken to plead his own cause and that of his enslaved brethren It was a feeble attempt to suppress the voice of universal freedom which is now thundering on every gale But thank God it is too late in the day Go stop the mighty thunder's roar Go hush the ocean's sound Or upward like the eagle soar To skies' remotest bound And when thou hast the thunder stopped And hushed the ocean's waves Then freedom's spirit bind in chains And ever hold us slaves And when the eagle's boldest feat Thou canst perform with skill Then think to stop proud freedom's march And hold the bondman still XX Review of my narrative Licentiousness a prop of slavery A case of mild slavery given Its revolting features Times of my purchase and sale by professed Christians Concluding remarks I now conclude my narrative by reviewing briefly what I have written This little work has been written without any personal aid or a knowledge of the English grammer which must in part be my apology for many of its imperfections I find in several places where I have spoken out the deep feelings of my soul in trying to describe the horrid treatment which I have so often received at the hands of slaveholding professors of religion that I might possibly make a wrong impression on the minds of some northern freemen who are unacquainted theoretically or practically with the customs and treatment of American slaveholders to their slaves I hope that it may not be supposed by any that I have exaggerated in the least for the purpose of making out the system of slavery worse than it really is for to exaggerate upon the cruelties of this system would be almost impossible and to write herein the most horrid features of it would not be in good taste for my book I have long thought from what has fallen under my own observation while a slave that the strongest reason why southerners stick with such tenacity to their peculiar instiution is because licentious white men could not carry out their wicked purposes among the defenceless colored population as they now do without being exposed and punished by law if slavery was abolished Female virtue could not be trampled under foot with impunity and marriage among the people of color kept in utter obscurity On the other hand lest it should be said by slaveholders and their apologists that I have not done them the justice to give a sketch of the best side of slavery if there can be any best side to it therefore in conclusion they may have the benefit of the following case that fell under the observation of the writer And I challenge America to show a milder state of slavery than this I once knew a Methodist in the state of Ky by the name of Young who was the owner of a large number of slaves many of whom belonged to the same church with their master They worshipped together in the same church Mr Young never was known to flog one of his slaves or sell one He fed and clothed them well and never over worked them He allowed each family a small house to themselves with a little garden spot whereon to raise their own vegetables and a part of the day on Saturdays was allowed them to cultivate it In process of time he became deeply involved in debt by endorsing notes and his property was all advertised to be sold by the sheriff at public auction It consisted in slaves many of whom were his brothers and sisters in the church On the day of sale there were slave traders and speculators on the ground to buy The slaves were offered on the auction block one after another until they were all sold before their old master's face The first man offered on the block was an old gray headed slave by the name of Richard His wife followed him up to the block and when they had bid him up to seventy or eighty dollars one of the bidders asked Mr Young what he could do as he looked very old and infirm Mr Young replied by saying he is not able to accomplish much manual labor from his extreme age and hard labor in early life Yet I would rather have him than many of those who are young and vigorous who are able to perform twice as much labor because I know him to be faithful and trustworthy a Christian in good standing in my church I can trust him anywhere with confidence He has toiled many long years on my plantation and I have always found him faithful This giving him a good Christian character caused them to run him up to near two hundred dollars His poor old companion stood by weeping and pleading that they might not be separated But the marriage relation was soon dissolved by the sale and they were separated never to meet again Another man was called up whose wife followed him with her infant in her arms beseeching to be sold with her husband which proved to be all in Illustration Illustration vain After the men were all sold they then sold the women and children They ordered the first woman to lay down her child and mount the auction block she refused to give up her little one and clung to it as long as she could while the cruel lash was applied to her back for disobedience She pleaded for mercy in the name of God But the child was torn from the arms of its mother amid the most heart rending shrieks from the mother and child on the one hand and bitter oaths and cruel lashes from the tyrants on the other Finally the poor little child was torn from the mother while she was sacrificed to the highest bidder In this way the sale was carried on from begining to end There was each speculator with his hand cuffs to bind his victims after the sale and while they were doing their writings the Christian portion of the slaves asked permission to kneel in prayer on the ground before they separated which was granted And while bathing each other with tears of sorrow on the verge of their final separation their eloquent appeals in prayer to the Most High seemed to cause an unpleasant sensation upon the ears of their tyrants who ordered them to rise and make ready their limbs for the caffles And as they happened not to bound at the first sound they were soon raised from their knees by the sound of the lash and the rattle of the chains in which they were soon taken off by their respective masters husbands from wives and children from parents never expecting to meet until the judgment of the great day Then Christ shall say to the slaveholding professors of religion Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these little ones my brethren ye did it unto me Having thus tried to show the best side of slavery that I can conceive of the reader can exercise his own judgment in deciding whether a man can be a Bible Christian and yet hold his Christian brethren as property so that they may be sold at any time in market as sheep or oxen to pay his debts During my life in slavery I have been sold by professors of religion several times In Bro Albert G Sibley of Bedford Kentucky sold me for to Bro John Sibley and in the same year he sold me to Bro Wm Gatewood of Bedford for In Bro Gatewood sold me to Madison Garrison a slave trader of Louisville Kentucky with my wife and child at a depreciated price because I was a runaway In the same year he sold me with my family to Bro Whitfield in the city of New Orleans for in Bro Whitfield sold me from my family to Thomas Wilson and Co blacklegs In the same Tear they sold me to a Bro in the Indian Territory I think he was a member of the Presbyterian Church F E Whitfield was a deacon in regular standing in the Baptist Church A Sibley was a Methodist exhorter of the M E Church in good standing J Sibley was a class leader in the same church and Wm Gatewood was also an acceptable member of the same church Is this Christianity Is it honest or right Is it doing as we would be done by Is it in accordance with the principles of humanity or justice I believe slaveholding to be a sin against God and man under all circumstances I have no sympathy with the person or persons who tolerate and support the system willingly and knowingly morally religiously or politically Prayerfully and earnestly relying on the power of truth and the aid of the divine providence I trust that this little volume will bear some humble part in lighting up the path of freedom and revolutionizing public opinion upon this great subject And I here pledge myself God being my helper ever to contend for the natural equality of the human family without regard to color which is but fading matter while mind makes the man NEW YORK CITY May HENRY BIBB OPINIONS OF THE PRESS From the many favorable notices of the Press which this volume has received the following have been selected From the New York Evangelist It will be difficult for any reader however suspicious of narratives of this kind to resist the conviction which the simplicity candor and good feeling of this work produces of its entire truthfulness And if true what a history it depicts Such oppression fear and suffering such courage and energy such meek endurance and perseverance could only be exemplified by one whose nature was taxed to the uttermost The hardest task the reader will find is to suppress his indignation and to keep the balance of his judgment in reference to a system which can possibly lead to such monstrous results We wish the book might obtain a universal perusal It is adapted to produce the right kind of feeling a feeling of deep and abiding sympathy for the oppressed We are all too indifferent to the wrongs of the slave We do not make his case our own We do not feel for those in bonds as bound with them There is a lamentable lack of proper Christian sympathy and it is one of the best results of a book like this that it quickens the flow of feeling and touches the heart Mr Bibb has manifested by a blameless life and by extraordinary talents a character which not only corroborates the truth of his history but powerfully illustrates the terrible nature of the system whose oppressions he here records For his sake as well as for the sake of humanity and freedom we hope an extensive sale awaits the little volume It is small neatly printed and sold at a low price from fifty cents to seventy five cents per copy Let there be a little Christian generosity exhibited in the sale of the work From the Liberator Henry Bibb the well known fugitive slave has just published in elegant style and with sundry pictorial illustrations a Narrative of his Life and Adventures written by himself and remarkably well written too with an Introduction by Lucius C Matlac Of all the narratives that have been published no one exceeds this in thrilling interest and of all the subjects of them no one appears to have seen and suffered so much as Mr Bibb It is a book for the rising generation in particular and we could wish that as many copies of it might be sold during the present year as there are slaves in the United States From the True Wesleyan This is a volume of s handsomely printed on good paper and well bound But it is not in the execution that the interest lies it is in the thrilling incidents so well told We have never been a great reader of novels as all must know by our style of writing yet we have read enough to know the almost resistless power which a well executed tale when once we commence reading exerts over the mind until we reach the end and did we not know the author and know from the best of proof that the book is a true narrative on reading it we should pronounce it a novel The reader may rely upon its truth and yet he will find it so full of touching incidents daring adventures and hair breadth escapes that he will find his attention held spell bound from the time he begins until he has finished the little volume We think the work cannot fail to meet with an extensive sale From the New York Tribune This is a Narrative of intense interest The author is well known as a powerful speaker keen in debate shrewd in argument and dangerous in retort He here shows an equally ready command of the pen and has produced a book which would do credit to a practiced writer No stronger proof of the absurdity of slavery can be demanded than this little history By appealing to the sense of justice and the feeling of sympathy in this artless record of a noble struggle with oppression and outrage Mr Bibb will make an impression on many readers who would not be reached by more elaborate statements His book has the attraction of a romance though there was no romance in his sufferings They were matter of fact realities of the sternest kind From the North Star After waiting several weeks we have received a copy of this little work It is certainly one of the most interesting and thrilling narratives of slavery ever laid before the American people The exposure which the author makes of the horrors of slavery the separations the whippings and the accumulated outrages inflicted on the slave must stir the blood of every reader who has the pulsations of a man The description of the slave's longing for freedom of his deception tricks and stratagems to escape his condition is just though humiliating His narrations of the cruelty of individual slaveholders is natural and we doubt not in every essential particular is true We deem the work a most valuable acquisition to the anti slavery cause and we hope that it may be widely circulated through out the country From the Chronotype This fugitive slave literature is destined to be a powerful lever We have the most profound conviction of its potency We see in it the easy and infallible means of abolitionizing the free states Argument provokes argument reason is met by sophistry But narratives of slaves go right to the hearts of men We defy any man to think with any patience or tolerance of slavery after reading Bibb's narrative unless he is one of those infidels to nature who float on the race as monsters from it but not of it Put a dozen copies of this book into every school district or neighborhood in the Free States and we have known candidates of the Free Soil party whose wealth would not miss the requisite to do it and you might sweep the whole north on a thorough going Liberty Platform for abolishing slavery everywhere and every how Stir up honest men's souls with such a book and they won't set much by disclaimers they won't be squeamish how radically they vote against a system which surpasses any hell which theology has ever been able to conjure up We believe this to be an unvarnished tale giving a true picture of slavery in all its features good bad and indifferent if it has so many The book is written with perfect artlessness and the man who can read it unmoved must be fit for treasons stratagems and spoils One conclusion forced upon the philosophical reader of such narratives of runaway slaves is this that however tolerable chattel slavery may be as an institution for savage and barbarous life when you bring it into the purlieus of civilization and Christianity it becomes unspeakably iniquitous and intolerable If Mr Calhoun really means to upheld slavery he must there is no help for it abolish Christianity printing art science and take his patriarchs back to the standard of Central Africa or the days of Shem Ham and Japhet

gains his fortune from the blood of souls Cowper ELEVENTH THOUSAND LONDON CHARLES GILPIN BISHOPGATE ST WITHOUT Printed chiefly from the American Stereotype Plates by Webb and Chapman Great Brunswick street Dublin i TO WELLS BROWN OF OHIO THIRTEEN years ago I came to your door a weary fugitive from chains and stripes I was a stranger and you took me in I was hungry and you fed me Naked was I and you clothed me Even a name by which to be known among men slavery had denied me You bestowed upon me your own Base indeed should I be if I ever forget what I owe to you or do anything to disgrace that honored name As a slight testimony of my gratitude to my earliest benefactor I take the liberty to inscribe to you this little narrative of the sufferings from which I was fleeing when you had compassion upon me In the multitude that you have succored it is very possible that you may not remember me but until I forget God and myself I can never forget you Your grateful friend WILLIAM WELLS BROWN ii FLING OUT THE ANTI SLAVERY FLAG BY W W BROWN FLING out the Anti Slavery flag On every swelling breeze And let its folds wave o'er the land And o'er the raging seas Till all beneath the standard sheet With new allegiance bow And pledge themselves to onward bear The emblem of their vow Fling out the Anti Slavery flag And let it onward wave Till it shall float o'er every clime And liberate the slave Till like a meteor flashing far It bursts with glorious light And with its heaven born rays dispels The gloom of sorrow's night Fling out the Anti Slavery flag And let it not be furled Till like a planet of the skies It sweeps around the world And when each poor degraded slave Is gathered near and far O fix it on the azure arch As hope's eternal star Fling out the Anti Slavery flag Forever let it be The emblem to a holy cause The banner of the free And never from its guardian height Let it by man be driven But let it float forever there Beneath the smiles of heaven iii NOTE TO THE FOURTH AMERICAN EDITION Three editions of this work consisting in all of eight thousand copies were sold in less than eighteen months from the time the first edition was published No antislavery work has met with a more rapid sale in the United States than this narrative The present edition is published to meet the demand now existing for the work THE PUBLISHER NOTE TO THE PRESENT EDITION THE present Narrative was first published in Boston U S in July and eight thousand copies were sold in less than eighteen months from the time of its publication This rapid sale may be attributed to the circumstance that for three years preceding its publication I had been employed as a lecturing agent by the American Anti slavery Society and I was thus very generally known throughout the Free States of the Great Republic as one who had spent the first twenty years of his life as a slave in her southern house of bondage In visiting Great Britain I had two objects in view Firstly I have been chosen as a delegate by the American Peace Committee for a Congress of Nations to attend the Peace Convention to be held in Paris during the last week of the present month August Many of the most distinguished American Abolitionists considered it a triumphant evidence of the progress of their principles that one of the oppressed coloured race one who is even now by the constitution of the United States a slave should have been selected for this honourable office and were therefore very desirous that I should attend Secondly I wished to follow up the work of my friends and fellow labourers Charles Lenox Remond and Frederick Douglas and to lay before the people of Great Britain and Ireland the wrongs that are still committed iv upon the slaves and the free coloured people of America The rapid increase of communication between the two sides of the Atlantic has brought them so close together that the personal intercourse between the British people and American slaveowners is now very great and the slaveholder crafty and politic as deliberate tyrants generally are rarely leaves the shores of Europe without attempting at least to assuage the prevalent hostility against his beloved peculiar institution The influence of the Southern States of America is mainly directed to the maintenance and propagation of the system of slavery in their own and in other countries In the pursuit of this object every consideration of religion liberty national strength and social order is made to give way and hitherto they have been very successful The actual number of the slaveholders is small but their union is complete so that they form a dominant oligarchy in the United States It is my desire in common with every abolitionist to diminish their influence and this can only be effected by the promulgation of truth and the cultivation of a correct public sentiment at home and abroad Slavery cannot be let alone It is aggressive and must either be succumbed to or put down It has been suggested that my narrative is somewhat deficient in dates From my total want of education previous to my escape from slavery I am unable to give them with much accuracy The ignorance of the American slaves is with rare exceptions intense and the slaveholders generally do their utmost to perpetuate this mental darkness The perpetuation of slavery depends upon it Whatever may be said of the physical condition of the slaves it is undeniable that if they were not kept in a state of intellectual religious and moral degradation they could be retained as slaves no longer In conclusion I ask the attention of the reader to the Resolutions of the coloured citizens of Boston and to the other documents in reference to myself which will be found at the end of the book Of the latter two are from the pen of WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON that faithful and indefatigable friend of the oppressed whose position as the Pioneer of the anti slavery movement has secured to him more than to any other American abolitionist the gratitude of the coloured race and a world wide reputation WILLIAM WELLS BROWN Great Brunswick street Dublin August th v LETTER from EDMUND QUINCY ESQ DEDHAM JULY To WILLIAM W BROWN MY DEAR FRIEND I heartily thank you for the privilege of reading the manuscript of your Narrative I have read it with deep interest and strong emotion I am much mistaken if it be not greatly successful and eminently useful It presents a different phase of the infernal slave system from that portrayed in the admirable story of Mr Douglass and gives us a glimpse of its hideous cruelties in other portions of its domain Your opportunities of observing the workings of this accursed system have been singularly great Your experiences in the Field in the House and especially on the River in the service of the slave trader Walker have been such as few individuals have had no one certainly who has been competent to describe them What I have admired and marvelled at in your Narrative is the simplicity and calmness with which you describe scenes and actions which might well move the very vi stones to rise and mutiny against the National Institution which makes them possible You will perceive that I have made very sparing use of your flattering permission to alter what you had written To correct a few errors which appeared to be merely clerical ones committed in the hurry of composition under unfavorable circumstances and to suggest a few curtailments is all that I have ventured to do I should be a bold man as well as a vain one if I should attempt to improve your descriptions of what you have seen and suffered Some of the scenes are not unworthy of De Foe himself I trust and believe that your Narrative will have a wide circulation I am sure it deserves it At least a man must be differently constituted from me who can rise from the perusal of your Narrative without feeling that he understands slavery better and hates it worse than he ever did before I am very faithfully and respectfully Your friend EDMUND QUINCY vii PREFACE WHEN I first published this Narrative the public had no evidence whatever that I had been a slave except my own story As soon as the work came from the press I sent several copies to slaveholders residing at the South with whom I was acquainted and among others one to Mr Enoch Price the man who claims my body and soul as his property and from whom I had run away A few weeks after the Narrative was sent Edmund Quincy Esq received the following letter from Mr Price It tells its own story and forever settles the question of my having been a slave Here is the letter ST LOUIS Jan th SIR I received a pamphlet or a Narrative so called on the title of the Life of William W Brown a fugitive slave purporting to have been written by himself and in his book I see a letter from you to said William W Brown This said Brown is named Sanford he is a slave belonging to me and ran away from me the first day of January Now I see many things in his book that are not true and a part of viii it as near true as a man could recollect after so long a time I purchased him of Mr S Willi the last of September I paid six hundred and fifty dollars for him If I had wanted to speculate on him I could have sold him for three times as much as I paid for him I was offered two thousand dollars for him in New Orleans at one time and fifteen hundred dollars for him at another time in Louisville Kentucky But I would not sell him I was told that he was going to run away the day before he ran away but I did not believe the man for I had so much confidence in Sanford I want you to see him and see if what I say is not the truth I do not want him as a slave but I think that his friends who sustain him and give him the right hand of fellowship or he himself could afford to pay my agent in Boston three hundred and twenty five dollars and I will give him free papers so that he may go wherever he wishes to Then he can visit St Louis or any other place he may wish This amount is just half that I paid for him Now if this offer suits Mr Brown and the Anti Slavery Society of Boston or Massachusetts let me know and I will give you the name of my agent in Boston and forward the papers to be given to William W Brown as soon as the money is paid Yours respectfully E PRICE TO EDMUND QUINCY Esq Mr Price says that he sees many things in my book which are not true and a part of it as near true as a man could recollect after so long a time As I was with Mr Price only three months and have devoted only six s to him and his family he can know but little about my narrative except that ix part which speaks of him But I am willing to avail myself of his testimony for he says that a part of it is true But I cannot accept of Mr Price's offer to become a purchaser of my body and soul God made me as free as he did Enoch Price and Mr Price shall never receive a dollar from me or my friends with my consent Boston October W W BROWN The author caught by the bloodhounds See p NARRATIVE I I was born in Lexington Ky The man who stole me as soon as I was born recorded the births of all the infants which he claimed to be born his property in a book which he kept for that purpose My mother's name was Elizabeth She had seven children viz Solomon Leander Benjamin Joseph Millford Elizabeth and myself No two of us were children of the same father My father's name as I learned from my mother was George Higgins He was a white man a relative of my master and connected with some of the first families in Kentucky My master owned about forty slaves twenty five of whom were field hands He removed from Kentucky to Missouri when I was quite young and settled thirty or forty miles above St Charles on the Missouri where in addition to his practice as a physician he carried on milling merchandizing and farming He had a large farm the principal productions of which were tobacco and hemp The slave cabins were situated on the back part of the farm with the house of the overseer whose name was Grove Cook in their midst He had the entire charge of the farm and having no family was allowed a woman to keep house for him whose business it was to deal out the provisions for the hands A woman was also kept at the quarters to do the cooking for the field hands who were summoned to their unrequited toil every morning at four o'clock by the ringing of a bell hung on a post near the house of the overseer They were allowed half an hour to eat their breakfast and get to the field At half past four a horn was blown by the overseer which was the signal to commence work and every one that was not on the spot at the time had to receive ten lashes from the negro whip with which the overseer always went armed The handle was about three feet long with the butt end filled with lead and the lash six or seven feet in length made of cow hide with platted wire on the end of it This whip was put in requisition very frequently and freely and a small offence on the part of a slave furnished an occasion for its use During the time that Mr Cook was overseer I was a house servant a situation preferable to that of a field hand as I was better fed better clothed and not obliged to rise at the ringing of the bell but about half an hour after I have often laid and heard the crack of the whip and the screams of the slave My mother was a field hand and one morning was ten or fifteen minutes behind the others in getting into the field As soon as she reached the spot where they were at work the overseer commenced whipping her She cried Oh pray Oh pray Oh pray these are generally the words of slaves when imploring mercy at the hands of their oppressors I heard her voice and knew it and jumped out of my bunk and went to the door Though the field was some distance from the house I could hear every crack of the whip and every groan and cry of my poor mother I remained at the door not daring to venture any further The cold chills ran over me and I wept aloud After giving her ten lashes the sound of the whip ceased and I returned to my bed and found no consolation but in my tears Experience has taught me that nothing can be more heart rending than for one to see a dear and beloved mother or sister tortured and to hear their cries and not be able to render them assistance But such is the position which an American slave occupies My master being a politician soon found those who were ready to put him into office for the favors he could render them and a few years after his arrival in Missouri he was elected to a seat in the legislature In his absence from home everything was left in charge of Mr Cook the overseer and he soon became more tyrannical and cruel Among the slaves on the plantation was one by the name of Randall He was a man about six feet high and well proportioned and known as a man of great strength and power He was considered the most valuable and able bodied slave on the plantation but no matter how good or useful a slave may be he seldom escapes the lash But it was not so with Randall He had been on the plantation since my earliest recollection and I had never known of his being flogged No thanks were due to the master or overseer for this I have often heard him declare that no white man should ever whip him that he would die first Cook from the time that he came upon the plantation had frequently declared that he could and would flog any nigger that was put into the field to work under him My master had repeatedly told him not to attempt to whip Randall but he was determined to try it As soon as he was left sole dictator he thought the time had come to put his threats into execution He soon began to find fault with Randall and threatened to whip him if he did not do better One day he gave him a very hard task more than he could possibly do and at night the task not being performed he told Randall that he should remember him the next morning On the following morning after the hands had taken breakfast Cook called out to Randall and told him that he intended to whip him and ordered him to cross his hands and be tied Randall asked why he wished to whip him He answered because he had not finished his task the day before Randall said that the task was too great or he should have done it Cook said it made no difference he should whip him Randall stood silent for a moment and then said Mr Cook I have always tried to please you since you have been on the plantation and I find you are determined not to be satisfied with my work let me do as well as I may No man has laid hands on me to whip me for the last ten years and I have long since come to the conclusion not to be whipped by any man living Cook finding by Randall's determined look and gestures that he would resist called three of the hands from their work and commanded them to seize Randall and tie him The hands stood still they knew Randall and they also knew him to be a powerful man and were afraid to grapple with him As soon as Cook had ordered the men to seize him Randall turned to them and said Boys you all know me you know that I can handle any three of you and the man that lays hands on me shall die This white man can't whip me himself and therefore he has called you to help him The overseer was unable to prevail upon them to seize and secure Randall and finally ordered them all to go to their work together Nothing was said to Randall by the overseer for more than a week One morning however while the hands were at work in the field he came into it accompanied by three friends of his Thompson Woodbridge and Jones They came up to where Randall was at work and Cook ordered him to leave his work and go with them to the barn He refused to go whereupon he was attacked by the overseer and his companions when he turned upon them and laid them one after another prostrate on the ground Woodbridge drew out his pistol and fired at him and brought him to the ground by a pistol ball The others rushed upon him with their clubs and beat him over the head and face until they succeeded in tying him He was then taken to the barn and tied to a beam Cook gave him over one hundred lashes with a heavy cow hide had him washed with salt and water and left him tied during the day The next day he was untied and taken to a blacksmith's shop and had a ball and chain attached to his leg He was compelled to labor in the field and perform the same amount of work that the other hands did When his master returned home he was much pleased to find that Randall had been subdued in his absence II Soon afterwards my master removed to the city of St Louis and purchased a farm four miles from there which he placed under the charge of an overseer by the name of Friend Haskell He was a regular Yankee from New England The Yankees are noted for making the most cruel overseers My mother was hired out in the city and I was also hired out there to Major Freeland who kept a public house He was formerly from Virginia and was a horse racer cock fighter gambler and withal an inveterate drunkard There were ten or twelve servants in the house and when he was present it was cut and slash knock down and drag out In his fits of anger he would take up a chair and throw it at a servant and in his more rational moments when he wished to chastise one he would tie them up in the smoke house and whip them after which he would cause a fire to be made of tobacco stems and smoke them This he called Virginia play I complained to my master of the treatment which I received from Major Freeland but it made no difference He cared nothing about it so long as he received the money for my labor After living with Major Freeland five or six months I ran away and went into the woods back of the city and when night came on I made my way to my master's farm but was afraid to be seen knowing that if Mr Haskell the overseer should discover me I should be again carried back to Major Freeland so I kept in the woods One day while in the woods I heard the barking and howling of dogs and in a short time they came so near that I knew them to be the bloodhounds of Major Benjamin O'Fallon He kept five or six to hunt runaway slaves with As soon as I was convinced that it was them I knew there was no chance of escape I took refuge in the top of a tree and the hounds were soon at its base and there remained until the hunters came up in a half or three quarters of an hour afterwards There were two men with the dogs who as soon as they came up ordered me to descend I came down was tied and taken to St Louis jail Major Freeland soon made his appearance and took me out and ordered me to follow him which I did After we returned home I was tied up in the smoke house and was very severely whipped After the major had flogged me to his satisfaction he sent out his son Robert a young man eighteen or twenty years of age to see that I was well smoked He made a fire of tobacco stems which soon set me to coughing and sneezing This Robert told me was the way his father used to do to his slaves in Virginia After giving me what they conceived to be a decent smoking I was untied and again set to work Robert Freeland was a chip of the old block Though quite young it was not unfrequently that he came home in a state of intoxication He is now I believe a popular commander of a steam boat on the Mississippi river Major Freeland soon after failed in business and I was put on board the steamboat Missouri which plied between St Louis and Galena The commander of the boat was William B Culver I remained on her during the sailing season which was the most pleasant time for me that I had ever experienced At the close of navigation I was hired to Mr John Colburn keeper of the Missouri Hotel He was from one of the free states but a more inveterate hater of the negro I do not believe ever walked God's green earth This hotel was at that time one of the largest in the city and there were employed in it twenty or thirty servants mostly slaves Mr Colburn was very abusive not only to the servants but to his wife also who was an excellent woman and one from whom I never knew a servant to receive a harsh word but never did I know a kind one to a servant from her husband Among the slaves employed in the hotel was one by the name of Aaron who belonged to Mr John F Darby a lawyer Aaron was the knife cleaner One day one of the knives was put on the table not as clean as it might have been Mr Colburn for this offence tied Aaron up in the wood house and gave him over fifty lashes on the bare back with a cow hide after which he made me wash him down with rum This seemed to put him into more agony than the whipping After being untied he went home to his master and complained of the treatment which he had received Mr Darby would give no heed to anything he had to say but sent him directly back Colburn learning that he had been to his master with complaints tied him up again and gave him a more severe whipping than before The poor fellow's back was literally cut to pieces so much so that he was not able to work for ten or twelve days There was also among the servants a girl whose master resided in the country Her name was Patsey Mr Colburn tied her up one evening and whipped her until several of the boarders came out and begged him to desist The reason for whipping her was this She was engaged to be married to a man belonging to Major William Christy who resided four or five miles north of the city Mr Colburn had forbid her to see John Christy The reason of this was said to be the regard which he himself had for Patsey She went to meeting that evening and John returned home with her Mr Colburn had intended to flog John if he came within the inclosure but John knew too well the temper of his rival and kept at a safe distance so he took vengeance on the poor girl If all the slave drivers had been called together I do not think a more cruel man than John Colburn and he too a northern man could have been found among them While living at the Missouri hotel a circumstance occurred which caused me great unhappiness My master sold my mother and all her children except myself They were sold to different persons in the city of St Louis III I WAS soon after taken from Mr Colburn's and hired to Elijah P Lovejoy who was at that time publisher and editor of the St Louis Times My work while with him was mainly in the printing office waiting on the hands working the press c Mr Lovejoy was a very good man and decidedly the best master that I had ever had I am chiefly indebted to him and to my employment in the printing office for what little learning I obtained while in slavery Though slavery is thought by some to be mild in Missouri when compared with the cotton sugar and rice growing states yet no part of our slave holding country is more noted for the barbarity of its inhabitants than St Louis It was here that Col Harney a United States officer whipped a slave woman to death It was here that Francis McIntosh a free colored man from Pittsburg was taken from the steamboat Flora and burned at the stake During a residence of eight years in this city numerous cases of extreme cruelty came under my own observation to record them all would occupy more space than could possibly be allowed in this little volume I shall therefore give but a few more in addition to what I have already related Capt J B Brant who resided near my master had a slave named John He was his body servant carriage driver c On one occasion while driving his master through the city the streets being very muddy and the horses going at a rapid rate some mud spattered upon a gentleman by the name of Robert More More was determined to be revenged Some three or four months after this occurrence he purchased John for the express purpose as he said to tame the d d nigger After the purchase he took him to a blacksmith's shop and had a ball and chain fastened to his leg and then put him to driving a yoke of oxen and kept him at hard labor until the iron around his leg was so worn into the flesh that it was thought mortification would ensue In addition to this John told me that his master whipped him regularly three times a week for the first two months and all this to tame him A more noble looking man than he was not to be found in all St Louis before he fell into the hands of More and a more degraded and spirit crushed looking being was never seen on a southern plantation after he had been subjected to this taming process for three months The last time that I saw him he had nearly lost the entire use of his limbs While living with Mr Lovejoy I was often sent on errands to the office of the Missouri Republican published by Mr Edward Charless Once while returning to the office with type I was attacked by several large boys sons of slave holders who pelted me with snow balls Having the heavy form of type in my hands I could not make my escape by running so I laid down the type and gave them battle They gathered around me pelting me with stones and sticks until they overpowered me and would have captured me if I had not resorted to my heels Upon my retreat they took possession of the type and what to do to regain it I could not devise Knowing Mr Lovejoy to be a very humane man I went to the office and laid the case before him He told me to remain in the office He took one of the apprentices with him and went after the type and soon returned with it but on his return informed me that Samuel McKinney had told him he would whip me because I had hurt his boy Soon after McKinney was seen making his way to the office by one of the printers who informed me of the fact and I made my escape through the back door McKinney not being able to find me on his arrival left the office in a great rage swearing that he would whip me to death A few days after as I was walking along Main street he seized me by the collar and struck me over the head five or six times with a large cane which caused the blood to gush from my nose and ears in such a manner that my clothes were completely saturated with blood After beating me to his satisfaction he let me go and I returned to the office so weak from the loss of blood that Mr Lovejoy sent me home to my master It was five weeks before I was able to walk again During this time it was necessary to have some one to supply my place at the office and I lost the situation After my recovery I was hired to Capt Otis Reynolds as a waiter on board the steamboat Enterprise owned by Messrs John and Edward Walsh commission merchants at St Louis This boat was then running on the upper Mississippi My employment on board was to wait on gentlemen and the captain being a good man the situation was a pleasant one to me but in passing from place to place and seeing new faces every day and knowing that they could go where they pleased I soon became unhappy and several times thought of leaving the boat at some landing place and trying to make my escape to Canada which I had heard much about as a place where the slave might live be free and be protected But whenever such thoughts would come into my mind my resolution would soon be shaken by the remembrance that my dear mother was a slave in St Louis and I could not bear the idea of leaving her in that condition She had often taken me upon her knee and told me how she had carried me upon her back to the field when I was an infant how often she had been whipped for leaving her work to nurse me and how happy I would appear when she would take me into her arms When these thoughts came over me I would resolve never to leave the land of slavery without my mother I thought that to leave her in slavery after she had undergone and suffered so much for me would be proving recreant to the duty which I owed to her Besides this I had three brothers and a sister there two of my brothers having died My mother my brothers Joseph and Millford and my sister Elizabeth belonged to Mr Isaac Mansfield formerly from one of the free states Massachusetts I believe He was a tinner by trade and carried on a large manufacturing establishment Of all my relatives mother was first and sister next One evening while visiting them I made some allusion to a proposed journey to Canada and sister took her seat by my side and taking my hand in hers said with tears in her eyes Brother you are not going to leave mother and your dear sister here without a friend are you I looked into her face as the tears coursed swiftly down her cheeks and bursting into tears myself said No I will never desert you and mother She clasped my hand in hers and said Brother you have often declared that you would not end your days in slavery I see no possible way in which you can escape with us and now brother you are on a steamboat where there is some chance for you to escape to a land of liberty I beseech you not to let us hinder you If we cannot get our liberty we do not wish to be the means of keeping you from a land of freedom I could restrain my feelings no longer and an outburst of my own feelings caused her to cease speaking upon that subject In opposition to their wishes I pledged myself not to leave them in the hand of the oppressor I took leave of them and returned to the boat and laid down in my bunk but sleep departed from mine eyes and slumber from mine eyelids A few weeks after on our downward passage the boat took on board at Hannibal a drove of slaves bound for the New Orleans market They numbered from fifty to sixty consisting of men and women from eighteen to forty years of age A drove of slaves on a southern steamboat bound for the cotton or sugar regions is an occurrence so common that no one not even the passengers appear to notice it though they clank their chains at every step There was however one in this gang that attracted the attention of the passengers and crew It was a beautiful girl apparently about twenty years of age perfectly white with straight light hair and blue eyes But it was not the whiteness of her skin that created such a sensation among those who gazed upon her it was her almost unparalleled beauty She had been on the boat but a short time before the attention of all the passengers including the ladies had been called to her and the common topic of conversation was about the beautiful slave girl She was not in chains The man who claimed this article of human merchandise was a Mr Walker a well known slave trader residing in St Louis There was a general anxiety among the passengers and crew to learn the history of the girl Her master kept close by her side and it would have been considered impudent for any of the passengers to have spoken to her and the crew were not allowed to have any conversation with them When we reached St Louis the slaves were removed to a boat bound for New Orleans and the history of the beautiful slave girl remained a mystery I remained on the boat during the season and it was not an unfrequent occurrence to have on board gangs of slaves on their way to the cotton sugar and rice plantations of the south Toward the latter part of the summer Captain Reynolds left the boat and I was sent home I was then placed on the farm under Mr Haskell the overseer As I had been some time out of the field and not accustomed to work in the burning sun it was very hard but I was compelled to keep up with the best of the hands I found a great difference between the work in a steamboat cabin and that in a corn field My master who was then living in the city soon after removed to the farm when I was taken out of the field to work in the house as a waiter Though his wife was very peevish and hard to please I much preferred to be under her control than the overseer's They brought with them Mr Sloane a Presbyterian minister Miss Martha Tulley a niece of theirs from Kentucky and their nephew William The latter had been in the family a number of years but the others were all new comers Mr Sloane was a young minister who had been at the South but a short time and it seemed as if his whole aim was to please the slaveholders especially my master and mistress He was intending to make a visit during the winter and he not only tried to please them but I think he succeeded admirably When they wanted singing he sung when they wanted praying he prayed when they wanted a story told he told a story Instead of his teaching my master theology my master taught theology to him While I was with Captain Reynolds my master got religion and new laws were made on the plantation Formerly we had the privilege of hunting fishing making splint brooms baskets c on Sunday but this was all stopped Every Sunday we were all compelled to attend meeting Master was so religious that he induced some others to join him in hiring preacher to preach to the slaves IV MY master had family worship night and morning At night the slaves were called in to attend but in the mornings they had to be at their work and master did all the praying My master and mistress were great lovers of mint julep and every morning a pitcher full was made of which they all partook freely not excepting little master William After drinking freely all round they would have family worship and then breakfast I cannot say but I loved the julep as well as any of them and during prayer was always careful to seat myself close to the table where it stood so as to help myself when they were all busily engaged in their devotions By the time prayer was over I was about as happy as any of them A sad accident happened one morning In helping myself and at at the same time keeping an eye on my old mistress I accidentally let the pitcher fall upon the floor breaking it in pieces and spilling the contents This was a bad affair for me for as soon as prayer was over I was taken and severely chastised My master's family consisted of himself his wife and their nephew William Moore He was taken into the family when only a few weeks of age His name being that of my own mine was changed for the purpose of giving precedence to his though I was his senior by ten or twelve years The plantation being four miles from the city I had to drive the family to church I always dreaded the approach of the Sabbath for during service I was obliged to stand by the horses in the hot broiling sun or in the rain just as it happened One Sabbath as we were driving past the house of D D a gentleman who owned a large baking establishment as I was sitting upon the box of the carriage which was very much elevated I saw Mr pursuing a slave around the yard with a long whip cutting him at every jump The man soon escaped from the yard and was followed by Mr They came running past us and the slave perceiving that he would be overtaken stopped suddenly and stumbled over him and falling on the stone pavement fractured one of his legs which crippled him for life The same gentleman but a short time previous tied up a woman of his by the name of Delphia and whipped her nearly to death yet he was a deacon in the Baptist church in good and regular standing Poor Delphia I was well acquainted with her and called to see her while upon her sick bed and I shall never forget her appearance She was a member of the same church with her master Soon after this I was hired out to Mr Walker the same man whom I have mentioned as having carried a gang of slaves down the river on the steamboat Enterprise Seeing me in the capacity of a steward on the boat and thinking that I would make a good hand to take care of slaves he determined to have me for that purpose and finding that my master would not sell me he hired me for the term of one year When I learned the fact of my having been hired to a negro speculator or a soul driver as they are generally called among slaves no one can tell my emotions Mr Walker had offered a high price for me as I afterwards learned but I suppose my master was restrained from selling me by the fact that I was a near relative of his On entering the service of Mr Walker I found that my opportunity of getting to a land of liberty was gone at least for the time being He had a gang of slaves in readiness to start for New Orleans and in a few days we were on our journey I am at a loss for language to express my feelings on that occasion Although my master had told me that he had not sold me and Mr Walker had told me that he had not purchased me I did not believe them and not until I had been to New Orleans and was on my return did I believe that I was not sold There was on the boat a large room on the lower deck in which the slaves were kept men and women promiscuously all chained two and two and a strict watch kept that they did not get loose for cases have occurred in which slaves have got off their chains and made their escape at landing places while the boats were taking in wood and with all our care we lost one woman who had been taken from her husband and children and having no desire to live without them in the agony of her soul jumped overboard and drowned herself She was not chained It was almost impossible to keep that part of the boat clean On landing at Natchez the slaves were all carried to the slave pen and there kept one week during which time several of them were sold Mr Walker fed his slaves well We took on board at St Louis several hundred pounds of bacon smoked meat and corn meal and his slaves were better fed than slaves generally were in Natchez so far as my observation extended At the end of a week we left for New Orleans the place of our final destination which we reached in two days Here the slaves were placed in a negro pen where those who wished to purchase could call and examine them The negro pen is a small yard surrounded by buildings from fifteen to twenty feet wide with the exception of a large gate with iron bars The slaves are kept in the buildings during the night and turned out into the yard during the day After the best of the stock was sold at private sale at the pen the balance were taken to the Exchange Coffee House Auction Rooms kept by Isaac L McCoy and sold at public auction After the sale of this lot of slaves we left New Orleans for St Louis V ON our arrival at St Louis I went to Dr Young and told him that I did not wish to live with Mr Walker any longer I was heart sick at seeing my fellow creatures bought and sold But the Dr had hired me for the year and stay I must Mr Walker again commenced purchasing another gang of slaves He bought a man of Colonel John O'Fallon who resided in the suburbs of the city This man had a wife and three children As soon as the purchase was made he was put in jail for safe keeping until we should be ready to start for New Orleans His wife visited him while there several times and several times when she went for that purpose was refused admittance In the course of eight or nine weeks Mr Walker had his cargo of human flesh made up There was in this lot a number of old men and women some of them with gray locks We left St Louis in the steamboat Carlton Captain Swan bound for New Orleans On our way down and before we reached Rodney the place where we made our first stop I had to prepare the old slaves for market I was ordered to have the old men's whiskers shaved off and the grey hairs plucked out where they were not too numerous in which case he had a preparation of blacking to color it and with a blacking brush we would put it on This was new business to me and was performed in a room where the passengers could not see us These slaves were also taught how old they were by Mr Walker and after going through the blacking process they looked ten or fifteen years younger and I am sure that some of those who purchased slaves of Mr Walker were dreadfully cheated especially in the ages of the slaves which they bought We landed at Rodney and the slaves were driven to the pen in the back part of the village Several were sold at this place during our stay of four or five days when we proceeded to Natchez There we landed at night and the gang were put in the warehouse until morning when they were driven to the pen As soon as the slaves are put in these pens swarms of planters may be seen in and about them They knew when Walker was expected as he always had the time advertised beforehand when he would be in Rodney Natchez and New Orleans These were the principal places where he offered his slaves for sale When at Natchez the second time I saw a slave very cruelly whipped He belonged to a Mr Broadwell a merchant who kept a store on the wharf The slave's name was Lewis I had known him several years as he was formerly from St Louis We were expecting a steamboat down the river in which we were to take passage for New Orleans Mr Walker sent me to the landing to watch for the boat ordering me to inform him on its arrival While there I went into the store to see Lewis I saw a slave in the store and asked him where Lewis was Said he They have got Lewis hanging between the heavens and the earth I asked him what he meant by that He told me to go into the warehouse and see I went in and found Lewis there He was tied up to a beam with his toes just touching the floor As there was no one in the warehouse but himself I inquired the reason of his being in that situation He said Mr Broadwell had sold his wife to a planter six miles from the city and that he had been to visit her that he went in the night expecting to return before daylight and went without his master's permission The patrol had taken him up before he reached his wife He was put in jail and his master had to pay for his catching and keeping and that was what he was tied up for Just as he finished his story Mr Broadwell came in and inquired what I was doing there I knew not what to say and while I was thinking what reply to make he struck me over the head with the cowhide the end of which struck me over my right eye sinking deep into the flesh leaving a scar which I carry to this day Before I visited Lewis he had received fifty lashes Mr Broadwell gave him fifty lashes more after I came out as I was afterwards informed by Lewis himself The next day we proceeded to New Orleans and put the gang in the same negro pen which we occupied before In a short time the planters came flocking to the pen to purchase slaves Before the slaves were exhibited for sale they were dressed and driven out into the yard Some were set to dancing some to jumping some to singing and some to playing cards This was done to make them appear cheerful and happy My business was to see that they were placed in those situations before the arrival of the purchasers and I have often set them to dancing when their cheeks were wet with tears As slaves were in good demand at that time they were all soon disposed of and we again set out for St Louis On our arrival Mr Walker purchased a farm five or six miles from the city He had no family but made a housekeeper of one of his female slaves Poor Cynthia I knew her well She was a quadroon and one of the most beautiful women I ever saw She was a native of St Lewis and bore an irreproachable character for virtue and propriety of conduct Mr Walker bought her for the New Orleans market and took her down with him on one of the trips that I made with him Never shall I forget the circumstances of that voyage On the first night that we were on board the steamboat he directed me to put her into a state room he had provided for her apart from the other slaves I had seen too much of the workings of slavery not to know what this meant I accordingly watched him into the state room and listened to hear what passed between them I heard him make his base offers and her reject them He told her that if she would accept his vile proposals he would take her back with him to St Louis and establish her as his housekeeper on his farm But if she persisted in rejecting them he would sell her as a field hand on the worst plantation on the river Neither threats nor bribes prevailed however and he retired disappointed of his prey The next morning poor Cynthia told me what had passed and bewailed her sad fate with floods of tears I comforted and encouraged her all I could but I foresaw but too well what the result must be Without entering into any further particulars suffice it to say that Walker performed his part of the contract at that time He took her back to St Louis established her as his mistress and housekeeper at his farm and before I left he had two children by her But mark the end Since I have been at the North I have been credibly informed that Walker has been married and as a previous measure sold poor Cynthia and her four children she having had two more since I came away into hopeless bondage He soon commenced purchasing to make up the third gang We took steamboat and went to Jefferson City a town on the Missouri river Here we landed and took stage for the interior of the state He bought a number of slaves as he passed the different farms and villages After getting twenty two or twenty three men and women we arrived at St Charles a village on the banks of the Missouri Here he purchased a woman who had a child in her arms appearing to be four or five weeks old We had been travelling by land for some days and were in hopes to have found a boat at this place for St Louis but were disappointed As no boat was expected for some days we started for St Louis by land Mr Walker had purchased two horses He rode one and I the other The slaves were chained together and we took up our line of march Mr Walker taking the lead and I bringing up the rear Though the distance was not more than twenty miles we did not reach it the first day The road was worse than any that I have ever travelled Soon after we left St Charles the young child grew very cross and kept up a noise during the greater part of the day Mr Walker complained of its crying several times and told the mother to stop the child's d d noise or he would The woman The slave trader Walker and the author driving a gang of slaves to the southern market tried to keep the child from crying but could not We put up at night with an acquaintance of Mr Walker and in the morning just as we were about to start the child again commenced crying Walker stepped up to her and told her to give the child to him The mother tremblingly obeyed He took the child by one arm as you would a cat by the leg walked into the house and said to the lady Madam I will make you a present of this little nigger it keeps such a noise that I can't bear it Thank you sir said the lady The mother as soon as she saw that her child was to be left ran up to Mr Walker and falling upon her knees begged him to let her have her child she clung around his legs and cried Oh my child my child master do let me have my child oh do do do I will stop its crying if you will only let me have it again When I saw this woman crying for her child so piteously a shudder a feeling akin to horror shot through my frame I have often since in imagination heard her crying for her child None but those who have been in a slave state and who have seen the American slave trader engaged in his nefarious traffic can estimate the sufferings their victims undergo If there is one feature of American slavery more abominable than another it is that which sanctions the buying and selling of human beings The African slave trade was abolished by the American Congress some twenty years since and now by the laws of the country if an American is found engaged in the African slave trade he is considered a pirate and if found guilty of such the penalty would be death Although the African slave trader has been branded as a pirate men are engaged in the traffic in slaves in this country who occupy high positions in society and hold offices of honor in the councils of the nation and not a few have made their fortunes by this business After the woman's child had been given away Mr Walker commanded her to return into the ranks with the other slaves Women who had children were not chained but those that had none were As soon as her child was disposed of she was chained in the gang The following song I have often heard the slaves sing when about to be carried to the far south It is said to have been composed by a slave See these poor souls from Africa Transported to America We are stolen and sold to Georgia Will you go along with me We are stolen and sold to Georgia Come sound the jubilee See wives and husbands sold apart Their children's screams will break my heart There 's a better day a coming Will you go along with me There 's a better day a coming Go sound the jubilee O gracious Lord when shall it be That we poor souls shall all be free Lord break them slavery powers Will you go along with me Lord break them slavery powers Go sound the jubilee Dear Lord dear Lord when slavery 'll cease Then we poor souls will have our peace There 's a better day a coming Will you go along with me There 's a better day a coming Go sound the jubilee We finally arrived at Mr Walker's farm He had a house built during our absence to put slaves in It was a kind of domestic jail The slaves were put in the jail at night and worked on the farm during the day They were kept here until the gang was completed when we again started for New Orleans on board the steamboat North America Capt Alexander Scott We had a large number of slaves in this gang One by the name of Joe Mr Walker was training up to take my place as my time was nearly out and glad was I We made our first stop at Vicksburg where we remained one week and sold several slaves Mr Walker though not a good master had not flogged a slave since I had been with him though he had threatened me The slaves were kept in the pen and he always put up at the best hotel and kept his wines in his room for the accommodation of those who called to negotiate with him for the purchase of slaves One day while we were at Vicksburg several gentlemen came to see him for that purpose and as usual the wine was called for I took the tray and started around with it and having accidentally filled some of the glasses too full the gentlemen spilled the wine on their clothes as they went to drink Mr Walker apologized to them for my carelessness but looked at me as though he would see me again on this subject After the gentlemen had left the room he asked me what I meant by my carelessness and said that he would attend to me The next morning he gave me a note to carry to the jailer and a dollar in money to give to him I suspected that all was not right so I went down near the landing where I met with a sailor and walking up to him asked him if he would be so kind as to read the note for me He read it over and then looked at me I asked him to tell me what was in it Said he They are going to give you hell Why said I He said This is a note to have you whipped and says that you have a dollar to pay for it He handed me back the note and off I started I knew not what to do but was determined not to be whipped I went up to the jail took a look at it and walked off again As Mr Walker was acquainted with the jailer I feared that I should be found out if I did not go and be treated in consequence of it still worse While I was meditating on the subject I saw a colored man about my size walk up and the thought struck me in a moment to send him with my note I walked up to him and asked him who he belonged to He said he was a free man and had been in the city but a short time I told him I had a note to go into the jail and get a trunk to carry to one of the steamboats but was so busily engaged that I could not do it although I had a dollar to pay for it He asked me if I would not give him the job I handed him the note and the dollar and off he started for the jail I watched to see that he went in and as soon as I saw the door close behind him I walked around the corner and took my station intending to see how my friend looked when he came out I had been there but a short time when a colored man came around the corner and said to another colored man with whom he was acquainted They are giving a nigger scissors in the jail What for said the other The man continued A nigger came into the jail and asked for the jailer The jailer came out and he handed him a note and said he wanted to get a trunk The jailer told him to go with him and he would give him the trunk So he took him into the room and told the nigger to give up the dollar He said a man had given him the dollar to pay for getting the trunk But that lie would not answer So they made him strip himself and then they tied him down and are now whipping him I stood by all the while listening to their talk and soon found out that the person alluded to was my customer I went into the street opposite the jail and concealed myself in such a manner that I could not be seen by any one coming out I had been there but a short time when the young man made his appearance and looked around for me I unobserved came forth from my hiding place behind a pile of brick and he pretty soon saw me and came up to me complaining bitterly saying that I had played a trick upon him I denied any knowledge of what the note contained and asked him what they had done to him He told me in substance what I heard the man tell who had come out of the jail Yes said he they whipped me and took my dollar and gave me this note He showed me the note which the jailer had given him telling him to give it to his master I told him I would give him fifty cents for it that being all the money I had He gave it to me and took his money He had received twenty lashes on his bare back with the negro whip I took the note and started for the hotel where I had left Mr Walker Upon reaching the hotel I handed it to a stranger whom I had not seen before and requested him to read it to me As near as I can recollect it was as follows DEAR SIR By your direction I have given your boy twenty lashes He is a very saucy boy and tried to make me believe that he did not belong to you and I put it on to him well for lying to me I remain Your obedient servant It is true that in most of the slave holding cities when a gentleman wishes his servants whipped he can send him to the jail and have it done Before I went in where Mr Walker was I wet my cheeks a little as though I had been crying He looked at me and inquired what was the matter I told him that I had never had such a whipping in my life and handed him the note He looked at it and laughed And so you told him that you did not belong to me Yes sir said I I did not know that there was any harm in that He told me I must behave myself if I did not want to be whipped again This incident shows how it is that slavery makes its victims lying and mean for which vices it afterwards reproaches them and uses them as arguments to prove that they deserve no better fate Had I entertained the same views of right and wrong which I now do I am sure I should never have practised the deception upon that poor fellow which I did I know of no act committed by me while in slavery which I have regretted more than that and I heartily desire that it may be at some time or other in my power to make him amends for his vicarious sufferings in my behalf VI IN a few days we reached New Orleans and arriving there in the night remained on board until morning While at New Orleans this time I saw a slave killed an account of which has been published by Theodore D Weld in his book entitled Slavery as it is The circumstances were as follows In the evening between seven and eight o'clock a slave came running down the levee followed by several men and boys The whites were crying out Stop that nigger stop that nigger while the poor panting slave in almost breathless accents was repeating I did not steal the meat I did not steal the meat The poor man at last took refuge in the river The whites who were in pursuit of him run on board of one of the boats to see if they could discover him They finally espied him under the bow of the steamboat Trenton They got a pike pole and tried to drive him from his hiding place When they would strike at him he would dive under the water The water was so cold that it soon became evident that he must come out or be drowned While they were trying to drive him from under the bow of the boat or drown him he would in broken and imploring accents say I did not steal the meat I did not steal the meat My master lives up the river I want to see my master I did not steal the meat Do let me go home to master After punching him and striking him over the head for some time he at last sunk in the water to rise no more alive On the end of the pike pole with which they were striking him was a hook which caught in his clothing and they hauled him up on the bow of the boat Some said he was dead others said he was playing possum while others kicked him to make him get up but it was of no use he was dead As soon as they became satisfied of this they commenced leaving one after another One of the hands on the boat informed the captain that they had killed the man and that the dead body was lying on the deck The captain came on deck and said to those who were remaining You have killed this nigger now take him off of my boat The captain's name was Hart The dead body was dragged on shore and left there I went on board of the boat where our gang of slaves were and during the whole night my mind was occupied with what I had seen Early in the morning I went on shore to see if the dead body remained there I found it in the same position that it was left the night before I watched to see what they would do with it It was left there until between eight and nine o'clock when a cart which takes up the trash out of the streets came along and the body was thrown in and in a few minutes more was covered over with dirt which they were removing from the streets During the whole time I did not see more than six or seven persons around it who from their manner evidently regarded it as no uncommon occurrence During our stay in the city I met with a young white man with whom I was well acquainted in St Louis He had been sold into slavery under the following circumstances His father was a drunkard and very poor with a family of five or six children The father died and left the mother to take care of and provide for the children as best she might The eldest was a boy named Burrill about thirteen years of age who did chores in a store kept by Mr Riley to assist his mother in procuring a living for the family After working with him two years Mr Riley took him to New Orleans to wait on him while in that city on a visit and when he returned to St Louis he told the mother of the boy that he had died with the yellow fever Nothing more was heard from him no one supposing him to be alive I was much astonished when Burrill told me his history Though I sympathized with him I could not assist him We were both slaves He was poor uneducated and without friends and if living is I presume still held as a slave After selling out this cargo of human flesh we returned to St Louis and my time was up with Mr Walker I had served him one year and it was the longest year I ever lived VII I WAS sent home and was glad enough to leave the service of one who was tearing the husband from the wife the child from the mother and the sister from the brother but a trial more severe and heart rending than any which I had yet met with awaited me My dear sister had been sold to a man who was going to Natchez and was lying in jail awaiting the hour of his departure She had expressed her determination to die rather than go to the far south and she was put in jail for safekeeping I went to the jail the same day that I arrived but as the jailer was not in I could not see her I went home to my master in the country and the first day after my return he came where I was at work and spoke to me very politely I knew from his appearance that something was the matter After talking to me about my several journeys to New Orleans with Mr Walker he told me that he was hard pressed for money and as he had sold my mother and all her children except me he thought it would be better to sell me than any other one and that as I had been used to living in the city he thought it probable that I would prefer it to a country life I raised up my head and looked him full in the face When my eyes caught his he immediately looked to the ground After a short pause I said Master mother has often told me that you are a near relative of mine and I have often heard you admit the fact and after you have hired me out and received as I once heard you say nine hundred dollars for my service after receiving this large sum will you sell me to be carried to New Orleans or some other place No said he I do not intend to sell you to a negro trader If I had wished to have done that I might have sold you to Mr Walker for a large sum but I would not sell you to a negro trader You may go to the city and find you a good master But said I I cannot find a good master in the whole city of St Louis Why said he Because there are no good masters in the state Do you not call me a good master If you were you would not sell me Now I will give you one week to find a master in and surely you can do it in that time The price set by my evangelical master upon my soul and body was the trifling sum of five hundred dollars I tried to enter into some arrangement by which I might purchase my freedom but he would enter into no such arrangement I set out for the city with the understanding that I was to return in a week with some one to become my new master Soon after reaching the city I went to the jail to learn if I could once more see my sister but could not gain admission I then went to mother and learned from her that the owner of my sister intended to start for Natchez in a few days I went to the jail again the next day and Mr Simonds the keeper allowed me to see my sister for the last time I cannot give a just description of the scene at that parting interview Never never can be erased from my heart the occurrences of that day When I entered the room where she was she was seated in one corner alone There were four other women in the same room belonging to the same man He had purchased them he said for his own use She was seated with her face towards the door where I entered yet she did not look up until I walked up to her As soon as she observed me she sprung up threw her arms around my neck leaned her head upon my breast and without uttering a word burst into tears As soon as she recovered herself sufficiently to speak she advised me to take mother and try to get out of slavery She said there was no hope for herself that she must live and die a slave After giving her some advice and taking from my finger a ring and placing it upon hers I bade her farewell forever and returned to my mother and then and there made up my mind to leave for Canada as soon as possible I had been in the city nearly two days and as I was to be absent only a week I thought best to get on my journey as soon as possible In conversing with mother I found her unwilling to make the attempt to reach a land of liberty but she counselled me to get my liberty if I could She said as all her children were in slavery she did not wish to leave them I could not bear the idea of leaving her among those pirates when there was a prospect of being able to get away from them After much persuasion I succeeded in inducing her to make the attempt to get away The time fixed for our departure was the next night I had with me a little money that I had received from time to time from gentlemen for whom I had done errands I took my scanty means and purchased some dried beef crackers and cheese which I carried to mother who had provided herself with a bag to carry it in I occasionally thought of my old master and of my mission to the city to find a new one I waited with the most intense anxiety for the appointed time to leave the land of slavery in search of a land of liberty The time at length arrived and we left the city just as the clock struck nine We proceeded to the upper part of the city where I had been two or three times during the day and selected a skiff to carry us across the river The boat was not mine nor did I know to whom it did belong neither did I care The boat was fastened with a small pole which with the aid of a rail I soon loosened from its moorings After hunting round and finding a board to use as an oar I turned to the city and bidding it a long farewell pushed off my boat The current running very swift we had not reached the middle of the stream before we were directly opposite the city We were soon upon the Illinois shore and leaping from the boat turned it adrift and the last I saw of it it was going down the river at good speed We took the main road to Alton and passed through just at daylight when we made for the woods where we remained during the day Our reason for going into the woods was that we expected that Mr Mansfield the man who owned my mother would start in pursuit of her as soon as he discovered that she was missing He also new that I had been in the city looking for a new master and we thought probably he would go out to my master's to see if he could find my mother and in so doing Dr Young might be led to suspect that I had gone to Canada to find a purchaser We remained in the woods during the day and as soon as darkness overshadowed the earth we started again on our gloomy way having no guide but the NORTH STAR We continued to travel by night and secrete ourselves in the woods by day and every night before emerging from our hiding place we would anxiously look for our friend and leader the NORTH STAR And in the language of Pierpont we might have exclaimed Star of the North while blazing day Pours round me its full tide of light And hides thy pale but faithful ray I too lie hid and long for night For night I dare not walk at noon Nor dare I trust the faithless moon Nor faithless man whose burning lust For gold hath riveted my chain No other leader can I trust But thee of even the starry train For all the host around thee burning Like faithless man keep turning turning In the dark top of southern pines I nestled when the driver's horn Called to the field in lengthening lines My fellows at the break of morn And there I lay till thy sweet face Looked in upon my 'hiding place ' Star of the North Thy light that no poor slave deceiveth Shall set me free VIII As we travelled towards a land of liberty my heart would at times leap for joy At other times being as I was almost constantly on my feet I felt as though I could travel no further But when I thought of slavery with its democratic whips its republican chains its evangelical blood hounds and its religious slave holders when I thought of all this paraphernalia of American democracy and religion behind me and the prospect of liberty before me I was encouraged to press forward my heart was strengthened and I forgot that I was tired or hungry On the eighth day of our journey we had a very heavy rain and in a few hours after it commenced we had not a dry thread upon our bodies This made our journey still more unpleasant On the tenth day we found ourselves entirely destitute of provisions and how to obtain any we could not tell We finally resolved to stop at some farm house and try to get something to eat We had no sooner determined to do this than we went to a house and asked them for some food We were treated with great kindness and they not only gave us something to eat but gave us provisions to carry with us They advised us to travel by day and lie by at night Finding ourselves about one hundred and fifty miles from St Louis we concluded that it would be safe to travel by daylight and did not leave the house until the next morning We travelled on that day through a thickly settled country and through one small village Though we were fleeing from a land of oppression our hearts were still there My dear sister and two beloved brothers were behind us and the idea of giving them up and leaving them forever made us feel sad But with all this depression of heart the thought that I should one day be free and call my body my own buoyed me up and made my heart leap for joy I had just been telling my mother how I should try to get employment as soon as we reached Canada and how I intended to purchase us a little farm and how I would earn money enough to buy sister and brothers and how happy we would be in our own FREE HOME when three men came up on horseback and ordered us to stop I turned to the one who appeared to be the principal man and asked him what he wanted He said he had a warrant to take us up The three immediately dismounted and one took from his pocket a handbill advertising us as runaways and offering a reward of two hundred dollars for our apprehension and delivery in the city of St Louis The advertisement had been put out by Isaac Mansfield and John Young While they were reading the advertisement mother looked me in the face and burst into tears A cold chill ran over me and such a sensation I never experienced before and I hope never to again They took out a rope and tied me and we were taken back about six miles to the house of the individual who appeared to be the leader We reached there about seven o'clock in the evening had supper and were separated for the night Two men remained in the room during the night Before the family retired to rest they were all called together to attend prayers The man who but a few hours before had bound my hands together with a strong cord read a from the The author and his mother arrested and carried back into slavery Bible and then offered up prayer just as though God had sanctioned the act he had just committed upon a poor panting fugitive slave The next morning a blacksmith came in and put a pair of handcuffs on me and we started on our journey back to the land of whips chains and Bibles Mother was not tied but was closely watched at night We were carried back in a wagon and after four days' travel we came in sight of St Louis I cannot describe my feelings upon approaching the city As we were crossing the ferry Mr Wiggins the owner of the ferry came up to me and inquired what I had been doing that I was in chains He had not heard that I had run away In a few minutes we were on the Missouri side and were taken directly to the jail On the way thither I saw several of my friends who gave me a nod of recognition as I passed them After reaching the jail we were locked up in different apartments IX I HAD been in jail but a short time when I heard that my master was sick and nothing brought more joy to my heart than that intelligence I prayed fervently for him not for his recovery but for his death I knew he would be exasperated at having to pay for my apprehension and knowing his cruelty I feared him While in jail I learned that my sister Elizabeth who was in prison when we left the city had been carried off four days before our arrival I had been in jail but a few hours when three negro traders learning that I was secured thus for running away came to my prison house and looked at me expecting that I would be offered for sale Mr Mansfield the man who owned mother came into the jail as soon as Mr Jones the man who arrested us informed him that he had brought her back He told her that he would not whip her but would sell her to a negro trader or take her to New Orleans himself After being in jail about one week master sent a man to take me our of jail and send me home I was taken out and carried home and the old man was well enough to sit up He had me brought into the room where he was and as I entered he asked me where I had been I told him I had acted according to his orders He had told me to look for a master and I had been to look for one He answered that he did not tell me to go to Canada to look for a master I told him that as I had served him faithfully and had been the means of putting a number of hundreds of dollars into his pocket I thought I had a right to my liberty He said he had promised my father that I should not be sold to supply the New Orleans market or he would sell me to a negro trader I was ordered to go into the field to work and was closely watched by the overseer during the day and locked up at night The overseer gave me a severe whipping on the second day that I was in the field I had been at home but a short time when master was able to ride to the city and on his return he informed me that he had sold me to Samuel Willi a merchant tailor I knew Mr Willi I had lived with him three or four months some years before when he hired me of my master Mr Willi was not considered by his servants as a very bad man nor was he the best of masters I went to my new home and found my new mistress very glad to see me Mr Willi owned two servants before he purchased me Robert and Charlotte Robert was an excellent white washer and hired his time from his master paying him one dollar per day besides taking care of himself He was known in the city by the name of Bob Music Charlotte was an old woman who attended to the cooking washing c Mr Willi was not a wealthy man and did not feel able to keep many servants around his house so he soon decided to hire me out and as I had been accustomed to service in steamboats he gave me the privilege of finding such employment I soon secured a situation on board the steamer Otto Capt J B Hill which sailed from St Louis to Independence Missouri My former master Dr Young did not let Mr Willi know that I had run away or he would not have permitted me to go on board a steamboat The boat was not quite ready to commence running and therefore I had to remain with Mr Willi But during this time I had to undergo a trial for which I was entirely unprepared My mother who had been in jail since her return until the present time was now about being carried to New Orleans to die on a cotton sugar or rice plantation I had been several times to the jail but could obtain no interview with her I ascertained however the time the boat in which she was to embark would sail and as I had not seen mother since her being thrown into prison I felt anxious for the hour of sailing to come At last the day arrived when I was to see her for the first time after our painful separation and for aught that I knew for the last time in this world At about ten o'clock in the morning I went on board of the boat and found her there in company with fifty or sixty other slaves She was chained to another woman On seeing me she immediately dropped her head upon her heaving bosom She moved not neither did she weep Her emotions were too deep for tears I approached threw my arms around her neck kissed her and fell upon my knees begging her forgiveness for I thought myself to blame for her sad condition for if I had not persuaded her to accompany me she would not then have been in chains She finally raised her head looked me in the face and such a look none but an angel can give and said My dear son you are not to blame for my being here You have done nothing more nor less than your duty Do not I pray you weep for me I cannot last long upon a cotton plantation I feel that my heavenly Master will soon call me home and then I shall be out of the hands of the slave holders I could bear no more my heart struggled to free itself from the human form In a moment she saw Mr Mansfield coming toward that part of the boat and she whispered into my ear My child we must soon part to meet no more this side of the grave You have ever said that you would not die a slave that you would be a freeman Now try to get your liberty You will soon have no one to look after but yourself and just as she whispered the last sentence into my ear Mansfield came up to me and with an oath said Leave here this instant you have been the means of my losing one hundred dollars to get this wench back at the same time kicking me with a heavy pair of boots As I left her she gave one shriek saying God be with you It was the last time that I saw her and the last word I heard her utter I walked on shore The bell was tolling The boat was about to start I stood with a heavy heart waiting to see her leave the wharf As I thought of my mother I could but feel that I had lost the glory of my life My blessing and my pride I half forgot the name of slave When she was by my side The love of liberty that had been burning in my bosom had well nigh gone out I felt as though I was ready to die The boat moved gently from the wharf and while she glided down the river I realized that my mother was indeed Gone gone sold and gone To the rice swamp dank and lone After the boat was out of sight I returned home but my thoughts were so absorbed in what I had witnessed that I knew not what I was about half of the time Night came but it brought no sleep to my eyes In a few days the boat upon which I was to work being ready I went on board to commence This employment suited me better than living in the city and I remained until the close of navigation though it proved anything but pleasant The captain was a drunken profligate hard hearted creature not knowing how to treat himself or any other person The boat on its second trip brought down Mr Walker the man of whom I have spoken in a previous as hiring my time He had between one and two hundred slaves chained and manacled Among them was a man that formerly belonged to my old master's brother Aaron Young His name was Solomon He was a preacher and belonged to the same church with his master I was glad to see the old man He wept like a child when he told me how he had been sold from his wife and children The boat carried down while I remained on board four or five gangs of slaves Missouri though a comparatively new state is very much engaged in raising slaves to supply the southern market In a former I have mentioned that I was once in the employ of a slave trader or driver as he is called at the south For fear that some may think that I have misrepresented a slave driver I will here give an extract from a paper published in a slave holding state Tennessee called the Millennial Trumpeter Droves of negroes chained together in dozens and scores and hand cuffed have been driven through our country in numbers far surpassing any previous year and these vile slave drivers and dealers are swarming like buzzards around a carrion Through this county you cannot pass a few miles in the great roads without having every feeling of humanity insulted and lacerated by this spectacle nor can you go into any county or any neighborhood scarcely without seeing or hearing of some of these despicable creatures called negro drivers Who is a negro driver One whose eyes dwell with delight on lacerated bodies of helpless men women and children whose soul feels diabolical raptures at the chains and hand cuffs and cart whips for inflicting tortures on weeping mothers torn from helpless babes and on husbands and wives torn asunder forever Dark and revolting as is the picture here drawn it is from the pen of one living in the midst of slavery But though these men may cant about negro drivers and tell what despicable creatures they are who is it I ask that supplies them with the human beings that they are tearing asunder I answer as far as I have any knowledge of the state where I came from that those who raise slaves for the market are to be found among all classes from Thomas H Benton down to the lowest political demagogue who may be able to purchase a woman for the purpose of raising stock and from the doctor of divinity down to the most humble lay member in the church It was not uncommon in St Louis to pass by an auction stand and behold a woman upon the auction block and hear the seller crying out How much is offered for this woman She is a good cook good washer a good obedient servant She has got religion Why should this man tell the purchasers that she has religion I answer because in Missouri and as far as I have any knowledge of slavery in the other states the religious teaching consists in teaching the slave that he must never strike a white man that God made him for a slave and that when whipped he must not find fault for the Bible says He that knoweth his master's will and doeth it not shall be beaten with many stripes And slave holders find such religion very profitable to them After leaving the steamer Otto I resided at home in Mr Willi's family and again began to lay plans for making my escape from slavery The anxiety to be a freeman would not let me rest day or night I would think of the northern cities that had heard so much about of Canada where so many of my acquaintances had found a refuge I would dream at night that I was in Canada a freeman and on waking in the morning weep to find myself so sadly mistaken I would think of Victoria's domain And in a moment I seemed to be there But the fear of being taken again Soon hurried me back to despair Mr Willi treated me better than Dr Young ever had but instead of making me contented and happy it only rendered me the more miserable for it enabled me better to appreciate liberty Mr Willi was a man who loved money as most men do and without looking for an opportunity to sell me he found one in the offer of Captain Enoch Price a steamboat owner and commission merchant living in the city of St Louis Captain Price tendered seven hundred dollars which was two hundred more than Mr Willi had paid He therefore thought best to accept the offer I was wanted for a carriage driver and Mrs Price was very much pleased with the captain's bargain His family consisted of himself wife one child and three servants besides myself one man and two women Mrs Price was very proud of her servants always keeping them well dressed and as soon as I had been purchased she resolved to have a new carriage And soon one was procured and all preparations were made for a turn out in grand style I being the driver One of the female servants was a girl some eighteen or twenty years of age named Maria Mrs Price was very soon determined to have us united if she could so arrange matters She would often urge upon me the necessity of having a wife saying that it would be so pleasant for me to take one in the same family But getting married while in slavery was the last of my thoughts and had I been ever so inclined I should not have married Maria as my love had already gone in another quarter Mrs Price soon found out that her efforts at this match making between Maria and myself would not prove successful She also discovered or thought she had that I was rather partial to a girl named Eliza who was owned by Dr Mills This induced her at once to endeavor the purchase of Eliza so great was her desire to get me a wife Before making the attempt however she deemed it best to talk to me a little upon the subject of love courtship and marriage Accordingly one afternoon she called me into her room telling me to take a chair and sit down I did so thinking it rather strange for servants are not very often asked thus to sit down in the same room with the master or mistress She said that she had found out that I did not care enough about Maria to marry her I told her that was true She then asked me if there was not a girl in the city that I loved Well now this was coming into too close quarters with me People generally don't like to tell their love stories to everybody that may think fit to ask about them and it was so with me But after blushing a while and recovering myself I told her that I did not want a wife She then asked me if I did not think something of Eliza I told her that I did She then said that if I wished to marry Eliza she would purchase her if she could I gave but little encouragement to this proposition as I was determined to make another trial to get my liberty and I knew that if I should have a wife I should not be willing to leave her behind and if I should attempt to bring her with me the chances would be difficult for success However Eliza was purchased and brought into the family X BUT the more I thought of the trap laid by Mrs Price to make me satisfied with my new home by getting me a wife the more I determined never to marry any woman on earth until I should get my liberty But this secret I was compelled to keep to myself which placed me in a very critical position I must keep upon good terms with Mrs Price and Eliza I therefore promised Mrs Price that I would marry Eliza but said that I was not then ready And I had to keep upon good terms with Eliza for fear that Mrs Price would find out that I did not intend to get married I have here spoken of marriage and it is very common among slaves themselves to talk of it And it is common for slaves to be married or at least to have the marriage ceremony performed But there is no such thing as slaves being lawfully married There has never yet a case occurred where a slave has been tried for bigamy The man may have as many women as he wishes and the women as many men and the law takes no cognizance of such acts among slaves And in fact some masters when they have sold the husband from the wife compel her to take another There lived opposite Captain Price's Doctor Farrar well known in St Louis He sold a man named Ben to one of the traders He also owned Ben's wife and in a few days he compelled Sally that was her name to marry Peter another man belonging to him I asked Sally why she married Peter so soon after Ben was sold She said because master made her do it Mr John Calvert who resided near our place had a woman named Lavinia She was quite young and a man to whom she was about to be married was sold and carried into the country near St Charles about twenty miles from St Louis Mr Calvert wanted her to get a husband but she had resolved not to marry any other man and she refused Mr Calvert whipped her in such a manner that it was thought she would die Some of the citizens had him arrested but it was soon hushed up And that was the last of it The woman did not die but it would have been the same if she had Captain Price purchased me in the month of October and I remained with him until December when the family made a voyage to New Orleans in a boat owned by himself and named the Chester I served on board as one of the stewards On arriving at New Orleans about the middle of the month the boat took in freight for Cincinnati and it was decided that the family should go up the river in her and what was of more interest to me I was to accompany them The long looked for opportunity to make my escape from slavery was near at hand Captain Price had some fears as to the propriety of taking me near a free state or a place where it was likely I could run away with a prospect of liberty He asked me if I had ever been in a free state Oh yes said I I have been in Ohio my master carried me into that state once but I never liked a free state It was soon decided that it would be safe to take me with them and what made it more safe Eliza was on the boat with us and Mrs Price to try me asked if I thought as much as ever of Eliza I told her that Eliza was very dear to me indeed and that nothing but death should part us It was the same as if we were married This had the desired effect The boat left New Orleans and proceeded up the river I had at different times obtained little sums of money which I had reserved for a rainy day I procured some cotton cloth and made me a bag to carry provisions in The trials of the past were all lost in hopes for the future The love of liberty that had been burning in my bosom for years and had been well nigh extinguished was now resuscitated At night when all around was peaceful I would walk the decks meditating upon my happy prospects I should have stated that before leaving St Louis I went to an old man named Frank a slave owned by a Mr Sarpee This old man was very distinguished not only among the slave population but also the whites as a fortune teller He was about seventy years of age something over six feet high and very slender Indeed he was so small around his body that it looked as though it was not strong enough to hold up his head Uncle Frank was a very great favorite with the young ladies who would go to him in great numbers to get their fortunes told And it was generally believed that he could really penetrate into the mysteries of futurity Whether true or not he had the name and that is about half of what one needs in this gullible age I found Uncle Frank seated in the chimney corner about ten o'clock at night As soon as I entered the old man left his seat I watched his movement as well as I could by the dim light of the fire He soon lit a lamp and coming up looked me full in the face saying Well my son you have come to get uncle to tell your fortune have you Yes said I But how the old man should know what I came for I could not tell However I paid the fee of twenty five cents and he commenced by looking into a gourd filled with water Whether the old man was a prophet or the son of a prophet I cannot say but there is one thing certain many of his predictions were verified I am no believer in soothsaying yet I am sometimes at a loss to know how Uncle Frank could tell so accurately what would occur in the future Among the many things he told was one which was enough to pay me for all the trouble of hunting him up It was that I should be free He further said that in trying to get my liberty I would meet with many severe trials I thought to myself any fool could tell me that The first place in which we landed in a free state was Cairo a small village at the mouth of the Ohio river We remained here but a few hours when we proceeded to Louisville After unloading some of the cargo the boat started on her upward trip The next day was the first of January I had looked forward to New Year's day as the commencement of a new era in the history of my life I had decided upon leaving the peculiar institution that day During the last night that I served in slavery I did not close my eyes a single moment When not thinking of the future my mind dwelt on the past The love of a dear mother a dear sister and three dear brothers yet living caused me to shed many tears If I could only have been assured of their being dead I should have felt satisfied but I imagined I saw my dear mother in the cotton field followed by a merciless task master and no one to speak a consoling word to her I beheld my dear sister in the hands of a slave driver and compelled to submit to his cruelty None but one placed in such a situation can for a moment imagine the intense agony to which these reflections subjected me XI At last the time for action arrived The boat landed at a point which appeared to me the place of all others to start from I found that it would be impossible to carry anything with me but what was upon my person I had some provisions and a single suit of clothes about half worn When the boat was discharging her cargo and the passengers engaged carrying their baggage on and off shore I improved the opportunity to convey myself with my little effects on land Taking up a trunk I went up the wharf and was soon out of the crowd I made directly for the woods where I remained until night knowing well that I could not travel even in the state of Ohio during the day without danger of being arrested I had long since made up my mind that I would not trust myself in the hands of any man white or colored The slave is brought up to look upon every white man as an enemy to him and his race and twenty one years in slavery had taught me that there were traitors even among colored people After dark I emerged from the woods into a narrow path which led me into the main travelled road But I knew not which way to go I did not know north from south east from west I looked in vain for the North Star a heavy cloud hid it from my view I walked up and down the road until near midnight when the clouds disappeared and I welcomed the sight of my friend truly the slave's friend the North Star As soon as I saw it I knew my course and before daylight I travelled twenty or twenty five miles It being in the winter I suffered intensely from the cold being without an overcoat and my other clothes rather thin for the season I was provided with a tinder box so that I could make up a fire when necessary And but for this I should certainly have frozen to death for I was determined not to go to any house for shelter I knew of a man belonging to Gen Ashly of St Louis who had run away near Cincinnati on the way to Washington but had been caught and carried back into slavery and I felt that a similar fate awaited me should I be seen by any one I travelled at night and lay by during the day On the fourth day my provisions gave out and then what to do I could not tell Have something to eat I must but how to get it was the question On the first night after my food was gone I went to a barn on the road side and there found some ears of corn I took ten or twelve of them and kept on my journey During the next day while in the woods I roasted my corn and feasted upon it thanking God that I was so well provided for My escape to a land of freedom now appeared certain and the prospects of the future occupied a great part of my thoughts What should be my occupation was a subject of much anxiety to me and the next thing what should be my name I have before stated that my old master Dr Young had no children of his own but had with him a nephew the son of his brother Benjamin Young When this boy was brought to Dr Young his name being William the same as mine my mother was ordered to change mine to something else This at the time I thought to be one of the most cruel acts that could be committed upon my rights and I received several very severe whippings for telling people that my name was William after orders were given to change it Though young I was old enough to place a high appreciation upon my name It was decided however to call me Sandford and this name I was known by not only upon my master's plantation but up to the time that I made my escape I was sold under the name of Sandford But as soon as the subject came to my mind I resolved on adopting my old name of William and let Sandford go by the board for I always hated it Not because there was anything peculiar in the name but because it had been forced upon me It is sometimes common at the south for slaves to take the name of their masters Some have a legitimate right to do so But I always detested the idea of being called by the name of either of my masters And as for my father I would rather have adopted the name of Friday and been known as the servant of some Robinson Crusoe than to have taken his name So I was not only hunting for my liberty but also hunting for a name though I regarded the latter as of little consequence if I could but gain the former Travelling along the road I would sometimes speak to myself sounding my name over by way of getting used to it before I should arrive among civilized human beings On the fifth or six day it rained very fast and froze about as fast as it fell so that my clothes were one glare of ice I travelled on at night until I became so chilled and benumbed the wind blowing into my face that I found it impossible to go any further and accordingly took shelter in a barn where I was obliged to walk about to keep from freezing I have ever looked upon that night as the most eventful part of my escape from slavery Nothing but the providence of God and that old barn saved me from freezing to death I received a very severe cold which settled upon my lungs and from time to time my feet had been frost bitten so that it was with difficulty I could walk In this situation I travelled two days when I found that I must seek shelter somewhere or die The thought of death was nothing frightful to me compared with that of being caught and again carried back into slavery Nothing but the prospect of enjoying liberty could have induced me to undergo such trials for Behind I left the whips and chains Before me were sweet Freedom's plains This and this alone cheered me onward But I at last resolved to seek protection from the inclemency of the weather and therefore I secured myself behind some logs and brush intending to wait there until some one should pass by for I thought it probable that I might see some colored person or if not some one who was not a slave holder for I had an idea that I should know a slaveholder as far as I could see him The first person that passed was a man in a buggy wagon He looked too genteel for me to hail him Very soon another passed by on horseback I attempted to speak to him but fear made my voice fail me As he passed I left my hiding place and was approaching the road when I observed an old man walking towards me leading a white horse He had on a broad brimmed hat and a very long coat and was evidently walking for exercise As soon as I saw him and observed his dress I thought to myself You are the man that I have been looking for Nor was I mistaken He was the very man On approaching me he asked me if I was not a slave I looked at him some time and then asked him if he knew of any one who would help me as I was sick He answered that he would but again asked if I was not a slave I told him I was He then said that I was in a very pro slavery neighborhood and if I would wait until he went home he would get a covered wagon for me I promised to remain He mounted his horse and was soon out of sight After he was gone I meditated whether to wait or not being apprehensive that he had gone for some one to arrest me But I finally concluded to remain until he should return removing some few rods to watch his movements After a suspense of an hour and a half or more he returned with a two horse covered wagon such as are usually seen under the shed of a Quaker meeting house on Sundays and Thursdays for the old man proved to be a Quaker of the George Fox stamp He took me to his house but it was some time before I could be induced to enter it not until the old lady came out did I venture into the house I thought I saw something in the old lady's cap that told me I was not only safe but welcome in her house I was not however prepared to receive their hospitalities The only fault I found with them was their being too kind I had never had a white man to treat me as an equal and the idea of a white lady waiting on me at the table was still worse Though the table was loaded with the good things of this life I could not eat I thought if I could only be allowed the privilege of eating in the kitchen I should be more than satisfied Finding that I could not eat the old lady who was a Thompsonian made me a cup of composition or number six but it was so strong and hot that I called it number seven However I soon found myself at home in this family On different occasions when telling these facts I have been asked how I felt upon finding myself regarded as a man by a white family especially just having run away from one I cannot say that I have ever answered the question yet The fact that I was in all probability a freeman sounded in my ears like a charm I am satisfied that none but a slave could place such an appreciation upon liberty as I did at that time I wanted to see mother and sister that I might tell them I was free I wanted to see my fellow slaves in St Louis and let them know that the chains were no longer upon my limbs I wanted to see Captain Price and let him learn from my own lips that I was no more a chattel but a man I was anxious too thus to inform Mrs Price that she must get another coachman And I wanted to see Eliza more than I did either Mr or Mrs Price The fact that I was a freeman could walk talk eat and sleep as a man and no one to stand over me with the blood clotted cow hide all this made me feel that I was not myself The kind friend that had taken me in was named Wells Brown He was a devoted friend of the slave but was very old and not in the enjoyment of good health After being by the fire awhile I found that my feet had been very much frozen I was seized with a fever which threatened to confine me to my bed But my Thompsonian friends soon raised me treating me as kindly as if I had been one of their own children I remained with them twelve or fifteen days during which time they made me some clothing and the old gentleman purchased me a pair of boots I found that I was about fifty or sixty miles from Dayton in the State of Ohio and between one and two hundred miles from Cleaveland on Lake Erie a place I was desirous of reaching on my way to Canada This I know will sound strangely to the ears of people in foreign lands but it is nevertheless true An American citizen was fleeing from a democratic republican Christian government to receive protection under the monarchy of Great Britain While the people of the United States boast of their freedom they at the same time keep three millions of their own citizens in chains and while I am seated here in sight of Bunker Hill Monument writing this narrative I am a slave and no law not even in Massachusetts can protect me from the hands of the slave holder Before leaving this good Quaker friend he inquired what my name was besides William I told him that I had no other name Well said he thee must have another name Since thee has got out of slavery thee has become a man and men always have two names I told him that he was the first man to extend the hand of friendship to me and I would give him the privilege of naming me If I name thee said he I shall call thee Wells Brown after myself But said I I am not willing to lose my name of William As it was taken from me once against my will I am not willing to part with it again upon any terms Then said he I will call thee William Wells Brown So be it said I and I have been known by that name ever since I left the house of my first white friend Wells Brown After giving me some little change I again started for Canada In four days I reached a public house and went into warm myself I there learned that some fugitive slaves had just passed through the place The men in the bar room were talking about it and I thought that it must have been myself they referred to and I was therefore afraid to start fearing they would seize me but I finally mustered courage enough and took my leave As soon as I was out of sight I went into the woods and remained there until night when I again regained the road and travelled on until next day Not having had any food for nearly two days I was faint with hunger and was in a dilemma what to do as the little cash supplied me by my adopted father and which had contributed to my comfort was now all gone I however concluded to go to a farm house and ask for something to eat On approaching the door of the first one presenting itself I knocked and was soon met by a man who asked me what I wanted I told him that I would like something to eat He asked me where I was from and where I was going I replied that I had come some way and was going to Cleaveland After hesitating a moment or two he told me that he could give me nothing to eat adding that if I would work I could get something to eat I felt bad being thus refused something to sustain nature but did not dare tell him that I was a slave Just as I was leaving the door with a heavy heart a woman who proved to be the wife of this gentleman came to the door and asked her husband what I wanted He did not seem inclined to inform her She therefore asked me herself I told her that I had asked for something to eat After a few other questions she told me to come in and that she would give me something to eat I walked up to the door but the husband remained in the passage as if unwilling to let me enter She asked him two or three times to get out of the way and let me in But as he did not move she pushed him on one side bidding me walk in I was never before so glad to see a woman push a man aside Ever since that act I have been in favor of woman's rights After giving me as much food as I could eat she presented me with ten cents all the money then at her disposal accompanied with a note to a friend a few miles further on the road Thanking this angel of mercy from an overflowing heart I pushed on my way and in three days arrived at Cleaveland Ohio Being an entire stranger in this place it was difficult for me to find where to stop I had no money and the lake being frozen I saw that I must remain until the opening of the navigation or go to Canada by way of Buffalo But believing myself to be somewhat out of danger I secured an engagement at the Mansion House as a table waiter in payment for my board The proprietor however whose name was E M Segur in a short time hired me for twelve dollars a month on which terms I remained until spring when I found good employment on board a lake steamboat I purchased some books and at leisure moments perused them with considerable advantage to myself While at Cleaveland I saw for the first time an anti slavery newspaper It was the Genius of Universal Emancipation published by Benjamin Lundy and though I had no home I subscribed for the paper It was my great desire being out of slavery myself to do what I could for the emancipation of my brethren yet in chains and while on Lake Erie I found many opportunities of helping their cause along It is well known that a great number of fugitives make their escape to Canada by way of Cleaveland and while on the lakes I always made arrangement to carry them on the boat to Buffalo or Detroit and thus effect their escape to the promised land The friends of the slave knowing that I would transport them without charge never failed to have a delegation when the boat arrived at Cleaveland I have sometimes had four or five on board at one time In the year I conveyed from the first of May to the first of December sixty nine fugitives over Lake Erie to Canada In I visited Malden in Upper Canada and counted seventeen in that small village whom I had assisted in reaching Canada Soon after coming north I subscribed for the Liberator edited by that champion of freedom William Lloyd Garrison I had heard nothing of the anti slavery movement while in slavery and as soon as I found that my enslaved countrymen had friends who were laboring for their liberation I felt anxious to join them and give what aid I could to the cause I early embraced the temperance cause and found that a temperance reformation was needed among my colored brethren In company with a few friends I commenced a temperance reformation among the colored people in the city of Buffalo and labored three years in which time a society was built up numbering over five hundred out of a population of less than seven hundred In the autumn impressed with the importance of spreading anti slavery truth as a means to bring about the abolition of slavery I commenced lecturing as an agent of the western New York Anti Slavery Society and have ever since devoted my time to the cause of my enslaved countrymen XII DURING the autumn of a slaveholder by the name of Bacon Tate from the State of Tennessee came to the north in search of fugitives from slavery On his arrival at Buffalo he heard of two of the most valuable of the slaves that he was in pursuit of They were residing in St Catharine's in Upper Canada some twenty five miles from Buffalo After hearing that they were in Canada one would have supposed that Tate would have given up all hope of getting them But not so Bacon Tate was a man who had long been engaged in the slave trade and previous to that had been employed as a negro driver In these two situations he had gained the name of being the most complete negro breaker in that part of Tennessee where he resided He was as unfeeling and as devoid of principle as a man could possibly be This made him the person above all others to be selected to be put on the track of the fugitive slave He had not only been commissioned to catch Stanford and his wife the two valuable slaves already alluded to but he had the names of some twenty others Many slaves had made their escape from the vicinity of Nashville and the slaveholders were anxious to have some caught that they might make an example of them And Tate anxious to sustain his high reputation as a negro catcher left no stone unturned to carry out his nefarious objects Stanford and his little family were as happily situated as fugitives can be who make their escape to Canada in the cold season of the year Tate on his arrival at Buffalo took lodgings at the Eagle Tavern the best house at that time in the city And here he began to lay his plans to catch and carry back into slavery those men and women who had undergone so much to get their freedom He soon became acquainted with a profligate colored woman who was a servant in the hotel and who was as unprincipled as himself This woman was sent to St Catharine's to spy out the situation of Stanford's family Under the pretence of wishing to get board in the family and at the same time offering to pay a week's board in advance she was taken in After remaining with them three or four days the spy returned to Buffalo and informed Tate how they were situated By the liberal use of money Tate soon found those who were willing to do his bidding A carriage was hired and four men employed to go with it to St Catharine's and to secure their victims during the night The carriage with the kidnappers crossed the Niagara river at Black Rock on Saturday evening about seven o'clock and went on its way towards St Catharine's no one suspecting in the least that they were after fugitive slaves About twelve o'clock that night they attacked Stanford's dwelling by breaking in the door They found the family asleep and of course met with no obstacle whatever in tying gagging and forcing them into the carriage The family had one child about six weeks old That was kept at its mother's breast to keep it quiet The carriage re crossed the river at the same place the next morning at sunrise and proceeded to Buffalo where it remained a short time and after changing horses and leaving some of its company it proceeded on its journey The carriage being closely covered no one had made the least discovery as to its contents But some time during the morning a man who was neighbor to Stanford and who resided but a short distance from him came on an errand and finding the house deserted and seeing the most of the family's clothes lying on the floor and seeing here and there stains of blood soon gave the alarm and the neighbors started in every direction to see if they could find the kidnappers One man got on the track of the carriage and followed it to the ferry at Black Rock where he heard that it had crossed some three hours before He went on to Buffalo and gave the alarm to the colored people of that place The colored people of Buffalo are noted for their promptness in giving aid to the fugitive slave The alarm was given just as the bells were ringing for church I was in company with five or six others when I heard that a brother slave with his family had been seized and dragged from his home during the night previous We started on a run for the livery stable where we found as many more of our own color trying to hire horses to go in search of the fugitives There were two roads which the kidnappers could take and we were at some loss to know which to take ourselves But we soon determined to be on the right track and so divided our company one half taking the road to Erie the other taking the road leading to Hamburgh I was among those who took the latter We travelled on at a rapid rate until we came within half a mile of Hamburgh Corners when we met a man on the side of the road on foot who made signs to us to stop We halted for a moment when he informed us that the carriage that we were in pursuit of was at the public house and that he was then in search of some of his neighbors to assemble and to demand of the kidnappers the authority by which they were taking these people into slavery We proceeded to the tavern where we found the carriage standing in front of the door with a pair of fresh horses ready to proceed on their journey The kidnappers seeing us coming took their victims into a room and locked the door and fastened down the windows We all dismounted fastened our horses and entered the house We found four or five persons in the bar room who seemed to rejoice as we entered One of our company demanded the opening of the door while others went out and surrounded the house The kidnappers stationed one of their number at the door and another at the window They refused to let us enter the room and the tavern keeper who was more favorable to us than we had anticipated said to us Boys get into the room in any way that you can the house is mine and I give you the liberty to break in through the door or window This was all that we wanted and we were soon making preparations to enter the room at all hazards Those within had warned us that if we should attempt to enter they would shoot the first one One of our company who had obtained a crow bar went to the window and succeeded in getting it under the sash and soon we had the window up and the kidnappers together with their victims in full view One of the kidnappers while we were raising the window kept crying at the top of his voice I'll shoot I'll shoot but no one seemed to mind him As soon as they saw that we were determined to rescue the slaves at all hazards they gave up one of their number telling us that we might come in The door was thrown open and we entered and there found Stanford seated in one corner of the room with his hands tied behind him and his clothing what little he had on much stained with blood Near him was his wife with her child but a few weeks old in her arms Neither of them had anything on except their night clothes They had both been gagged to keep them from alarming the people and had been much beaten and bruised when first attacked by the kidnappers Their countenances lighted up the moment we entered the room The most of those who made up our company were persons who had made their escape from slavery and who knew its horrors from personal experience and who had left near and dear relatives behind them And we knew how to feel for those in bonds as bound with them The woman who had betrayed them and who was in the house at the time they were taken had been persuaded by Tate to go on with him to Tennessee She had accompanied them from Canada and we found her in the same room with Stanford and his wife As soon as she found that we were about to enter the room she ran under the bed We knew nothing of her being in the room until Stanford pointed to the bed and said Under there is our betrayer She was soon hauled out and it was as much as some of us could do to keep the others from lynching her upon the spot The curses came thick and fast from a majority of the company But nothing attracted my attention at the time more than the look of Mrs Stanford at the betrayer as she sat before her She did not say a word to her but her countenance told the feelings of her inmost soul and we could but think that had she spoken to her she would have said May the world deny thee a shelter earth a home the dust a grave the sun his light and Heaven her God The betrayer begged us to let her go I was somewhat disposed to comply with her request but I found many to oppose me in fact I was entirely alone My main reason for wishing to let her escape was that I was afraid that her life would be in danger I knew that if she was taken back to Buffalo or Canada she would fall into the hands of an excited people the most of whom had themselves been slaves And they being comparatively ignorant of the laws would be likely to take the law into their own hands However the woman was not allowed to escape but was put into the coach together with Stanford and his wife and after an hour and a half's drive we found ourselves in the city of Buffalo The excitement which the alarm had created in the morning had broken up the meetings of the colored people for that day and on our arrival in the city we were met by some forty or fifty colored persons The kidnappers had not been inactive for on our arrival in the city we learned that the man who had charge of the carriage and fugitives when we caught up with them returned to the city immediately after giving the slaves up to us and had informed Tate who had remained behind of what had occurred Tate immediately employed the sheriff and his posse to re take the slaves So on our arrival in Buffalo we found that the main battle had yet to be fought Stanford and his wife and child were soon provided with clothing and some refreshment while we were preparing ourselves with clubs pistols knives and other weapons of defence News soon come to us that the sheriff with his under officers together with some sixty or seventy men who were at work on the canal were on the road between Buffalo and Black Rock and that they intended to re take the slaves when we should attempt to take them to the ferry to convey them to Canada This news was anything but pleasant to us but we prepared for the worst We returned to the city about two o'clock in the afternoon and about four we started for Black Rock ferry which is about three miles below Buffalo We had in our company some fifty or more able bodied resolute men who were determined to stand by the slaves and who had resolved before they left the city that if the sheriff and his men took the slaves they should first pass over their dead bodies We started and when about a mile below the city the sheriff and his men came upon us and surrounded us The slaves were in a carriage and the horses were soon stopped and we found it advisable to take them out of the carriage and we did so The sheriff came forward and read something purporting to be a Riot Act and at the same time called upon all good citizens to aid him in keeping the peace This was a trick of his to get possession of the slaves His men rushed upon us with their clubs and stones and a general fight ensued Our company had surrounded the slaves and had succeeded in keeping the sheriff and his men off We fought and at the same time kept pushing on towards the ferry In the midst of the fight a little white man made his appearance among us and proved to be a valuable friend His name was Pepper and he proved himself a pepper to the sheriff and his posse that day He was a lawyer and as the officers would arrest any of our company he would step up and ask the officer if he had a warrant to take that man and as none of them had warrants and could not answer affirmatively he would say to the colored man He has no right to take you knock him down The command was no sooner given than the man would fall If the one who had been arrested was not able to knock him down some who were close by and who were armed with a club or other weapon would come to his assistance After it became generally known in our company that the little man was a lawyer he had a tremendous influence with them You could hear them cry out occasionally That's right knock him down the little man told you to do it and he is a lawyer he knows all about the law that's right hit him again he is a white man and he has done our color enough Such is but a poor representation of what was said by those who were engaged in the fight After a hard fought battle of nearly two hours we arrived at the ferry the slaves still in our possession On arriving at the ferry we found that some of the sheriff's gang had taken possession of the ferry boat Here another battle was to be fought before the slaves could reach Canada The boat was fastened at each end by a chain and in the scuffle for the ascendency one party took charge of one end of the boat while the other took the other end The blacks were commanding the ferryman to carry them over while the whites were commanding him not to While each party was contending for power the slaves were pushed on board and the boat shoved from the wharf Many of the blacks jumped on board of the boat while the whites jumped on shore And the swift current of the Niagara soon carried them off amid the shouts of the blacks and the oaths and imprecations of the whites We on shore swung our hats and gave three cheers just as a reinforcement came to the whites Seeing the odds entirely against us in numbers and having gained the great victory we gave up without resistance and suffered ourselves to be arrested by the sheriff's posse However we all remained on the shore until the ferry boat had landed on the Canada side As the boat landed Stanford leaped on shore and rolled over in the sand and even rubbed it into his hair I did not accompany the boat over but those who did informed us that Mrs Stanford as she stepped on the shore with her child in her arms exclaimed I thank God that I am again in Canada We returned to the city and some forty of our company were lodged in jail to await their trial the next morning And now I will return to the betrayer On our return to Buffalo she was given over to a committee of women who put her in a room and put a guard over her Tate who had been very active from the time that he heard that we had recaptured the carriage with the slaves was still in the city He was not with the slaves when we caught up with them at Hamburgh nor was he to be found in the fight He sent his hirelings while he remained at the hotel drinking champagne As soon as he found the slaves were out of his reach he then made an offer of fifty dollars to any person who would find the betrayer He pretended that he wished to save her from the indignation of the colored people But the fact is he had promised her that if she would accompany him to the south that he would put her in a situation where she would be a lady Poor woman She was foolish enough to believe him and now that the people had lost all sympathy for her on account of her traitorous act he still thought that by pretending to be her friend he could induce her to go to the south that he might sell her But those who had her in charge were determined that she should be punished for being engaged in this villanous transaction Several meetings were held to determine what should be done with her Some were in favor of hanging her others for burning her but a majority were for taking her to the Niagara river tying a fifty six pound weight to her and throwing her in There seemed to be no way in which she could be reached by the civil law She was kept in confinement three days being removed to different places each night So conflicting were the views of those who had her in charge that they could not decide upon what should be done with her However there seemed to be such a vast majority in favor of throwing her into the Niagara river that some of us who were opposed to taking life succeeded in having her given over to another committee who after reprimanding her let her go Tate in the mean time hearing that the colored people had resolved to take vengeance on him thought it best to leave the city On Monday at ten o'clock we were all carried before Justice Grosvenor and of the forty who had been committed the evening before twenty five were held to bail to answer to a higher court When the trials came on we were fined more or less from five to fifty dollars each During the fight no one was killed though there were many broken noses and black eyes one young man who was attached to a theatrical corps was so badly injured in the conflict that he died some three months after Thus ended one of the most fearful fights for human freedom that I ever witnessed The reader will observe that this conflict took place on the Sabbath and that those who were foremost in getting it up were officers of justice The plea of the sheriff and his posse was that we were breaking the Sabbath by assembling in such large numbers to protect a brother slave and his wife and child from being dragged back into slavery which is far worse than death itself From the Liberty Bell of THE AMERICAN SLAVE TRADE BY WILLIAM WELLS BROWN Of the many features which American slavery presents the most cruel is that of the slave trade A traffic in the bodies and souls of native born Americans is carried on in the slave holding states to an extent little dreamed of by the great mass of the people in the non slave holding states The precise number of slaves carried from the slave raising to the slave consuming states we have no means of knowing But it must be very great as forty thousand were sold and carried out of the State of Virginia in one single year This heart rending and cruel traffic is not confined to any particular class of persons No person forfeits his or her character or standing in society by being engaged in raising and selling slaves to supply the cotton sugar and rice plantations of the south Few persons who have visited the slave states have not on their return told of the gangs of slaves they had seen on their way to the southern market This trade presents some of the most revolting and atrocious scenes which can be imagined Slave prisons slave auctions handcuffs whips chains bloodhounds and other instruments of cruelty are part of the furniture which belongs to the American slave trade It is enough to make humanity bleed at every pore to see these implements of torture Known to God only is the amount of human agony and suffering which sends its cry from these slave prisons unheard or unheeded by man up to His ear mothers weeping for their children breaking the night silence with the shrieks of their breaking hearts We wish no human being to experience emotions of needless pain but we do wish that every man woman and child in New England could visit a southern slave prison and auction stand I shall never forget a scene which took place in the city of St Louis while I was in slavery A man and his wife both slaves were brought from the country to the city for sale They were taken to the rooms of AUSTIN SAVAGE auctioneers Several slave speculators who are always to be found at auctions where slaves are to be sold were present The man was first put up and sold to the highest bidder The wife was next ordered to ascend the platform I was present She slowly obeyed the order The auctioneer commenced and soon several hundred dollars were bid My eyes were intensely fixed on the face of the woman whose cheeks were wet with tears But a conversation between the slave and his new master attracted my attention I drew near them to listen The slave was begging his new master to purchase his wife Said he Master if you will only buy Fanny I know you will get the worth of your money She is a good cook a good washer and her last mistress liked her very much If you will only buy her how happy I shall be The new master replied that he did not want her but if she sold cheap he would purchase her I watched the countenance of the man while the different persons were bidding on his wife When his new master bid on his wife you could see the smile upon his countenance and the tears stop but as soon as another would bid you could see the countenance change and the tears start afresh From this change of countenance one could see the workings of the inmost soul But this suspense did not last long the wife was struck off to the highest bidder who proved not to be the owner of her husband As soon as they became aware that they were to be separated they both burst into tears and as she descended from the auction stand the husband walking up to her and taking her by the hand said Well Fanny we are to part forever on earth you have been a good wife to me I did all that I could to get my new master to buy you but he did not want you and all I have to say is I hope you will try to meet me in heaven I shall try to meet you there The wife made no reply but her sobs and cries told too well her own feelings I saw the countenances of a number of whites who were present and whose eyes were dim with tears at hearing the man bid his wife farewell Such are but common occurrences in the slave states At these auction stands bones muscles sinews blood and nerves of human beings are sold with as much indifference as a farmer in the north sells a horse or sheep And this great American nation is at the present time engaged in the slave trade I have before me now the Washington UNION the organ of the government in which I find an advertisement of several slaves to be sold for the benefit of the government They will in all human probability find homes among the rice swamps of Georgia or the canebrakes of Mississippi With every disposition on the part of those who are engaged in it to veil the truth certain facts have from time to time transpired sufficient to show if not the full amount of the evil at least that it is one of prodigious magnitude And what is more to be wondered at is the fact that the greatest slave market is to be found at the capital of the country The American slave trader marches by the capitol with his coffle gang the stars and stripes waving over their heads and the constitution of the United States in his pocket The Alexandria Gazette speaking of the slave trade at the capital says Here you may behold fathers and brothers leaving behind them the dearest objects of affection and moving slowly along in the mute agony of despair there the young mother sobbing over the infant whose innocent smile seems but to increase her misery From some you will hear the burst of bitter lamentation while from others the loud hysteric laugh breaks forth denoting still deeper agony Such is but a faint picture of the American slave trade Boston Massachusetts FLIGHT OF THE BONDMAN DEDICATED TO WILLIAM W BROWN And sung by the Hutchinsons BY ELIAS SMITH FROM the crack of the rifle and baying of hound Takes the poor panting bondman his flight His couch through the day is the cold damp ground But northward he runs through the night O God speed the night of the desolate slave Let his heart never yield to despair There is room 'mong our hills for the true and the brave Let his lungs breathe our free northern air O sweet to the storm driven sailor the light Streaming far o'er the dark swelling wave But sweeter by far 'mong the lights of the night Is the star of the north to the slave Cold and bleak are our mountains and chilling our winds But warm as the soft southern gales Be the hands and the hearts which the hunted one finds 'Mong our hills and our own winter vales Then list to the 'plaint of the heart broken thrall Ye blood hounds go back to your lair May a free northern soil soon give freedom to all Who shall breathe in its pure mountain air FREEDOM'S STAR Respectfully Dedicated to William Wells Brown as a testimony of regard for his uncompromising advocacy of the cause of his enslaved brothers and sisters by D B HARRIS As I strayed from my cot at the close of the day I turned my fond gaze to the sky I beheld all the stars as so sweetly they lay And but one fixed my heart or my eye Shine on northern star thou 'rt beautiful and bright To the slave on his journey afar For he speeds from his foes in the darkness of night Guided on by thy light freedom's star On thee he depends when he threads the dark woods Ere the bloodhounds have hunted him back Thou leadest him on over mountains and floods With thy beams shining full on his track Unwelcome to him is the bright orb of day As it glides o'er the earth and the sea He seeks then to hide like a wild beast of prey But with hope rests his heart upon thee May never a cloud overshadow thy face While the slave flies before his pursuer Gleam steadily on to the end of his race Till his body and soul are secure LAMENT OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE My child we must soon part to meet no more this side of the grave You have ever said that you would not die a slave that you would be a free man Now try to get your liberty W W BROWN'S NARRATIVE I've wandered out beneath the moonlit heaven Lost mother loved and dear To every beam a magic power seems given To bring thy spirit near For though the breeze of freedom fans my brow My soul still turns to thee oh where art thou Where art thou mother I am weary thinking A heritage of pain and woe Was thine beneath it art thou slowly sinking Or hast thou perished long ago And doth thy spirit 'mid the quivering leaves above me Hover dear mother to guard and love me I murmur at my lot in the white man's dwelling The mother there is found Or he may tell where spring buds first are swelling Above her lowly mound But thou lost mother every trace of thee In the vast sepulchre of Slavery Long years have fled since sad faint hearted I stood on Freedom's shore And knew dear mother from thee I was parted To meet thee never more And deemed the tyrant's chain with thee were better Than stranger hearts and limbs without a fetter Yet blessings on thy Roman mother spirit Could I forget it then The parting scene and struggle not to inherit A freeman's birth right once again O noble words O holy love which gave Thee strength to utter them a poor heart broken slave Be near me mother be thy spirit near me Wherever thou may'st be In hours like this bend near that I may hear thee And know that thou art free Summoned at length from bondage toil and pain To God's free world a world without a chain APPENDIX IN giving a history of my own sufferings in slavery as well as the sufferings of others with which I was acquainted or which came under my immediate observation I have spoken harshly of slaveholders in church and state Nor am I inclined to apologize for anything which I have said There are exceptions among slaveholders as well as among other sinners and the fact that a slaveholder feeds his slaves better clothes them better than another does not alter the case he is a slaveholder I do not ask the slaveholder to feed clothe or to treat his victim better as a slave I am not waging a warfare against the collateral evils or what are sometimes called the abuses of slavery I wage a war against slavery itself because it takes man down from the lofty position which God intended he should occupy and places him upon a level with the beasts of the field It decrees that the slave shall not worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience it denies him the word of God it makes him a chattel and sells him in the market to the highest bidder it decrees that he shall not protect the wife of his bosom it takes from him every right which God gave him Clothing and food are as nothing compared with liberty What care I for clothing or food while I am the slave of another You may take me and put cloth upon my back boots upon my feet a hat upon my head and cram a beef steak down my throat and all of this will not satisfy me as long as I know that you have the power to tear me from my dearest relatives All I ask of the slaveholder is to give the slave his liberty It is freedom I ask for the slave And that the American slave will eventually get his freedom no one can doubt You cannot keep the human mind forever locked up in darkness A ray of light a spark from freedom's altar the idea of inherent right each all will become fixed in the soul and that moment his limbs swell beyond the measure of his chains that moment he is free then it is that the slave dies to become a freeman then it is felt that one hour of virtuous liberty is worth an eternity of bondage then it is in the madness and fury of his blood that the excited soul exclaims From life without freedom oh who would not fly For one day of freedom oh who would not die The rising of the slaves in Southampton Virginia in has not been forgotten by the American people Nat Turner a slave for life a Baptist minister entertained the idea that he was another Moses whose duty it was to lead his people out of bondage His soul was fired with the love of liberty and he declared to his fellow slaves that the time had arrived and that They who would be free themselves must strike the blow He knew that it would be liberty or death with his little band of patriots numbering less than three hundred He commenced the struggle for liberty he knew his cause was just and he loved liberty more than he feared death He did not wish to take the lives of the whites he only demanded that himself and brethren might be free The slaveholders found that men whose souls were burning for liberty however small their numbers could not be put down at their pleasure that something more than water was wanted to extinguish the flame They trembled at the idea of meeting men in open combat whose backs they had lacerated whose wives and daughters they had torn from their bosoms whose hearts were bleeding from the wounds inflicted by them They appealed to the United States government for assistance A company of United States troops was sent into Virginia to put down men whose only offence was that they wanted to be free Yes northern men men born and brought up in the free states at the demand of slavery marched to its rescue They succeeded in reducing the poor slave again to his chains but they did not succeed in crushing his spirit Not the combined powers of the American Union not the slaveholders with all their northern allies can extinguish that burning desire of freedom in the slave's soul Northern men may stand by as the body guard of slaveholders They may succeed for the time being in keeping the slave in his chains but unless the slaveholders liberate their victims and that too speedily some modern Hannibal will make his appearance in the southern states who will trouble the slaveholders as the noble Carthaginian did the Romans Abolitionists deprecate the shedding of blood they have warned the slaveholders again and again Yet they will not give heed but still persist in robbing the slave of liberty But for the fear of northern bayonets pledged for the master's protection the slaves would long since have wrung a peaceful emancipation from the fears of their oppressors or sealed their own redemption in blood To the shame of the northern people the slaveholders confess that to them they are indebted for a permanent safe guard against insurrection that a million of their slaves stand ready to strike for liberty at the first tap of the drum and but for the aid of the north they would be too weak to keep them in their chains I ask in the language of the slave's poet What shall ye guard your neighbor still While woman shrieks beneath his rod And while he tramples down at will The image of a common God Shall watch and ward be 'round him set Of northern nerve and bayonet The countenance of the people at the north has quieted the the fears of the slaveholders especially the countenance which they receive from northern churches But for the countenance of the northern church the southern conscience would have long since awakened to its guilt and the impious sight of a church made up of slaveholders and called the church of Christ been scouted from the world So says a distinguished writer Slaveholders hide themselves behind the church A more praying preaching psalm singing people cannot be found than the slaveholders at the south The religion of the south is referred to every day to prove that slaveholders are good pious men But with all their pretensions and all the aid which they get from the northern church they cannot succeed in deceiving the Christian portion of the world Their child robbing man stealing woman whipping chain forging marriage destroying slave manufacturing man slaying religion will not be received as genuine and the people of the free states cannot expect to live in union with slaveholders without becoming contaminated with slavery They are looked upon as one people they are one people the people in the free and slave states form the American Union Slavery is a national institution The nation licenses men to traffic in the bodies and souls of men it supplies them with public buildings at the capital of the country to keep their victims in For a paltry sum it gives the auctioneer a license to sell American men women and children upon the auction stand The American slave trader with the constitution in his hat and his license in his pocket marches his gang of chained men and women under the very eaves of the nation's capitol And this too in a country professing to be the freest nation in the world They profess to be democrats republicans and to believe in the natural equality of men that they are all created with certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness They call themselves a Christian nation they rob three millions of their countrymen of their liberties and then talk of their piety their democracy and their love of liberty and in the language of Shakespeare say And thus I clothe my naked villany And seem a saint when most I play the devil The people of the United States with all their high professions are forging chains for unborn millions in their wars for slavery With all their democracy there is not a foot of land over which the stars and stripes fly upon which the American slave can stand and claim protection Wherever the United States constitution has jurisdiction and the American flag is seen flying they point out the slave as a chattel a thing a piece of property But I thank God there is one spot in America upon which the slave can stand and be a man No matter whether the claimant be a United States president or a doctor of divinity no matter with what solemnities some American court may have pronounced him a slave the moment he makes his escape from under the stars and stripes and sets foot upon the soil of CANADA the altar and the god sink together in the dust his soul walks abroad in her own majesty his body swells beyond the measure of his chains that burst from around him and he stands redeemed regenerated and disenthralled by the irresistible genius of universal emancipation But slavery must and will be banished from the United States soil Let tyrants scorn while tyrants dare The shrieks and writhings of despair The end will come it will not wait Bonds yokes and scourges have their date Slavery itself must pass away And be a tale of yesterday But I will now stop and let the slaveholders speak for themselves I shall here present some evidences of the treatment which slaves receive from their masters after which I will present a few of the slave laws And it has been said and I believe truly that no people were ever found to be better than their laws And as an American slave as

several cuts apparently from a club on the head and around the neck was the indentation of a cord by which it is supposed she had been confined to a tree She had been hired by a man by the name of Tanner residing in the neighborhood and was sent home in this condition After coming home her constant request until her death was for bread by which it would seem that she had been starved as well as unmercifully whipped The jury returned a verdict that she came to her death by the blows inflicted by some persons unknown whilst she was in the employ of Mr Tanner Mrs Tanner has been tried and acquitted A correspondent of the N Y Herald writes from St Louis Oct I yesterday visited the cell of Cornelia the slave charged with being the accomplice of Mrs Ann Tanner recently acquitted in the

are mostly abridged selections from the statutes of the slave states and of the United States They give but a faint view of the cruel oppression to which the slaves are subject but a strong one enough it is thought to fill every honest heart with a deep abhorrence of the atrocious system Most of the important provisions here cited though placed under the name of only one state prevail in nearly all the states with slight variations in language and some diversity in the penalties The extracts have been made in part from Stroud's Sketch of the Slave Laws but chiefly from authorized editions of the statute books referred to found in the Philadelphia Law Library As the compiler has not had access to many of the later enactments of the several states nearly all he has cited are acts of an earlier date than that of the present anti slavery movement so that their severity cannot be ascribed to its influence The cardinal principle of slavery that the slave is not to be ranked among sentient beings but among things is an article of property a chattel personal obtains as undoubted law in all the slave states Stroud's Sketch p The dominion of the master is as unlimited as is that which is

represented in congress for three fifths of their slaves nd that requiring the giving up of any runaway slaves to their masters rd that pledging the physical force of the whole country to suppress insurrections i e attempts to gain freedom by such means as the framers of the instrument themselves used Act of Feb Provides that any master or his agent may seize any person whom he claims as a fugitive from service and take him before a judge of the U S court or magistrate of the city or county where he is taken and the magistrate on proof in support of the claim to his satisfaction must give the claimant a certificate authorizing the removal of such fugitive to the state he fled from DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA The act of congress incorporating Washington city gives the corporation power to prescribe the terms and conditions on which free negroes and mulattoes may reside in the city City Laws and By this authority the city in enacted that any free colored person coming there to reside should give the mayor satisfactory evidence of his freedom and enter into bond with two freehold sureties in the sum of five hundred dollars for his good conduct to be renewed each year for three years or failing to do so must leave the city or be committed to the work house for not more than one year and if he still refuse to go may be again committed for the same period and so on Ib Colored persons residing in the city who cannot prove their title to freedom shall be imprisoned as absconding slaves Ib By the operation of this provision twelve slave holding states whose white population only equals that of New York and Ohio send to congress senators and representatives while these two states only send senators and representatives Thus it may be seen that a man may be doomed to slavery by an authority not considered sufficient to settle a claim of twenty dollars Colored persons found without free papers may be arrested as runaway slaves and after two months' notice if no claimant appears must be advertised ten days and sold to pay their jail fees Stroud note The city of Washington grants a license to trade in slaves for profit as agent or otherwise for four hundred

TO THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM AND EMANCIPATION IN EUROPE Boston July In consequence of the departure for England of their esteemed friend and faithful co labourer in the cause of the American slave William W Brown the Board of Managers of the Massachusetts Anti Slavery Society would commend him to the confidence respect esteem and hospitality of the friends of emancipation wherever he may travel Because he is a fugitive slave from the American house of bondage and on the soil which gave him birth can find no spot on which he can stand in safety from his pursuers protected by law Because he is a man and not a chattel and while as the latter he may at any time be sold at public vendue under the American star spangled banner we rejoice to know that he will be recognised and protected as the former under the flag of England Because for several years past he has nobly consecrated his time and talents at great personal hazard and under the most adverse circumstances to the uncompromising advocacy of the cause of his enslaved countrymen Because he visits England for the purpose of increasing consolidating and directing British humanity and piety against that horrible system of slavery in America by which three millions of human beings by creation the children of God are ranked with four footed beasts and treated as marketable commodities Because he has long been in their employment as a lecturing agent in Massachusetts and has laboured to great acceptance and with great success and from the acquaintance thus formed they are enabled to certify that he has invariably conducted himself with great circumspection and won for himself the sympathy respect and friendship of a very large circle of acquaintance In behalf of the Board of Managers WM LLOYD GARRISON ROBERT F WALLCUT SAMUEL MAY JUN Boston July My dear friend To day you leave the land of your nativity in which you have been reared and treated as a slave a chattel personal a marketable commodity though it claims to be a republican and Christian land the freest of the free the most pious of the pious for the shores of Europe on touching which your shackles will instantly fall your limbs expand your spirit exult in absolute personal freedom as a man and nothing less than a man Since your escape from bondage a few years since you have nobly devoted yourself to the cause of the three millions of our countrymen who are yet clanking their chains in hopeless bondage pleading their cause eloquently and effectively by day and by night in season and out of season before the people of the Free States falsely so called of America at much personal hazard of being seized and hurried back to slavery Not to forsake that cause but still more powerfully to aid it by enlisting the sympathies and consolidating the feelings and opinions of the friends of freedom and universal emancipation in the old world in its favour and against the atrocious slave system do you bid farewell to the land of whips and chains to day God the God of the oppressed the poor the needy the defenceless be with you to guide strengthen aid and bless you abundantly Three millions of slaves are your constituents and you are their legitimate and faithful representative With a mother sister and three brothers yet pining in hopeless servitude with the marks of the slavedriver's lash upon your body you cannot but remember them that are in bonds as bound with them Speak in trumpet tones to Europe and call upon the friends of liberty equality and fraternity there to cry Shame upon recreant and apostate America which flourishes the Declaration of Independence in one hand and the whip of the negro overseer in the other Challenge all that is free all that is humane all that is pious across the Atlantic to raise a united testimony against American slaveholders and their abettors as the enemies of God and the human race So shall that cry and that testimony cause the knees of the oppressor to smite together the Bastile of slavery to tremble to its foundation and the hearts of the American abolitionists to be filled with joy and inspired afresh Tell Europe that our watchword is Immediate unconditional emancipation for the slave and the motto we have placed on our anti slavery banner is No Union with Slaveholders religiously or politically You have secured the respect confidence and esteem of

JOHN T HILTON President ISAAC I SNOWDEN WM T RAYMOND Secretaries OPINIONS OF THE AMERICAN PRESS NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF WILLIAM WELLS BROWN A FUGITIVE SLAVE WRITTEN BY HIMSELF We have received a copy of the above book and have read it Wells Brown the Christian philanthropist who fed clothed and otherwise assisted this panting fugitive and to whom this little book is dedicated is truly a happy man This act of humanity though among perhaps the hundreds in his life of a similar character and in defiance of the law solemnly made will we doubt not redound even to his everlasting happiness The thoughts and feelings which naturally arise from the perusal of this little narrative make all questions of party and sectarian rivalry appear utterly insignificant We would that a copy of this book could be placed in every school library in Massachusetts We hope and believe that it will be widely circulated Boston Whig NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF WM W BROWN A FUGITIVE SLAVE WRITTEN BY HIMSELF This is the title of a book that has just made its appearance and a copy of which is upon our table The author is well known in this community as an able advocate of his enslaved countrymen and his narrative will we doubt not get an extensive circulation We have read the narrative and consider it a fair history of the author's life and of slavery at the South It is an interesting narrative and should be read by every person in the country We commend it to the public and venture the assertion that no one who takes it up and reads a will lay it down until he has finished it New Bedford Bulletin WILLIAM W BROWN ON SLAVERY This talented American slave has delivered three lectures in this town to crowded and very attentive audiences We did not attend the lectures but a friend informed us that they evinced much ability and though rather spicy for the tender ears of those who despise a man on account of the color of his skin they were not as much so as might to have been expected from one who has himself felt the scourge of involuntary servitude not as much so as might have been expected from one who is hunted as a fugitive slave from one end of this notable land of the free to the other We have read Mr Brown's Narrative with great interest and found it a thrilling tale We would recommend it to all who feel any interest in the cause of the American slaves it will quicken their devotion to the cause We would advise the indifferent to read it it will touch them with sympathy for the oppressed bondman Lawrence Courier 
Uncle-TomJones,EXPERIENCE AND PERSONAL NARRATIVE OF UNCLE TOM JONES WHO WAS FOR FORTY YEARS A SLAVE ALSO THE SURPRISING ADVENTURES OF WILD TOM OF THE ISLAND RETREAT A FUGITIVE NEGRO FROM SOUTH CAROLINA BOSTON PUBLISHED BY H B SKINNER No FRIEND STREET SURPRISING ADVENTURES OF UNCLE TOM JONES FOR FORTY YEARS A SLAVE I was born a slave My recollections of early life are associated with poverty suffering and shame I was made to feel in my boyhood's first experience that I was inferior and degraded and that I must pass through life in a dependent and suffering condition The experience of forty three years which were passed by me in slavery was one of dark fears and darker realities John Hawes was my first master He lived in Hanover County N C between the Black and South Rivers and was the owner of a large plantation called Hawes' Plantation He had over fifty slaves I remained with my parents nine years They were both slaves owned by John Hawes They had six children Richard Alexander Charles Sarah myself and John I remember well that dear old cabin with its clay floor and mud chimney in which for nine years I enjoyed the presence and love of my wretched parents Father and mother tried to make it a happy place for their dear children Theyworked late into the night many and many a time to get a little simple furniture for their home and the home of their children and they spent many hours of willing toil to stop up the chinks between the logs of their poor hut that they and their children might be protected from the storm and the cold I can testify from my own painful experience to the deep and fond affection which the slave cherishes in his heart for his home and its dear ones We have no other tie to link us to the human family but our fervent love for those who are with us and of us in relations of sympathy and devotedness in wrongs and wretchedness My dear parents were conscious of the desperate and incurable woe of their position and destiny and the lot of inevitable suffering in store for their beloved children They talked about our coming misery and they lifted up their voices and wept aloud as they spoke of our being torn from them and sold off to the dreaded slave trader perhaps never to see them or hear from them a word of fond love I am a father and have had the same feelings of unspeakable anguish as I have looked upon my precious babes and have thought of the ignorance degradation and woe which they must endure as slaves The great God who knoweth all the secrets of the earth and He only knows the bitter sorrow I now feel when I think of my four dear children who are slaves torn from me and consigned to hopeless servitude by the iron hand of ruthless wrong I love those children with all a father's fondness Mr Hawes was a very severe and cruel master He kept no overseer and supplied his slaves with but a very scanty allowance of food and clothing During the planting and harvest season we had to work early and late The men and women were called at three o'clock in the morning and were worked on the plantation until it was dark at night After that they must prepare their food for supper and for the breakfast of the next day and to attend to other duties of their own dear homes In the month of November and through the winter season the men and women worked in the fields clearing up the new land chopping and burning bushes burning tar kilns and digging ditches They worked together poorly clad and suffering from the bitter cold and wet of those winter months Women wives and mothers daughters and sisters on that plantation were compelled to toil on cold stormy days in the open field while the piercing wind and driving storm benumed their limbs and almost froze the tears that came forth out of their cold and desolate hearts Little boys and girls too worked and cried toting brush to the fires husking the corn watching the stock and running out errands for master and mistress for their three sons Enoch Edward and John and constantly receiving from them scoldings and beatings as their reward Thus passed nine years of my life years of suffering the shuddering memory of which is deeply fixed in my heart These nine years of wretchedness passed and a change came for me My master sold me to Mr Jones of Washington N C distant forty five miles from Hawes' plantation Mr Jones sent his slave driver a colored man named Abraham to conduct me to my new home in Washington I was at home with my mother when he came He looked in at the door and called to me Tom you must go with me His looks were ugly and his voice was savage I was very much afraid and began to cry holding on to my mother's clothes and begging her to protect me and not let the man take me away Mother wept bitterly and in the midst of her loud sobbings cried out in broken words I can't save you Tommy master has sold you you must go She threw her arms around me and while the hot tears fell on my face she strained me to her heart There she held me sobbing and mourning till the brutal Abraham came in snatched me away hurried me out of the house where I was born my only home and tore me away from the dear mother who loved me as no other friend could do She followed him imploring a moment's delay and weeping aloud to the road where he turned around and striking at her with his heavy cowhide fiercely ordered her to stop bawling and go back into the house Thus was I snatched from my loving parents and from the true affection of the dear ones of home For thirteen weary years did my heart turn in its yearnings to that precious home And then at the age of twenty two I was permitted to revisit my early home I found it all desolate the family all broken up father was sold and gone Richard Alexander Charles Sarah and John were sold and gone Mother prematurely old heart broken utterly desolate weak and dying alone remained I saw her and wept once more on her bosom I went back to my chains with a deeper woe in my heart than I had ever felt before There was but one thought of joy in my wretched conscionsness and that was that my kind and precious mother would soon be at rest in the grave And then too I remember I mused with deep earnestness on death as the only friend the poor slave had And I wished that I too might lie down by my mother's side and die with her in her loving embrace My journey to Washington with the heartless Abraham was a very sad one We walked all the way He strode along in stern gloom and silence too fast for my young feet to keep pace and I began to feel that I must stop and rest It was bitter cold too and I was poorly clad to bear the keen air of a January day My limbs were weary with travel and stiff with cold I could not go on at the rate I had done and so I turned to my guide and begged him to take me into some hut and let me rest and get warm He cursed me and told me to keep silence and come along or he would warm me with the cowhide Oh I thought how cruel and hopeless my lot Would that I could fall down here and die And I did fall down We had just passed through a soft wet place and it seemed then to me that I was frozen And I fell down on my dark cold way unable to proceed I was then carried into a slave's cabin and allowed to warm and rest It was nearly midnight when I arrived with my conductor at my place of exile and suffering And certainly no heart could be more entirely wretched than I was when I threw my weary aching body on my cold hard bed The next morning I was called into the presence of Mr Jones my new master and my work was assigned to me I was to take care of the horse sweep the rooms and to bring wood from the wharf on my head for the fires at the house and store with many other duties From the first dawn of day till ten and eleven and sometimes twelve at night I could hardly find one moment's time for rest And Oh how the memory of that year of constant toil and weariness is imprinted on my heart an impression of appalling sorrow My dreams are still haunted with the agony of that year I had just been torn from my home my yearning heart was deprived of the sweet sympathy of those to whose memory I then clung and to whom my heart still turns with irrepressible and unutterable longings I was torn from them and put into a circle of cold selfish and cruel hearts and made to perform labors too great for my young strength And yet I lived through that year just as the slave lives on through weary years of suffering on which no ray or light shines save that which hope of a better happier future gives even to the desolate bondman but I lived through it with all its darkness and sorrow That year I received my first whipping I had failed one day to finish my allotted task It seemed to me that I had done my best but somehow that day thoughts of home came so fresh and tender into my mind and along with these thoughts a sense of my utter hopeless desolation came in and took such a strong hold of my heart that I sank down a helpless heart broken child My tasks for that day were neglected The next morning my master made me strip off my shirt and then whipped me with the cowhide till the blood ran trickling down upon the floor My master was very profane and with dreadful oaths he assured me that there was only one way for me to avoid a repetition of this terrible discipline and that was to do my tasks every day sick or well But this year went by and my duties were changed and my lot was made a little easier The cook Fanny died and I was put into her place I still had to get wood and keep the fires in the house and after the work of cooking setting the table clearing away and washing the dishes there was always something to be done for my mistress I got but little time to rest but I got enough to eat which I had not done the year before I was by the comfortable fire a good part of the cold winter weather instead of being exposed to the cold and wet without warm clothing as I had been the year before and my labor was not so hard this year as it had been the last My mistress complained of me at length that I was not so obedient as I ought to be and so I was taken from the house into the store My business there was to open and sweep out the store in the morning and get all the things ready for the accommodation of customers who might come in during the day Then I had to bring out and deliver all heavy articles that might be called for such as salt large quantities of which were sold in the store ship stores grain etc etc I had also to hold myself ready to run on any errand my master or his clerk David Cogdell might wish to send me on While Cogdell remained in the store I enjoyed a gleam of happiness He was very kind to me never giving me a cross word or a sour look always ready to show me how to do anything which I did not understand and to perform little acts of kindness to me But his kindness and generosity to the poor slaves was very offensive to my master and to other slave holders and so at length Mr Jones turned him off though he was compelled to acknowledge at the same time that he was the most trustworthy and valuable assistant he had ever had in his store After my master dismissed Mr C he tried to get along with me alone in the store He kept the books and waited upon the most genteel of his customers leaving me to do the rest of the work This went on six months when he declared that he could not bear this confinement any longer and so he got a white boy to come and enter as clerk to stay till he was of age James Dixon was a poor boy about my own age and when he came into the store could hardly read or write He was accordingly engaged a part of each day with his books and writing I saw him studying and asked him to let me see his book When he felt in a good humor James was very kind and oblging The great trouble with him was that his fits of ill humor were much more frequent than his times of good feeling It happened however that he was on good terms with himself when I asked him to show me his book and so he let me take it and look at it and he answered very kindly many questions which I asked him about books and schools and learning He told me that he was trying to get learning enough to fit him to do a good business for himself after he should get through with Mr Jones He told me that a man who had learning would always find friends and get along very well in the world without having to work hard while those who had no learning would nave no friends and be compelled to work very hard for a poor living all their days This was all new to me and furnished me topics for wondering thought for days afterwards The result of my meditations was that an intense burning desire to learn to read and write took possession of my mind occupying me wholly in waking hours and stirring up earnest thoughts in my soul even when I slept The question which then took hold of my whole consciousness was how can I get a book to begin James told me that a spelling book was the first one necessary in getting learning So I contrived how I might obtain a spelling book At length after much study I hit upon this plan I cleaned the boots of Mr David Smith Jr who carried on the printing business in Wilmington and edited the Cape Fear Recorder He had always appeared to me to be a very kind man I thought I would get him to aid me in procuring a spelling book So I went one morning with a beating heart into his office and asked him to sell me a spelling book He looked at me in silence and with close attention for some time and asked me what I wanted it for I told him I wanted to learn to read He shook his head and replied No Thomas it would not answer for me to sell you a book to learn out of you will only get yourself into trouble if you attempt it and I advise you to get that foolish notion out of your head as quickly as you can David's brother Peter Smith kept a book and stationary store under the printing office and I next applied to him for a book determined to persevere till I obtained this coveted treasure He asked me the same question that his brother David had done and with the same searching suspicious look By my previous repulse I had discovered that I could not get a spelling book if I told what I wanted to do with it and so I told a lie in order to get it I answered that I wanted it for a white boy naming one that lived at my master's and that he had given me the money to get it with and had asked me to call at the store and buy it The book was then handed out to me the money taken in return and I left feeling very rich with my long desired treasure I got out of the store and looking round to see that no one observed me I hid my book in my bosom and hurried on to my work consicous that a new era in my life was opening upon me through the possession of this book That consciousness at once awakened new thoughts purposes and hopes a new life and aot in my experience My mind was excited The words spoken by James Dixon of the great advantages of learning made me intensely anxious to learn I was a slave and I knew that the whole community was in league to keep the poor slave in ignorance and chains Yet I longed to be free and to be able to move the minds of other men by my thoughts It seemed to me now that if I could learn to read and write this learning might nay I really thought it would point out to me the way to freedom influence and real secure happiness So I hurried on to my master's store and watching my opportunity to do it safe from curious eyes I hid my book with the utmost care under some liquor barrels in the smokehouse The first opportunity I improved to examine it I looked it over with the most intense eagerness turned over its leaves and tried to discover what the new and strange chracters which I saw in its s might mean But I found it a vain endeavor I could understand a picture and from it make out a story of immediate interest to my mind But I could not associate any thought or fact with these crooked letters with which my primmer was filled So the next day I sought a favorable moment and asked James to tell me where a scholar must begin in order to learn to read and how He laughed at my Ignorance and taking his spelling book showed me the alphabet in large and small letters on the same I asked him the name of the first letter pointing it out he told me A so of the next and so on through the alphabet I managed to remember A and B and I studied and looked out the same letters in many other parts of the book And so I fixed in a tenacious memory the names of the two first letters of the alphabet But I found I could not get on without help and so I applied to James again to show me the letters and tell me their names This time he suspected me of trying to learn to read myself and he plied me with questions till he ascertained that I was in good earnest entering upon an effort to get knowledge At this discovery he manifested a good deal of indignation He told me in scorn that it was not for such as me to try to improve that I was a slave and that it was not proper for me to learn to read He threatened to tell my master and at length by his hard language my anger was fully aroused and I answered taunt with taunt He called me a poor miserable nigger and I called him a poor ignorant servant boy While we were engaged in loud and angry words of mutual defiance and scorn my master came into the store Mr Jones had never given me a whipping since the time I have already described during my first year of toil want and suffering in his service But he had now caught me in the unpardonable offence of giving saucy language to a white boy and one too who was in his employ Without stopping to make any inquiries he took down the cow hide and gave me a severe whipping He told me never to talk back to a white man on pain of flogging I suppose this law or custom is universal at the south And I suppose it is thought necessary to enforce ths habit of obsequious submission on the parts of the colored people to the whites in order to maintain their supremacy over the poor outraged slaves I will mention in this connection as illustrative of this cruel custom an incident which I saw just before I ran away from my chains A little colored boy was carrying along through Wilmington a basket of food His name was Ben and he belonged to Mrs Runkin a widow lady A little mischievous white boy just about Ben's age and size met him and purposely overturned the little fellow's basket and scattered his load in the mud Ben in return for this wanton act called him some hard name when the white boy clinched him to throw him down with the scattered fragments upon his basket in the mud Ben resisted and threw down the white boy proving to be the stronger of the two Tom Myers a young lawyer of Wilmington saw the contest and immediately rushing out seized little Ben and dragged him into the store opposite the place of battle He sent out to a saddler's shop procured a cow hide and gave the little fellow a tremendous flogging for the daring crime of resisting a white boy who had wantonly invaded his rights Is it any wonder that the spirit of self respect of the poor ignorant slave is broken down by such treatment of unsparing and persevering cruelty I was now repulsed by James so that I could hope for no assistance from him in learning to read But I could not go on alone I must get some one to aid me in starting or give up the effort to learn This I could not bear to do I thought of a little boy Hiram Bricket ten years old or about that age who came along by the store one day on his way home from school while my master was gone home to dinner and James was in the front part of the store I beckoned to Hiram to come round to the back door and with him I made a bargain to meet me each day at noon when I was allowed a little while to get my dinner and to give me instruction in reading I was to give him six cents a week I met him the next day at his father's stable the place agreed upon for our daily meeting and going into one of the stables the noble little fellow gave me a thorough lesson in the alphabet I learned it nearly all at that time with what study I could give it by stealth during the day and night And then again I felt lifted up and happy I was permitted to enjoy these advantages however but a short time A black boy belonging to Hiram's father one day discovered our meeting and what we were doing He told his master of it and Hiram was at once forbidden this employment I had then got along so that I was reading and spelling in words of two syllables After I was deprived of my kind little teacher I plodded on the best way I could by myself and in this way I got into words of five syllables I got some little time to study by daylight in the morning before any of my master's family had risen I got a moment's opportunity also at noon and sometimes at night During the day I was in the back store a good deal and whenever I thought I could have a few minutes to myself I would take my book and try to learn a little in reading and spelling If I heard James or master Jones or any customer coming in I would drop my book among the barrels and pretended to be very busy shovelling the salt or doing some other work Several times I came very near being detected My master suspected something because I was so still in the back room and a number of times he came very slyly to see what I was about But at such times I was always so fortunate as to hear his tread or to see his shadow on the wall in time to hide away my book When I had got along to words of five syllables I went to see a free colored friend Ned Cowen whom I knew I could trust and told him that I was trying to learn to read and asked him to help me a little He told me I had got along far enough to get another book in which I could learn to write the letters as well as to read He told me where and how to procure this book I followed his directions and obtained another spelling book at Worcester's store in Wilmington Jacob showed me a little about writing He set me a copy first of straight marks I now got me a box which I could hide under my bed some ink pens and a bit of candle So when I went to bed I pulled my box out from under my cot turned it up on end and began my first attempt at writing I worked away till my candle was burned out and then lay down to sleep Jacob next set me a copy which he called pot hooks then the letters of the alphabet These letters were also in my new spelling book and according to Jacob's directions I set them before me for a copy and wrote on these exercises till I could form all the letters and call them by name One evening I wrote out my name in large letters THOMAS JONES This I carried to Jacob in a great excitement of happiness and he warmly commended me for my perseverance and dilligence About this time I was at the store early one morning and thinking I was safe from all danger for a few minutes had seated myself in the back store on one of the barrels to study in my precious spelling book While I was absorbed in this happy enterprise my master came in much earlier than usual and I did not hear him He came directly into the back store I saw his shadow on the wall just in time to throw my book over in among the barrels before he could see what it was although he saw that I had thrown something quickly away His suspicion was aroused He said that I had been stealing something out of the store and he fiercely ordered me to get what I threw away just as he was coming in at the door Without a moment's hesitation I determined to save my precious book and my future opportunities to learn out of it I knew if my book was discovered that all was lost and I felt prepared for any hazard or suffering rather than give up my book and my hopes of improvement So I replied at once to his question that I had not thrown anything away that I had not stolen anything from the store that I did not have anything in my hands which I could throw away when he came in My master declared in high passion that I was lying and ordered me to begin and roll away the barrels This I did but managed to keep the book slipping along so that he could not see it as he stood in the door way He charged me again with stealing and throwing something away and I again denied the charge In a great rage he then got down his long heavy cow hide and ordered me to strip off my jacket and shirt saying with an oath I will make you tell me what it was you had when I came in I stripped myself and came forward according to his directions the same time denying his charge with great earnestness of tone and look and manner He cut me on my naked back perhaps thirty times with great severity making the blood flow freely He then stopped and asked me what I had thrown away as he came in I answered again that I had thrown nothing away He swore terribly said he was certain I was lying and declared that he would kill me if I did not tell him the truth He whipped me the second time with greater severity and at greater length than before He then repeated his question and I answered again as before I was determined to die if I could possibly bear the pain rather than give up my dear book He whipped me the third time with the same result as before and then seizing hold of my shoulders turned me round as though he would inflict on my quivering flesh still another scourging but he saw the deep gashes he had already made and the blood already flowing under his cruel infliction and his stern purpose failed him He said Why Tom I din't think I had cut you so bad and saying that he stopped and told me to put on my shirt again I did as he bade me although my coarse shirt touching my raw back put me to a cruel pain He then went out and I got my book and hid it safely away before he came in again When I went to the house my wounds had dried and I was in an agony of pain My mistress told the servant girl Rachel to help me off with my shirt and to wash my wounds for me and to put on to them some sweet oil The shirt was dried to my back so that it could not be got off without tearing off some of the skin with it The pain upon doing this was greater even than I had endured from my cruel whipping After Rachel had got my shirt off my mistress asked me what I had done for which my master had whipped me so severely I told her he had accused me of stealing when I had not and then had whipped me to make me own it While Rachel was putting on the sweet oil my master came in and I could hear mistress scolding him for giving me such an inhuman beating when I had done nothing He said in reply that Tom was an obstinate liar and that was the reason why he had whipped me But I got well of my mangled back and my book was as still left This was my best my constant friend With great eagerness I snatched every moment I could get morning noon and night for study I had begun to read and Oh how I loved to study and to dwell on the thoughts which I gained from my reading About this time I read a piece in my book about God It said that God who sees and knows all our thoughts loves the good and makes them happy while he is angry with the bad and will punish them for all their sins This made me feel very unhapdy because I was sure that I was not good in the sight of God I thought about this and couldn't get it out of my mind a single hour So I went to James Galley a colored man who exhorted the slaves sometimes on Sunday and told him my trouble asking what shall I do He told me about Jesus and told me I must pray the Lord to forgive me and help me to be good and happy So I went home and went down cellar and prayed but I found no relief no comfort for my unhappy mind I felt so bad that I could not even study my book My master saw that I looked very unhappy and he asked me what ailed me I did not dare now to tell a lie for I wanted to be good that I might be happy So I told master just how it was with me and then he swore terribly at me and said he would whip me if I did not give over praying He said there was no heaven and no hell and that Christians were all hypocrites and that there was nothing after this life and that he would not permit me to go moping round praying and going to the meetings I told him I could not help praying and then he cursed me in a great passion and declared that he would whip me if he knew of my going on any more in that foolish way The next night I was to a meeting which was led by Jack Cammon a free colored man and a class leader in the Methodist Church I was so much overcome by my feelings that I staid very late They prayed for me but I did not yet find any relief I was still very unhappy The next morning my master came in and asked me if I went the night before to the meeting I told him the truth He said didn't I tell you I would whip you if you went nigh these meetings and didn't I tell you to stop this foolish praying I told him he did and if he would why he might whip me but still I could not stop praying because I wanted to be good that I might be happy and go to heaven This reply made my master very angry With many bitter oaths he said he had promised me a whipping and now he should be as good as his word And so he was He whipped me and then forbade with bitter threatenings my praying any more and especially my going again to meeting This was Friday morning I continued to pray for comfort and peace The next Sunday I went to meeting The minister preached a sermon on being born again from the words of Jesus to Nicodemus All this only deepened my trouble of mind I returned home very unhappy Collins a free man of color was at the meeting and told my master that I was there So on Monday morning my master whipped me again and once more forbade my going to meetings and praying The next Sunday there was a class meeting led by Binney Pennison a colored free man I asked my master towards night if I might go out I told him I did not feel well I wanted to go to the class meeting Without asking me where I was going he said I might go I went to the class I staid very late and was so overcome by my feelings that I could not go home that night So they carried me to Joseph Jones's cabin a slave of Mr Jones Joseph talked and prayed with me nearly all night In the morning I went home as soon as it was light and for fear of master I asked Nancy one of the slaves to go up into mistress's room and get the store key for me that I might go and open the store My master told her to go back and tell me to come up I obeyed with many fears My master asked me where I had been the night before I told him the whole truth He cursed me again and said he should whip me for my obstinate disobedience and he declared that he would kill me if I did not promise to obey him He refused to listen to my mistress who was a professor and who tried to intercede for me And just as soon as he had finished threatening me with what he would do he ordered me to take the key and go and open the store When he came into the store that morning two of his neighbors Julius Dumbiven and MacCauslin came in too He called me up and asked me again where I staid last night I told him with his boy Joseph He said he knew that was a lie and he immediately sent off for Joseph to confirm his suspicions He ordered me to strip off my clothes and as I did so he took down the cow hide heavy and stiff with blood which he had before drawn from my body with that cruel weapon and which was congealed upon it Dumbiven professed to be a Christian and he now came forward and earnestly interceded for me but to no purpose and then he left McCauslin asked my master if he did not know that a slave was worth more money after he became pious than he was before And why then he said should you forbid Tom going to meetings and praying He replied that religion was all a damned mockery and he was not going to have any of his slaves praying and whining round about their souls McCauslin then left Joseph came and told the same story about the night before that I had done and then began to beg master not to whip me He cursed him and drove him off He then whipped me with great severity inflicting terrible pain at every blow upon my quivering body which was still very tender from recent lacerations My suffering was so great that it seemed to me that I should die He paused at length and asked me would I mind him and stop praying I told him I could not promise him not to pray any more for I felt that I must and should pray as long as I lived Well then Tom he said I swear that I will whip you to death I told him I could not help myself if he was determined to kill me but that I must pray while I lived He then began to whip me the second time but soon stopped threw down the bloody cow hide and told me to go wash myself in the river just back of the store and then dress myself and if I was determined to be a fool why I must be one My mistress now interceded earnestly for me with my cruel master The next Sabbath was love feast and I felt very anxious to join in that feast This I could not do without a paper from my master and so I asked mistress to help me She advised me to be patient and said she would help me all she could Master refused to give any paper and so I could not join the loving feast the next day On the next Friday evening I went to the prayer meeting Jack Cammon was there and opened the meeting with prayer Then Binney Pennison gave out the sweet hymn which begins in these words Come ye sinners poor and needy Weak and wounded sick and sore I felt that it all applied most sweetly to my condition and I said in my heart I will come now to Jesus and trust in him So when those who felt anxious were requested to come forward and kneel within the altar for prayer I came and knelt down While Jacob Cammon was praying for me and for those who knelt by my side my burden of sorrow which had so long weighed me down was removed I felt the glory of God's love warming my heart and making me very happy I shouted aloud for joy and tried to tell all my poor slave brothers and sisters who were in the house what a dear Saviour I had found and how happy I felt in his precious love Binney Pennison asked me if I could forgive my master I told him I could and did and that I could pray God to forgive him too and make him a good man He asked me if I could tell my master of the change in my feelings I told him I should tell him in the morning And what he asked will you do if he whips you still for praying and going to meeting I said I will ask Jesus to help me bear the pain and to forgive my master for being so wicked He then said Well then Brother Jones I believe that you are a Christian A good many of us went from the meeting to a brother's cabin where we began to express our joy in happy songs The palace of General Dudley was only a little way off and he soon sent over a slave with orders to stop our noise or he would send the patrolers upon us We then stopped our singing and spent the remainder of the night in talking rejoicing and praying It was a night of very great happiness to me The contrast between my feelings then and for many weeks previous was very great Now all was bright and joyous in my relations towards my precious Saviour I felt certain that Jesus was my Saviour and in this blessed assurance a flood of glory and joy filled my happy soul But this sweet night passed away and as the morning came I felt that I must go home and bear the slave's heavy cross I went and told my mistress the blessed change in my feelings She promised me what aid she could give with my master and enjoined upon me to be patient and very faithful to his interest and in this way I should at length wear out his opposiition to my praying and going to meeting I went down to the store in a very happy state of mind I told James my feelings He called me a fool and said master would be sure to whip me I told him I hoped I should be able to bear it and to forgive master for his cruelty to me Master came down talked with me a while and told me that he should whip me because I had disobeyed him in staying out all night He had told me he should whip me if ever I did so and he should make every promise good So I began to take off my clothes He called me a crazy fool and told me to keep my clothes on till he told me to take them off He whipped me over my jacket but I enjoyed so much peace of mind that I scarcely felt the cow hide This was the last whipping that Mr Jones inflicted upon me I was then nearly eighteen years old I waited and begged for a paper to join the Church six months before I could get it But all this time I was cheerful as far as a slave can be and very earnest to do all I could for my master and mistress I was resolved to convince them that I was happier and better for being a Christian and my master at last acknowledged that he could not find any fault with my conduct and that it was impossible to find a more faithful slave than I was to him And so at last he gave a paper to Ben English the leader of the colored members and I joined the love feast and was taken into the Church on trial for six months I was put into Billy Cochran's class At the expiration of six months I was received into the Church in full fellowship Quaker Davis' class I remained there three years My master was much kinder after this time than he had formerly been and I was allowed some more time to myself than I had been before I pursued my studies as far as I could but I soon found the utter impossibility of carrying on my studies as I wished to do I was a slave and all avenues to real improvement I found guarded with jealous care and cruel tenacity against the despised and desolate bondman I still felt a longing desire to improve to be free but the conviction was getting hold of my soul that I was only struggling in vain when seeking to elevate myself into a manly and happy position And now my mind was fast sinking into despair I could read and write and often enjoyed much happiness in poring over the very few books I could obtain and especially at times I found great peace in reading my old worn Testament But I wanted now that hope which had filled my mind with such joy when I first began to learn to read I found much happiness in prayer But here also my mind labored in sadness and darkness much of the time About this time my master was taken sick On Sunday he was prostrated by mortal pains and on Friday the same week he died He left fifteen slaves I was purchased by Owen Holmes for I was then in my twenty third year I had just passed through the darkest season of despairing agony that I had yet known This came upon me in consequence of the visit which I have already described to my dear old desolate home About this time too I entered into a new and distinct period of life which I will unfold in another I will close this period of sorrow and shame with a few lines of touching interest to my mind Who shall avenge the slave I stood and cried The earth the earth the echoing sea replied I turned me to the ocean but each wave Declined to be the avenger of the slave Who shall avenge the slave my species cried The winds the flood the lightning of the sky I turned to these from them one echo ran The right avenger of the slave is man Man was my fellow in his sight I stood Wept and besought him by the voice of blood Sternly he looked as proud on earth he trod Then said the avenger of the slave is GOD I looked in prayer towards Heaven a while 'twas still And then methought God's voice replied I WILL SECOND I enter now upon a new development of wrongs and woes which I as slave was called to undergo I must go back some two or three years from the time when my master died and I was sold to Owen Holmes The bitterness of persecution which master Jones had kept up against me so long because I would try to serve the Lord had passed away I was permitted to pray and to go to our meetings without molestation My master laid aside his terrible severity towards me By his treatment of me afterwards he seemed to feel that he had done me wrong in scourging me as he had done because I could not obey his wicked command to stop praying and to keep a way from the meetings For after the time of my joining the Church he allowed me to go to all the meetings and granted to me many other little favors which I had never before received from him About this time I began to feel very lonely I wanted a friend to whom I could tell my story of sorrows of unsatisfied longing of new and fondly cherished plans I wanted a companion whom I could love with all my warm affections who should love me in return with a true and fervent heart of whom I might think when toiling for a selfish unfeeling master who should dwell fondly on my memory when we were separated during the severe labors of the day and with whom I might enjoy the blessed happiness of social endearments after the work of each day was over My heart yearned to have a home if it was only the wretched home of the unprotected slave to have a wife to love me and to love It seems to me that no one can have such fondness of love and such intensity of desire for home and home affections as the poor slave Despised and trampled upon by a cruel race of unfeeling men the bondman must die in the prime of his wretched life if he finds no refuge in a dear home where love and sympathy shall meet him from hearts made sacred to him by his own irrepressible affection and tenderness for them A nd so I sought to love and to win a true heart in return I did this too with a full knowledge of thy desperate agony that the slave husband and father is exposed to Had I not seen this in the anguish of my own parents Yea I saw it in every public auction where men and women and children were brought upon the block examined and bought I saw it on such occasions in the hopeless agony depicted on the countenance of husband and wife there separated to meet no more in this cruel world and in the screams of wild despair and useless entreaty which the mother then deprived of her darling child sent forth I heard the doom which stares every slave parent in the face each waking and sleeping hour of an unhappy life And yet I sought to become a husband and a father because I felt that I could live no longer unloved and unloving I was married to Lucilla Smith the slave of Mrs Moore We called it and we considered it a true marriage although we knew well that marriage was not permitted to the slaves as a sacred right of the loving heart Lucilla was seventeen years old when we we were married I loved her with all my heart and she gave me a return for my affections with which I was contented Oh God of Love thou knowest what happy hours we have passed in each other's society in our poor cabin When we knelt in prayer we never forgot to ask God to save us from the misery of cruel separation while life and love were our portion Oh how we have talked of this dreaded fate and wept in mingling sorrow as we thought of our desolation if we should be parted and doomed to live on weary years away from each other's dear presence We had three dear little babes Our fondness for our precious children increased the current feeling of love for each other which filled our hearts They were bright precious things those little babes at least so they seemed to us Lucilla and I were never tired of planning to improve their condition as far as might be done for slaves We prayed with new fervency to our Father in heaven to protect our precious babes Lucilla was very proud of me because I could read and write and she often spoke of my teaching our dear little ones and then she would say with tears Who knows Thomas but they may yet be free and happy Lucilla was a valuable slave to her mistress She was a seamstress and very expert at her needle I had a constant dread that Mrs Moore her mistress would be in want of money and sell my dear wife We constantly dreaded a final separation Our affections for each other was very strong and this made us always apprehensive of a cruel parting These fears were well founded as our sorrowing hearts too soon learned A few years of very pure and constant happiness for slaves passed away and we were parted to meet but once again till we met in Eternity Mrs Moore left Wilmington and moved to Newburn She carried with her my beloved Lucilla and my three children Annie four years old Lizzie two and a half years and our sweet little babe Charlie She remained there eighteen months And Oh how lonely and dreary and desponding were those months of lonely life to my crushed heart My dear wife and my precious children were seventy four miles distant from me carried away from me in utter scorn of my beseeching words I was tempted to put an end to my wretched life I thought of my dear family by day and by night A deep despair was in my heart such as no one is called to bear in such cruel crushing power as the poor slave severed forever from the objects of his love by the rapacity of his brother But that dark time of despair passed away and I saw once more my wife and children Mrs Moore left Newburn for Tuscaloosa Ala and passing through Wilmington on her journey she spent one night in her old home That night I passed with my wife and children Lucilla had pined away under the agony of our separation even more than I had done That night she wept on my bosom and we mingled bitter tears together Our dear children were baptized in the tears of agony that were wrung from our breaking hearts May a just God remember that night in the last award that we and our oppressors are to receive The next morning Mrs Moore embarked on board the packet I followed my wife and childen to the boat and parted from them without a word of farewell Our sobs and tears were our only adieu Our hearts were too full of anguish for any other expression of our hopeless woe I have never seen that dear family nor have I heard from them since I parted from them there God only knows the bitterness of my agony experienced in the separation of my wife and children from me The memory of that great woe will find a fresh impression on my heart while that heart shall beat How will the gifted and the great meet the charge against them at the great day as the Judge shall say to them in stern displeasure I was sick destitute imprisoned helpless and ye ministered not unto me for when ye slighted and despised these wretched pleading slaves ye did these acts of scorn against me Depart ye workers of iniquity After my purchase by Owen Holmes I hired my time at per year paid monthly I rented a house of Dr E J Derset I worked loading and unloading vessels that came into Wilmington and could earn from one dollar to a dollar and a quarter a day While my wife and family were spared to bless my home by their presence and love I was comparatively happy But I found then that the agony of the terrible thought I am a slave my wife is a slave my precious children are slaves grew bitter and unsupportable just as the happiness in the society of my beloved home became more distinct and abounding And this one cup of bitterness was ever at my lips Hearts of kind sympathy tender pity did I not drain that cup of bitter woe to its very dregs when my family were carried off into returnless exile and I was left a heartbroken lonely man Can you still be inactive while thousands are drinking that portion of despair every year in this land of schools and Bibles After I parted from my family I continued to toil on but not as I had done before No home was darker than the holds of ships in which I worked Its light the bright joyous light of love and sympathy and mutual endearments was quenched Ah me how dark it left my poor heart It was colder than the winter wind and frost the warm sunshine was snatched away and my poor heart froze in its bitter cold Its gloom was deeper than prison or cave could make it Was not there the deserted chairs and beds once occupied by the objects of a husband's and a father's deep love Deserted How and why The answer is it not the unqualified condemnation of the government and religion of this land I could not go into my cold dark cheerless house the sight of its deserted rooms was despair to my soul So I worked on taking jobs whenever I could get them and worked often till nearly morning and never going to my home for rest till I could toil no more And so I passed four years and I began to feel that I could not live in utter loneliness any longer My heart was still and always yearning for affection and sympathy and loving communion My wife was torn from me I had ceased to hope for another meeting with her in this world of oppression and suffering so I sat down and wrote to Lucilla that I could live alone no longer and saying to her the sad farewell which we could not say when we were sundered I asked Mary R Moore to come and cheer me in my desolate home She became my wife and thank God she has been rescued from slavery by the blessing of God and my efforts to save her She is now my wife and she is with me today and till death parts us secure from the iron hand of slavery Three of our dear children are with us too in the old Commonwealth I cannot say they are in a free land for even here in the city of Boston where I am told is kept the old cradle of liberty my precious children are excluded from the public schools because their skin is black Still Boston is better than Wilmington inasmuch as the rulers of this place permit me to send my children to any school at all After my second marriage I hired my wife of her master and paid for her time a year for three years We had one child while Mary was a slave That child is still in chains The fourth year by the aid of a white friend I purchased my wife for We had before determined to try to accomplish this enterprise in order that our dear babes might be free Besides I felt that I could not bear another cruel separation from wife and children Yet the dread of it was strong and unceasing upon my mind So we made a box and through a hole in the top we put in every piece of money from five cents up to a dollar that we could save from our hard earnings This object nerved us for unceasing toil for twenty months or about that time What hopes and fears beset us as those months wore away I have been compelled to hide that box in a hole dug for it when I knew the patrollers were coming to search my cabin For well do I know if they found my box I should be penniless again How often have I started and turned in sudden and terrible alarm as I have dropped a piece of money into my box and heard its loud ring upon the coin below lest some prowling enemy should hear it and steal from me my boarded treasure And how often have I started up in my sleep as the storm bas beat aloud upon my humble home with the cry of unspeakable agony in my heart Then O God they have taken my box and my wife and babes are still slaves When my box was broken open I still lacked a little of the necessary to buy my wife The kind friend who had promised to aid me in my contemplated purchase made up the deficiency and I became the owner of my wife We had three children at this time and O how my crushed heart was uplifted in its pride and joy as I took them in my arms and thought that they were not slaves After I had purchased my wife we still worked hard and saved our earnings with great care in order to get some property in hand for future use As I saved my earnings I got a white man whom I thought my friend his name I choose to keep for the present to lay it out for me In this way I became the owner of the cabin in which I lived and two other small houses all of which were held in the name of this supposed friend He held them in his own name for me A slave cannot hold property I will here remark that I was deceived by this man and when I ran away from my chains after sending on my family I was compelled to sacrifice the whole of this property I left it because I could not get my own in his hands and come off entirely destitute Thank God I got a way and now I have no tears to shed over the loss of my houses During the winter of a kind lady came and told me that some white men were plotting to enslave my wife and children again She advised me to get them off to the free States as quickly and secretly as possible A lawyer of Wilmington told me they were not safe unless emancipated by a special act of the Legislature He was a member of the House and tried to get through the House a bill for their emancipation But there was so much ill feeling upon this question that he could not do it The Legislature threw it aside at once He then advised me to get them off to the free States as my only course to save them This I determined to do if possible I kept a good look out for a vessel I found one and made a bargain with the captain to take on board for New York a free colored woman and her three children A kind friend gave me a certificate of their freedom to the captain and I brought my wife and children on board at night paid the captain for their fare and staid on the wharf in torturing fear till about sunrise when I saw the vessel under way It was soon out of sight When I went home I threw myself on my knees and poured out my soul to God to carry that ship and its precious cargo safely and swiftly on to a free haven and to guard and guide me soon to a free home with my beloved family And so I kept on praying working hoping pining for neartly three weeks when I received the happy news that my dear ones were safe with a true hearted friend in Brooklyn I had notified him before hand that they were coming and now the good and glorious news came that they were safe with Robert H Cousins where the slaveholder could trouble them no more I had arranged with Mary when she left to come on myself as soon as I could get the money for my houses and land She was to write to me as though she had gone to New York on a visit intending to come back and she was to speak of New York as if she did not like it at all I knew my master would be very angry when he heard she had gone unbeknown to him and thought he would demand to see the letters my wife if she should get friends in New York to write to me for her and so I made ready to meet and quiet his suspicious while I was plotting my own escape For more than three months I tried to get the money or part of it for my houses but was put off and deceived till I found I must come off without a cent of the property I had tried so hard to accumulate I was required to call and see my master every day because he suspected me of a design to run away He was taken suddenly sick and I then started for my wife and children to whom I arrived shortly afterwards WILD TOM OF THE ISLAND RETREAT INTRODUCTION WILD TOM the hero of our story was of unmixed African blood and the slave of Gen Carter He possessed an excellent character for integrity and capability was a devoted and faithful convert to the Methodist persuasion but the suffering he endured through the tyrannical practices of slavery served to harden his heart and eventually to extinguish the light of religion in his soul ANN the wife of Thomas was a pretty sprightly good natured girl whom he loved exceedingly She was whipped to death by Martin an overseer on Gen Carter's plantation ARCHY MOORE was son of Mr Moore his master by a Slave mother He was nearly white in his complexion but yet a crushed Slave FIRST SINCE the death of his wife a remarkable change had taken place in my friend Thomas He had lost his former air of contentment and good nature and had grown morose and sullen Instead of being the most willing and industrious laborer in the field as he used to be he seemed to have imbibed a strong dislike for work and he slighted and neglected his task as much as possible Had he been under any other driver than myself his idleness and neglect would have frequently brought him into trouble But I loved and pitied him and I screened him all I could The wrongs and injuries that had been inflicted upon him since his arrival at Locsahachee seemed to have subverted all the principles upon which he had so long acted It was a subject on which he did not seem inclined to converse and upon which I was unwilling to press him but I had abundent reason to suspect that he had totally renounced the religion in which he had been so carefully instructed and which for so long a time had excercised so powerful an influence over him He had secretly returned to the practice of certain wild rites which in his early youth he had learned from his mother who had herself been kidnapped from the coast of Africa and who had been as he had often told me zealously devoted to her country's superstitions He would sometimes talk wildly and incoherently about having seen the spirit of his departed wife and of some promise he had made to the apparition and I was led to believe that he suffered under occasional fits of partial insanity At all events he was in most respects an altered man He had ceased to be the humble and obedient slave contented with his lot and zealously devoted to his master's service Instead of promoting his master's interest it seemed now to be his study and his aim to do as much mischief as possible There were two or three artful daring unquiet spirits on the plantation from whom till lately he had kept aloof but whose acquaintance he now sought and whose confidence he soon obtained They found him bold and prudent and what was more trusty and magnanimous and they soon gave place to his superiority of intellect and acknowledged him as their leader They were joined by some others whose only motives was the desire of plunder and they extended their depredations to every part of the plantation In this new character Thomas still gave evidence that he was no ordinary man He conducted his enterprises with singular address and when all other stratagems by which to save his companions from detection proved unavailing he had still one resourse that showed the native nobleness of his soul Such was the steady firmness of his mind and the masculine vigor of his constitution that he was enabled to do what few men could He could brave even the torture of the lash a torture I have said already not less terrible than that of the rack itself When every other resourse failed him he was ready to shield his companions by a voluntary confession and to concentrate upon himself a punishment which he knew that some among them were too feeble and faint hearted to endure Magnanimity such as this is esteemed even in a freeman the highest pitch of virtue how then shall we sufficiently admire it in a slave Thank God tyranny is not omnipotent Though it crush its victims to the earth and tread them into the dust and brutify them by every possible invention it cannot totally extinguish the spirit of manhood within them Here it glimmers and there it secretly burns sooner or later to burst forth in a flame that will not be quenched and cannot be kept under So long as I was in the confidence of Mr Martin I was able to render Thomas essential service by informing him of the suspicions plans and stratagems of the overseer It was not long however before I forfeited that confidence not because Mr Martin entertained any suspicion of my playing him false for it was very easy to throw dust in the eyes of so stupid a fellow but because I did not come up to his notions of the spirit and the duty of a driver The season was sickly and as the hands who composed my gang were from a more northern climate and not yet seasoned to the pestiferous atmosphere of a rice plantation they suffered a good deal from sickness and several of them were often unable to work I had explained to Mr Martin and he seemed to be satisfied with my explanation but riding into the field one day in a particularly bad humor and I believe little excited with liquor he got into a towering rage at finding not half my gang in the field and more than half the tasks untouched He demanded the reason I told him that the hands were sick He swore they had no businsss to be sick he was tired he said of this talk about sickness he knew very well it was all sham and he was determined to be imposed upon no longer If any more complaints are made of sickness Archy you have nothing to do but whip the scoundrels and set them to work What said I if they are really sick Sick or not sick I tell you If they are not sick a whipping is no more than they deserve and if they are why nothing is so likely to do them good as a little bloodletting In that case said I you had better appoint another driver I should make but a poor hand at whipping sick people Hold your tongue you damned insolent blackguard Who gave you leave to advise me or dispute my orders Hand me your whip you rascal I did so and Mr Martin thereupon administered upon me a fresh infliction of that same discipline he had bestowed when he first put the whip into my hand So ended my drivership and though I now lost my double allowance and was obliged to turn into the field again and perform my task like the other hands I cannot say that I much regretted it It was a pitiful and sorry office which no one but a scoundrel ever ought to undertake I now united myself more closely to the party of Thomas and joined heart and hand in all their enterprises Our depredations became at last so considerable that Mr Martin was obliged to establish a regular watch consisting of his drivers and a few of their subordinates who kept prowling about the plantation all night and made it unsafe to venture into the fields This arrangement was hastened by a circumstance that happened upon that plantation about which a very strict inquiry was instituted but which led to no definate result On one and the same night General Carter's splendid plantation seat and his extensive rice mills were discovered to be on fire and notwithstanding all efforts to save them both were totally consumed Several of the slaves and Thomas among the rest were put to a sort of torture to make them acknowledge some participation inthis house burning That cruelty availed nothing They all stoutly denied knowing any thing about it I was as I have said very much in Thomas's confidence yet he never spoke to me about that fire As he was one of those men who know how to keep their own secrets I always suspected that he knew much more about the matter than he choose to divulge At all events it was evidently a much more potent feeling than the mere love of plunder by which Thomas was actuated Since his wife's death he sometimes drank to excess but this was seldom and there never was a man more temperate in his meats and drinks or less fistiduous than Thomas generally was He had formerly dressed with much neatness now he neglected his dress altogether He did not love society he had little intercourse with any body except with me and it was not always that he seemed to wish even for my company Thomas had little use for his share of the plunder and in fact he generally distributed it among his companions When the thing was first proposed he seemed to have little inclination to extend our depredations beyond the limits of Loosahachee But as it was no longer safe to continue them there and his companions had rioted too long in plunder to be willing to relinquish it Thomas yielded at last to their urgent solicitations and led us night after night to the neighboring plantations We soon pushed our proceedings so far as to attract the notice of the overseer whose domains we had invaded At first they supposed that the thieves were to be looked for at home and numberless were the severities they exercised upon those whom they suspected But in spite of all their cruelties the depredations were still continued and such was the singular art and cunning which Thomas displayed in varying the scene and manner of our visits that for a long time we escaped all the traps and ambushes that were planned against us We were one night in a rice field and had almost filled our bags when the watchful ear of Thomas detected a sound as if of some one cautiously approaching He supposed it might be the patrol which of late instead of whiling away their time by the help of a fiddle and a bottle of whishey had grown more active and actually performed some of the duties of a night watch Under this impression he gave a signal for us to steal off quietly in a certain order which he had arranged before hand The field was bordered on one side by a deep and wide river from which it was protected by a high embankment We had come by water and our canoe lay in the river under the shade of a clump of bushes and small trees which grew upon the dike One by one we cautionsly stole over the bank carefully keeping in the shade of the bushes and all but Thomas were already in the boat We were waiting for our leader who as usual was the last man in the retreat when we heard several shouts and cries which seemed to indicate that he was discovered if not taken The sound of two musket shots fired in rapid succession increased our terror We hastily shoved the boat from the shore and pushing her into the current of the flood tide which was setting up the river we were carried rapidly and silently out of sight of our landing place The shouts were still continued but they grew fainter and fainter and seemed to take a direction from the river We now put out our paddles and plying with all our strength we pretty soon reached a small cove or creek the place where we kept our boat and at which we were accustomed to embark We drew the canoe on shore and carefully concealed it among the high grass Then without taking out our rice bags and leaving our shoes in the boat we ran towards Loosahachee which we reached without any further adventure I was very anxious about Thomas but I had scarcely thrown myself upon my bed before I heard a light tap at the door of my cabin which I know to be his I sprang up and let him in He was panting for breath and covered with mud Thomas said that just as he was going to climb the embankment he looked behind him and saw two men rapidly approaching They seemed to observe him just at the same moment and called to him to stop If he had attempted to reach the boat it would have drawn them that way and perhaps led to the detection of the whole company The moment they called to him he dropped his riee bag and stooping as low as he could he pushed rapidly through the rice in a direction from the river His pursuers raised a loud shout and fired their muskets at him but without effect He jumped several cross ditches made for the high ground at distance from the river and drew off the patrol in that direction They pursued him closely but as he was very strong and active and well acquainted with the place he succeeded in escaping from among the ditches and embankments of the rice field gained the high grounds and took a direction towards Loosahachee But though he had distanced his pursuers they had still kept upon his track and he expected that they would follow him up and would shortly be arriving While Thomas was telling his adventures he had stripped off his wet clothes and washed off the mud with which he was covered I furnished him with a dry suit which he took with him to his own cabin which was close by mine I hastened round to the cabins of our companions and told them what visitors to expect The barking of all the plantation dogs pretty soon informed us that the patrol were coming They had roused the overseer and with torches in their hands they entered and searched every cabin in the quarter But we were prepared for their visit we were roused with difficulty out of a deep sleep and seemed to be very much astonished at this unseasonable disturbance The search proved to be a very useless one but as the patrol were certain that they had traced the fugitive to Loosahachee the overseer of the plantation upon which we had been depredating came over the next morning to search out and punish the culprit He was accompanied by several other men who it seems were freeholders of the district selected with such forms or rather such neglect of all form as the law of Carolina prescribe in such cases Five Carolina freeholders selected at hap hazard constitute such a court as in most other countries would hardly be trusted with the final adjudication of any matter above the value of forty shillings at the amount A table was set out before the door of the overseer's house some glasses and a bottle of whiskey were placed upon it and the court proceeded to business We were all brought up and examined one after the other The only witnesses were the patrol who had pursued Thomas and they were ordered by the court to pick out the culprits That was rather a difficult matter There were between sixty and seventy men of us the night had been cloudy and without a moon and the patrol had only caught some hasty and uncertain glimpses of the person whom they had followed The court seemed rather vexed at their hesitation Yet perhaps it was not very unreasonable since they were quite unable to agree together as to what sort of a man it was One thought him short the other was certain that he was quite tall The first pronounced him a stout well set fellow the other had taken him to be very slender By this time the first bottle of whiskey was emptied and a second was put on the table The court now told the witnesses that it would not do they did not come up to the mark at all and if they went on at that rate the fellow would escape altogether Just at this moment the overseer of the plantation which had been plundered rode up and as soon as he had dismounted he stepped forward to the relief of the witnesses He said that while the court was organizing he had taken the opportunity to ride over and examine the rice field in which the rogue had been started up It was much trampled in places and there were a great many foot prints but they were all just alike and seemed to have been made by the same person He took a little stick from his pocket on which he said he had carefully marked their exact length and breadth Now this was a trick for detecting people which Thomas understood very well and he had taken good care to be prepared for it Our whole company were provided with shoes of the largest size we could get and all exactly of the same pattern This speech of the overseer seemed to revive the drooping hopes of the judges and they made us all sit down upon the ground and to have our feet measured There was a man on the plantation named Billy a harmless stupid fellow wholly unconnected with us but unluckily for him the only one of all the slaves whose foot corresponded at all with the measure The length of this poor fellow's foot was fatal to him The judges shouted with one voice and in the style of condemnation to be expected from such a court that they would be damned if he was not the thief It was in vain that the poor fellow denied the charge and pleaded for mercy His terror confusion and surprise only served to confirm the opinion of his guilt and the more he denied and the louder he pleaded the more positively his judges were determined against him Without further ceremony they pronounced him guilty and sentenced him to be hung The sentence was no sooner pronounced than preperations were made for its execution An empty barrel was brought out and placed under a tree that stood before the door The poor fellow was mounted upon it the halter was put about his neck and fastened to a limb over his head At first they could get no one willing to act as executioner but after becoming so drunk that they had lost all sense of judical decorum or piety one of them kicked or was rather pushed against the barrel and the poor victim of Carolina justice was launched into eternity The execution over the slaves were sent into the field while Martin with the judges and witnesses and several others whom the fame of the trial had drawn to Loosahachee commenced a regular drunken debauch which they kept up all that day and the night following SECOND The authority of masters over their slaves is in general a continual reign of terror A base and dastard fear is the sole principle of human nature to which the slave holder appeals When it was determined to hang the poor fellow whose fate I have described in the last his judges could not know nor do I suppose they much cared whether he was innocent or guilty Their great object was to terrify the survivors and by an example of what they would denominate wholesome and necessary severity to deter others from any further trespasses upon the neighboring plantations In this they succeeded for though Thomas endeavored to keep up our spirits we were thoroughly scared and felt but little inclination to second his boldness which seemed to grow more determined the more obstacles encountered One of our confederates in particular was so alarmed at the fate of poor Billy that he seemed to have lost all self control and we were in constant fear lest he should betray us When the first paroxysm of his terror was at its height the evening after he had witnessed the execution I believe he would gladly have confessed the whole if he could have found a white man sober enough to listen to him After a while he grew more calm but in the course of the day he had dropped some hints which were carefully treasured up by one of the drivers He reported them as I discovered to the overseer but Mr Martin had not yet recovered from the effects of the frolic and he was too drunk and stupid to understand a word that the driver said to him We had begun to get the better of our fears when a new incident happened which determined us to seek our safety in flight Some persons in passing along the river bank had discovered our canoe which in the hurry of our retreat we had taken too little care to conceal It contained not only our bags full of rice for we had not yet recovered courage enough to go after them but our shoes also all exactly of the same size and corresponding with the measure which had been produced upon the trial Here was ample proof that quite a number had been engaged in the scene of depradation and as one of the company had been raced to Loosachachee it would be reasonable to look for the others upon the same plantation Luckily I obtained an early intimation of this discovery by means of one of the overseer's house servants with whom I had the policy to keep up a pretty intimate connection A man had arrived at the overseer's house his horse dripping with foam and with an appearance of great haste and impatience he had asked to see the overseer The moment he came in the stranger requesed to speak with him alone and Mr Martin took his guest into another room and locked the door The girl who was my spy and informant under an appearance of the greatest simplicity was artful and intelligent and she was prompted to overhear this secret conversation as much by her own curiosity as by the suspicion that it might possibly be something in which I would take an interest She contrived to conceal herself in a closet which was separated from the room in which the overseer and his visitor were conversing only by a thin partition and having overheard his story the substance of which I have already mentioned and learned besides that the court would hold a new session at Loosahachee the day following she hastened to inform me of what she had heard She knew nothing in particular of our affairs but she had reason to believe that this piece of news would not be entirely uninteresting to me I informed Thomas of what she had told me We agreed at once that our best chance of safety was in flight and we immediately communicated our intention and the cause of it to the rest of our confederates They were anxious to accompany us and we all resolved to be off that very night As soon as evening came on we stole away from the plantation and gained the woods in company As we anticipated that a very diligent search would be made for us we though it best to separate Thomas and myself resolved to keep together the others scattered and took various directions As long as the darkness lasted we travelled on as rapidly as we could When the morning began to appear we plunged into a thick swampy piece of woods and having broken down some branches and young trees we made as dry a bed as we were able and lay down to sleep We were much fatigued with our long and rapid journey and slept soundly It was past noon when we waked Our appetites were sharp but we had on provisions Just as we were beginning to consider what course it would be best to pursue we heard the distant baying of a hound Thomas listened for a moment and then exclaimed that he knew that cry It was a famous dog a cross of the blood hound which Mr Martin had long had in training and upon whose performances in tracking out runaways he very much prided himself The place where we were was a thick swamp inwhich it was difficult to move and not easy to stand To cross it would be impossible and we resolved to get into the edge of it where the ground was harder and the undergrowth thinner and to continue our flight We did so but the hound gained rapidly upon us and his baying sounded louder and louder Thomas drew a stout sharp knife which he carried in his pocket We were now just at the border where the dry ground came down upon the swamp and looking behind us across the level and open woods we could see the hound coming on with his nose to the ground and uttering at intervals a deep and savage cry Farther behind but still in full view we saw a man on horseback whom we took to be Mr Martin himself The dog was evidently upon our track and following it to the place where we had first plunged into the swamp he disappeared from our view But we could still hear his clamor which grew louder and almost constant and we soon perceived by the rustling and cracking of the underwood that he was close upon us At this moment we faced about and stood at bay Thomas in front with his knife in hand and I just behind with a sharp and heavy lightwood knot the best indeed the only weapon of which I could avail myself Presently the dog emerged from the swamp The moment he saw us he redoubled his cry and dashed forward foaming at Thomas's throat but only succeeded in seizing his left arm which Thomas raised as a shield against the dog's attack At the same instant he dealt a stroke with his knife which penetrated to the hilt and dog and man came struggling to the ground How the contest would have ended had Thomas been alone is very doubtful for though the hound soon received several wounds they only seemed to increase his ferocity and he still struggled to get at the throat of his antagonist My lightwood knot now did good service Two or three heavy blows upon the dog's head laid him senseless and sprawling on the ground While we had been awaiting the dog's attack and during the contest we had scarcely thought of his master but looking up after it was all over we discovered that Mr Martin was already very near us When the dog took to the swamp and came suddenly upon us before we had expected him He pointed his gun and called upon us to surrender Thomas no sooner saw the overseer than he seemed to lose all his self control and grasping his knife he rushed upon him Mr Martin fired but the buck shot rattled harmlessly among the trees and as he was attempting to wheel his horse Thomas dashed upon him seized him by the arm and dragged him to the ground The horse ran frightened through the woods and it was in vain that I attempted to stop him We looked round in expectation of seeing some others of the huntsmen coming up None were in sight and we seized the opportunity to retreat and to carry our prisoner into the covert of the swamp We learned from him that by the time the court and their attendants arrived at Loosahachee our flight had been discovered and that it was immediately resolved to raise the neighborhood and to commence a general search for the runaways All the horses dogs and men that could be come at were put in requisition They were divided into parties and immediately commenced beating through the woods and swamps in the neighborhood A party of five or six men with Mr Martin and his bloodhound had traced three of our companions into a thick swamp just on the bank of a river The pursuers dismounted and with their guns in their hands they followed the dog into the thicket Our poor fellows was so overcome with fatigue that they slept until the very moment that the hound sprang in upon them He seized one of them by the throat and held him to the ground The others ran and as they ran the pursuers fired One of the fugitives fell dead horribly mangled and cut to pieces with buck shot the other still continued his flight As soon as the dog could be compelled to quit his hold of the man he had seized which was not without difficulty and delay he was put upon the track of the surviving fugitive He followed it to the river where he stood at fault The man had probably plunged in and swam to the other side but as the dog conld not be made to take the water and as the swamp on the opposite bank was reputed to be very soft and dangerous no further pursuit was made the chase in that direction was given up and the poor fellow was suffered to escape for the present The pursuers now separated Two of them undertook to carry back to Loosahachee the captive they had taken and the other three with Mr Martin and his hound were to continue the hunt in search of the rest of us They learned from their captive the place at which we had parted company and the direction which the several parties had taken After beating about for some time the hound struck upon our trail and opened in full cry but the horses of Mr Martin's companions were so broken down that when he began to spur on to keep up with the hound he soon left them behind Mr Martin ended his story by advising us to go in and surrender ourselves giving us his word and honor for it as a gentleman and an overseer that if we would offer him no further violence or injury he would protect us from punishment and reward us most handsomely The sun was now setting The short twilight which follows Carolina sunset would soon be succeeded by the darkness of a cloudy and moonless night and we felt but little apprehension of being immediately troubled by our pursuers I looked at Thomas as if to inquire what we had better do He drew me aside having first examined the fastenings of our prisoner whom we had bound to a tree by some cords found in his own pocket and which were doubtless intended for a very different purpose Thomas paused for a moment as if to collect his thoughts then pointing to Mr Martin Archy he said that man dies to night There was a wild energy and at the same time a steady coolness in the tone in which he spoke It started me at first I made no answer and as meanwhile I looked Thomas in the face I saw there an expression of stern exultation and a fixedness of purpose not to be shaken His eyes flashed fire as he repeated but in a low and quiet tone that contrasted strangely with the matter of his speech I tell you Archy that man dies to night She commands it I have promised it and now the time is come Who commands it I hastily inquired Do you ask who Archy that man was the murderer of my wife Though Thomas and I had lived in great intimacy that was almost the first time since the death of his wife that he had mentioned her to me in such plain terms He had it is true now and then made some distant allusions to her and I recollected that on several occasions before he had dropped some strange and incoherent hints about an intercourse which he still kept up with her The mention of his wife brought tears into his eyes but with his hand he wiped them hastily away and soon recover s missing in the original copy all knowledge of any other runaways or that Wild Tom had any body with him To make all sure eight or ten of the company were sent to patrol on horsebock round the edges of the swamp together with all the dogs but one while five or six of the strongest and most resolute proposed to penetrate the interior and to storm the Island Retreat The prisoner with the rope still about his neck the other end made fast to the waist of one of the stoutest of the company was required to serve as guide and though he protested that he knew nothing in particular of the approaches to the island he was threatened with instant death in case he did not conduct them safely and expeditiously across The fellow however whether through ignorance or design led them into very deep water in some places fairly up to their necks through which they were obliged to wade holding their rifles and powder horns over their heads and in spite of every effort to keep him quiet as the party drew near the island he would insist on crying out as if giving directions as to the passage but as was strongly suspected with the real design of alarming his confederate And indeed before the party could make good their footing on the island he had already taken the alarm and had plunged into the water on the other side He had gained a considerable distance before he was seen and as he dodged behind the great trees of the swamp several rifle shots fired at him failed to take effect In plunged the others in fresh pursuit while the fugitive engrossed by this danger behind made the best of his way through the mud and water till he gained the firm land on the other side of the swamp where he encountered a new danger being seen by one of the scouts patrolling along the edge As he bounded through the piney woods like a deer a rifle shot gazed his side and though it did not bring him down yet it materially checked the swiftness of his flight Four or five horsemen were soon upon his track Snapdragon the overseer leading in the chase soon came up with the flying negro and after vainly calling to him to yield and firing his pistols with only slight effect sprang from his horse and attempted to seize him Snapdragon was a powerful man but he had now found his match Wild Tom exhausted and wounded as he was caught his assailant in his arms and as they rolled upon the ground the negro's knife was not long in finding its way to the overseer's heart But already the dogs and the other pursuers were upon him and before he could disengage himself he was made a prisoner and securely bound It was not long before the whole party was assembled when some of the more violent proposed to revenge the dead overseer by putting the prisoner to death on the spot But the pleasure and glory of making a parade and exhibition of their prize and the necessity too in order to secure the promised reward to identify him as general Carter's runaway had stayed this summary procedure and it had been resolved forthwith to hasten to the village which served as seat of justice for the county to commit the prisoners to jail As soon as an opportunity occurred I handed Tom a calabash of water which was rudely dashed from his hand by one of the slave drivers I felt at that same moment a hand rudely laid on my shoulder while a voice which I recognized as that of the same man who had dashed the calabash of water from Thomas's grasp exclaiming with a volley of oaths What the devil are you doing here in close confab with this murderer I tell you stranger you don't leave here without giving an account of yourself A number of men now rushed up to Thomas and began to unfasten his chains and to conduct him towards the door of the tavern These were the more drunken and infuriated portion of the company who enraged at the sight of the dead overseer wished to try and execute him at once but the others wished to await the arrival of general Carter for whom a messenger had been sent and to delay final proceedings till the prisoner had first been identified as general Carter's property lest otherwise there might be some difficulty in recovering the promised reward The more violent and drunken party had however prevailed A court of three freeholders was now organized on the spot and Thomas again surrounded by a rabble of blacks and whites was now brought before this august tribunal I was myself at the same time taken into custody as a suspected person with an intimation that my case should be attended to as soon as that of the negro was disposed of Whom do you belong to Such was the first question which the honorable court addressed to the prisoner I belong answered Thomas with much solemnity to the God who made us all The mock court after hearing a witness or two pronounced him guilty of the murder of the overseer after which they passed sentence of death A pile of wood was lighted and the victim of slave holding vengeance was placed in the midst of it while he looked upon his persecutors with a smile of contemptuous defiance and his spirit was ushered into the presence of an avenging God 
Josiah-Henson,THE LIFE OF JOSIAH HENSON FORMERLY A SLAVE NOW AN INHABITANT OF CANADA AS NARRATED BY HIMSELF BOSTON ARTHUR D PHELPS verso Entered according to Act of Congress in the year ARTHUR D PHELPS in the office of the Clerk of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts CAMBRIDGE PRINTED BY BOLLES AND HOUGHTON iii ADVERTISEMENT THE following memoir was written from the dictation of JOSIAH HENSON A portion of the story was told which when written was read to him that any errors of statement might be corrected The substance of it therefore the facts the reflections and very often the words are his and little more than the structure of the sentences belongs to another The narrative in this form necessarily loses the attraction derived from the earnest manner the natural eloquence of a man who tells a story in which he is deeply interested but it is hoped that enough remains to repay perusal and that the character of the man and the striking nature of the events of his life will be iv thought to justify the endeavor to make them more extensively known The story has this advantage that it is not fiction but fact and it will be found fruitful in instruction by those who attentively consider its lessons LIFE OF JOSIAH HENSON I WAS born June in Charles County Maryland on a farm belonging to Mr Francis N about a mile from Port Tobacco My mother was the property of Dr Josiah McP but was hired by Mr N to whom my father belonged The only incident I can remember which occurred while my mother continued on N 's farm was the appearance of my father one day with his head bloody and his back lacerated He was in a state of great excitement and though it was all a mystery to me at the age of three or four years it was explained at a later period and I understood that he had been suffering the cruel penalty of the Maryland law for beating a white man His right ear had been cut off close to his head and he had received a hundred lashes on his back He had beaten the overseer for a brutal assault on my mother and this was his punishment Furious at such treatment my father became a different man and was so morose disobedient and intractable that Mr N determined to sell him He accordingly parted with him not long after to his son who lived in Alabama and neither my mother nor I ever heard of him again He was naturally as I understood afterwards from my mother and other persons a man of amiable temper and of considerable energy of character but it is not strange that he should be essentially changed by such cruelty and injustice under the sanction of law After the sale of my father by N and his leaving Maryland for Alabama Dr McP would no longer hire out my mother to N She returned therefore to the estate of the doctor who was very much kinder to his slaves than the generality of planters never suffering them to be struck by any one He was indeed a man of good natural impulses kind hearted liberal and jovial The latter quality was so much developed as to be his great failing and though his convivial excesses were not thought of as a fault by the community in which he lived and did not even prevent his having a high reputation for goodness of heart and an almost saint like benevolence yet they were nevertheless his ruin My mother and her young family of three girls and three boys of which I was the youngest resided on this estate for two or three years during which my only recollections are of being rather a pet of the doctor's who thought I was a bright child and of being much impressed with what I afterwards recognized as the deep piety and devotional feeling and habits of my mother I do not know how or where she acquired her knowledge of God or her acquaintance with the Lord's prayer which she so frequently repeated and taught me to repeat I remember seeing her often on her knees endeavoring to arrange her thoughts in prayers appropriate to her situation but which amounted to little more than constant ejaculation and the repetition of short phrases which were within my infant comprehension and have remained in my memory to this hour After this brief period of comparative comfort however the death of Dr McP brought about a revolution in our condition which common as such things are in slave countries can never be imagined by those not subject to them nor recollected by those who have been without emotions of grief and indignation deep and ineffaceable The doctor was riding from one of his scenes of riotous excess when falling from his horse in crossing a little run not a foot deep he was unable to save himself from drowning In consequence of his decease it became necessary to sell the estate and the slaves in order to divide the property among the heirs and we were all put up at auction and sold to the highest bidder and scattered over various parts of the country My brothers and sisters were bid off one by one while my mother holding my hand looked on in an agony of grief the cause of which I but ill understood at first but which dawned on my mind with dreadful clearness as the sale proceeded My mother was then separated from me and put up in her turn She was bought by a man named Isaac R residing in Montgomery county and then I was offered to the assembled purchasers My mother half distracted with the parting forever from all her children pushed through the crowd while the bidding for me was going on to the spot where R was standing She fell at his feet and clung to his knees entreating him in tones that a mother only could command to buy her baby as well as herself and spare to her one of her little ones at least Will it can it be believed that this man thus appealed to was capable not merely of turning a deaf ear to her supplication but of disengaging himself from her with such violent blows and kicks as to reduce her to the necessity of creeping out of his reach and mingling the groan of bodily suffering with the sob of a breaking heart Yet this was one of my earliest observations of men an experience which has been common to me with thousands of my race the bitterness of which its frequency cannot diminish to any individual who suffers it while it is dark enough to overshadow the whole after life with something blacker than a funeral pall I was bought by a stranger Almost immediately however whether my childish strength at five or six years of age was overmastered by such scenes and experiences or from some accidental cause I fell sick and seemed to my new master so little likely to recover that he proposed to R the purchaser of my mother to take me too at such a trifling rate that it could not be refused I was thus providentially restored to my mother and under her care destitute as she was of the proper means of nursing me I recovered my health and grew up to be an uncommonly vigorous and healthy boy and man The character of R the master whom I faithfully served for many years is by no means an uncommon one in any part of the world but it is to be regretted that a domestic institution should anywhere put it in the power of such a one to tyrannize over his fellow beings and inflict so much needless misery as is sure to be produced by such a man in such a position Coarse and vulgar in his habits unprincipled and cruel in his general deportment and especially addicted to the vice of licentiousness his slaves had little opportunity for relaxation from wearying labor were supplied with the scantiest means of sustaining their toil by necessary food and had no security for personal rights The natural tendency of slavery is to convert the master into a tyrant and the slave into the cringing treacherous false and thieving victim of tyranny R and his slaves were no exception to the general rule but might be cited as apt illustrations of the nature of the case My earliest employments were to carry buckets of water to the men at work to hold a horse plough used for weeding between the rows of corn and as I grew older and taller to take care of master's saddle horse Then a hoe was put into my hands and I was soon required to do the day's work of a man and it was not long before I could do it at least as well as my associates in misery The every day life of a slave on one of our southern plantations however frequently it may have been described is generally little known at the North and must be mentioned as a necessary illustration of the character and habits of the slave and the slave holder created and perpetuated by their relative position The principal food of those upon my master's plantation consisted of corn meal and salt herrings to which was added in summer a little buttermilk and the few vegetables which each might raise for himself and his family on the little piece of ground which was assigned to him for the purpose called a truck patch The meals were two daily The first or breakfast was taken at o'clock after laboring from daylight and the other when the work of the remainder of the day was over The only dress was of tow cloth which for the young and often even for those who had passed the period of childhood consisted of a single garment something like a shirt but longer reaching to the ancles and for the older a pair of pantaloons or a gown according to the sex while some kind of round jacket or overcoat might be added in winter a wool hat once in two or three years for the males and a pair of coarse shoes once a year Our lodging was in log huts of a single small room with no other floor than the trodden earth in which ten or a dozen persons men women and children might sleep but which could not protect them from dampness and cold nor permit the existence of the common decencies of life There were neither beds nor furniture of any description a blanket being the only addition to the dress of the day for protection from the chillness of the air or the earth In these hovels were we penned at night and fed by day here were the children born and the sick neglected Such were the provisions for the daily toil of the slave Notwithstanding this system of management however I grew to be a robust and vigorous lad and at fifteen years of age there were few who could compete with me in work or in sport for not even the condition of a slave can altogether repress the animal spirits of the young negro I was competent to all the work that was done upon the farm and could run faster and farther wrestle longer and jump higher than anybody about me My master and my fellow slaves used to look upon me and speak of me as a wonderfully smart fellow and prophecy the great things I should do when I became a man A casual word of this sort sometimes overheard would fill me with a pride and ambition which some would think impossible in a negro slave degraded starved and abused as I was and had been from my earliest recollection But the love of superiority is not confined to kings and emperors and it is a positive fact that pride and ambition were as active in my soul as probably they ever were in that of the greatest soldier or statesman The objects I pursued I must admit were not just the same as theirs Mine were to be first in the field whether we were hoeing mowing or reaping to surpass those of my own age or indeed any age in athletic exercises and to obtain if possible the favorable regard of the petty despot who ruled over us This last was an exercise of the understanding rather than of the affections and I was guided in it more by what I supposed would be effectual than by a nice judgment of the propriety of the means I used I obtained great influence with my companions as well by the superiority I showed in labor and in sport as by the assistance I yielded them and the favors I conferred upon them from impulses which I cannot consider as wrong though it was necessary for me to conceal sometimes the act as well as its motive I have toiled and induced others to toil many an extra hour in order to show my master what an excellent day's work had been accomplished and to win a kind word or a benevolent deed from his callous heart In general indifference or a cool calculation of my value to him were my reward chilling those hopes of an improvement in my condition which was the ultimate object of my efforts I was much more easily moved to compassion and sympathy than he was and one of the means I took to gain the good will of my fellow sufferers was by taking from him some things that he did not give in part payment of my extra labor The condition of the male slave is bad enough Heaven knows but that of the female compelled to perform unfit labor sick suffering and bearing the burdens of her own sex unpitied and unaided as well as the toils which belong to the other has often oppressed me with a load of sympathy And sometimes when I have seen them starved and miserable and unable to help themselves I have helped them to some of the comforts which they were denied by him who owned them and which my companions had not the wit or the daring to procure Meat was not a part of our regular food but my master had plenty of sheep and pigs and sometimes I have picked out the best one I could find in the flock or the drove carried it a mile or two into the woods slaughtered it cut it up and distributed it among the poor creatures to whom it was at once food luxury and medicine Was this wrong I can only say that at this distance of time my conscience does not reproach me for it and that then I esteemed it among the best of my deeds By means of the influence thus acquired the increased amount of work done upon the farm and by the detection of the knavery of the overseer who plundered his employer for more selfish ends and through my watchfulness was caught in the act and dismissed I was promoted to be superintendent of the farm work and managed to raise more than double the crops with more cheerful and willing labor than was ever seen on the estate before Previous to my attaining this important station however an incident occurred of so powerful an influence on my intellectual development my prospect of improvement in character as well as condition my chance of religious culture and in short on my whole nature body and soul that it deserves especial notice and commemoration There was a person living at Georgetown a few miles only from R's plantation whose business was that of a baker and whose character was that of an upright benevolent Christian man He was noted especially for his detestation of slavery and his resolute avoidance of the employment of slave labor in his business He would not even hire a slave the price of whose toil must be paid to his master but contented himself with the work of his own hands and with such free labor as he could procure His reputation was high not only for this almost singular abstinence from what no one about him thought wrong but for his general probity and excellence This man occasionally served as a minister of the Gospel and preached in a neighborhood where preachers were somewhat rare at that period One Sunday when he was to officiate in this way at a place three or four miles distant my mother persuaded me to ask master's leave to go and hear him and although such permission was not given freely or often yet his favor to me was shown for this once by allowing me to go without much scolding but not without a pretty distinct intimation of what would befall me if I did not return immediately after the close of the service I hurried off pleased with the opportunity but without any definite expectations of benefit or amusement for up to this period of my life and I was then eighteen years old I had never heard a sermon nor any discourse or conversation whatever upon religious topics except what had been impressed upon me by my mother of the responsibility of all to a Supreme Being When I arrived at the place of meeting the services were so far advanced that the speaker was just beginning his discourse from the text Hebrews ii That he by the grace of God should taste of death for every man This was the first text of the Bible to which I had ever listened knowing it to be such I have never forgotten it and scarce a day has passed since in which I have not recalled it and the sermon that was preached from it The divine character of Jesus Christ his life and teachings his sacrifice of himself for others his death and resurrection were all alluded to and some of the points were dwelt upon with great power great at least to me who heard of these things for the first time in my life I was wonderfully impressed too with the use which the preacher made of the last words of the text for every man He said the death of Christ was not designed for the benefit of a select few only but for the salvation of the world for the bond as well as the free and he dwelt on the glad tidings of the Gospel to the poor the persecuted and the distressed its deliverance to the captive and the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free till my heart burned within me and I was in a state of the greatest excitement at the thought that such a being as Jesus Christ had been described should have died for me for me among the rest a poor despised abused slave who was thought by his fellow creatures fit for nothing but unrequited toil and ignorance for mental and bodily degradation I immediately determined to find out something more about Christ and him crucified and revolving the things which I had heard in my mind as I went home I became so excited that I turned aside from the road into the woods and prayed to God for light and for aid with an earnestness which however unenlightened was at least sincere and heartfelt and which the subsequent course of my life has led me to imagine might not have been unacceptable to Him who heareth prayer At all events I date my conversion and my awakening to a new life a consciousness of superior powers and destiny to any thing I had before conceived of from this day so memorable to me I used every means and opportunity of inquiry into religious matters and so deep was my conviction of their superior importance to every thing else so clear my perception of my own faults and so undoubting my observation of the darkness and sin that surrounded me that I could not help talking much on these subjects with those about me and it was not long before I began to pray with them and exhort them and to impart to the poor slaves those little glimmerings of light from another world which had reached my own eye In a few years I became quite an esteemed preacher among them and I will not believe it is vanity which leads me to think I was useful to some I must return however for the present to the course of my life in secular affairs the facts of which it is my principal object to relate The difference between the manner in which it was designed that all men should regard one another as children of the same Father and the manner in which men actually do treat each other as if they were placed here for mutual annoyance and destruction is well exemplified by an incident that happened to me within a year or two from this period that is when I was nineteen or twenty years old My master's habits were such as were common enough among the dissipated planters of the neighborhood and one of their frequent practices was to assemble on Saturday or Sunday which were their holidays and gamble run horses or fight game cocks discuss politics and drink whiskey and brandy and water all day long Perfectly aware that they would not be able to find their own way home at night each one ordered a slave his particular attendant to come after him and help him home I was chosen for this confidential duty by my master and many is the time I have held him on his horse when he could not hold himself in the saddle and walked by his side in darkness and mud from the tavern to his house Of course quarrels and brawls of the most violent description were frequent consequences of these meetings and whenever they became especially dangerous and glasses were thrown dirks drawn and pistols fired it was the duty of the slaves to rush in and each one was to drag his master from the fight and carry him home To tell the truth this was a part of my business for which I felt no reluctance I was young remarkably athletic and self relying and in such affrays I carried it with a high hand and would elbow my way among the whites whom it would have been almost death for me to strike seize my master and drag him out mount him on his horse or crowd him into his buggy with the ease with which I would handle a bag of corn and at the same time with the pride of conscious superiority and the kindness inspired by performing an act of benevolence I knew I was doing for him what he could not do for himself and showing my superiority to others and acquiring their respect in some degree at the same time On one of these occasions my master got into a quarrel with his brother's overseer who was one of the party and in rescuing the former I suppose I was a little more rough with the latter than usual I remember his falling upon the floor and very likely it was from the effects of a push from me or a movement of my elbow He attributed his fall to me rather than to the whiskey he had drunk and treasured up his vengeance for the first favorable opportunity About a week afterwards I was sent by my master to a place a few miles distant on horseback with some letters I took a short cut through a lane separated by gates from the high road and bounded by a fence on each side This lane passed through some of the farm owned by my master's brother and his overseer was in the adjoining field with three negroes when I went by On my return a half an hour afterwards the overseer was sitting on the fence but I could see nothing of the black fellows I rode on utterly unsuspicious of any trouble but as I approached he jumped off the fence and at the same moment two of the negroes sprung up from under the bushes where they had been concealed and stood with him immediately in front of me while the third sprang over the fence just behind me I was thus enclosed between what I could no longer doubt were hostile forces The overseer seized my horse's bridle and ordered me to alight in the usual elegant phraseology used by such men to slaves I asked what I was to alight for To take the cursedest flogging you ever had in your life you d d black scoundrel But what am I to be flogged for Mr L I asked Not a word said he but 'light at once and take off your jacket I saw there was nothing else to be done and slipped off the horse on the opposite side from him Now take off your shirt cried he and as I demurred at this he lifted a stick he had in his hand to strike me but so suddenly and violently that he frightened the horse which broke away from him and ran home I was thus left without means of escape to sustain the attacks of four men as well as I might In avoiding Mr L 's blow I had accidentally got into a corner of the fence where I could not be approached except in front The overseer called upon the negroes to seize me but they knowing something of my physical power were rather slow to obey At length they did their best and as they brought themselves within my reach I knocked them down successively and one of them trying to trip up my feet when he was down I gave him a kick with my heavy shoe which knocked out several of his front teeth and sent him groaning away Meanwhile the cowardly overseer was availing himself of every opportunity to hit me over the head with his stick which was not heavy enough to knock me down though it drew blood freely At length tired of the length of the affray he seized a stake six or seven feet long from the fence and struck at me with his whole strength In attempting to ward off the blow my right arm was broken and I was brought to the ground where repeated blows broke both my shoulder blades and made the blood gush from my mouth copiously The two blacks begged him not to murder me and he just left me as I was telling me to learn what it was to strike a white man The alarm had been raised at the house by seeing the horse come back without his rider and it was not long before assistance arrived to convey me home It may be supposed it was not done without some suffering on my part as besides my broken arm and the wounds on my head I could feel and hear the pieces of my shoulder blades grate against each other with every breath No physician or surgeon was called to dress my wounds and I never knew one to be called to a slave upon R 's estate on any occasion whatever and have no knowledge of such a thing being done on any estate in the neighborhood I was attended if it may be called attendance by my master's sister who had some reputation in such affairs and she splintered my arm and bound up my back as well as she knew how and nature did the rest It was five months before I could work at all and the first time I tried to plough a hard knock of the colter against a stone shattered my shoulder blades again and gave me even greater agony than at first I have been unable to raise my hands to my head from that day to this My master prosecuted Mr L for abusing and maiming his slave and when the case was tried before the magistrate he made a statement of the facts as I have here related them When Mr L was called upon to say why he should not be fined for the offence he simply stated without being put on oath that he had acted in self defence that I had assaulted him and that nothing had saved him from being killed on the spot by so stout a fellow but the fortunate circumstance that his three negroes were within call The result was that my master paid all the costs of court He had the satisfaction of calling Mr L a liar and scoundrel and afterwards of beating him in a very thorough manner for which he had also to pay a fine and costs My situation as overseer I retained together with the especial favor of my master who was not displeased either with saving the expense of a large salary for a white superintendent or with the superior crops I was able to raise for him I will not deny that I used his property more freely than he would have done himself in supplying his people with better food but if I cheated him in this way in small matters it was unequivocally for his own benefit in more important ones and I accounted with the strictest honesty for every dollar I received in the sale of the property entrusted to me Gradually the disposal of every thing raised on the farm the wheat oats hay fruit butter and whatever else there might be was confided to me as it was quite evident that I could and did sell for better prices than any one else he could employ and he was quite incompetent to attend to the business himself For many years I was his factotum and supplied him with all his means for all his purposes whether they were good or bad I had no reason to think highly of his moral character but it was my duty to be faithful to him in the position in which he placed me and I can boldly declare before God and man that I was so I forgave him the causeless blows and injuries he had inflicted on me in childhood and youth and was proud of the favor he now showed me and of the character and reputation I had earned by strenuous and persevering efforts When I was about twenty two years of age I married a very efficient and for a slave a very well taught girl belonging to a neighboring family reputed to be pious and kind whom I first met at the chapel I attended and during nearly forty years that have since elapsed I have had no reason to regret the connection but many to rejoice in it and be grateful for it She has borne me twelve children eight of whom survive and promise to be the comfort of my declining years Things remained in this condition for a considerable period my occupations being to superintend the farming operations and to sell the produce in the neighboring markets of Washington and Georgetown Many respectable people yet living there may possibly have some recollection of 'Siah or Si as they used to call me as their market man but if they have forgotten me I remember them with an honest satisfaction After passing his youth in the manner I have mentioned in a general way and which I do not wish more particularly to describe my master at the age of forty five or upwards married a young woman of eighteen who had some little property and more thrift Her economy was remarkable and was certainly no addition to the comfort of the establishment She had a younger brother Francis to whom R was appointed guardian and who used to complain not without reason I am confident of the meanness of the provision made for the household and he would often come to me with tears in his eyes to tell me he could not get enough to eat I made him my friend for life by sympathizing in his emotions and satisfying his appetite sharing with him the food I took care to provide for my own family After a time however continual dissipation was more than a match for domestic saving My master fell into difficulty and from difficulty into a lawsuit with a brother in law who charged him with dishonest mismanagement of property confided to him in trust The lawsuit was protracted enough to cause his ruin of itself He used every resource to stave off the inevitable result but at length saw no means of relief but removal to another State He often came to my cabin to pass the evening in lamentations over his misfortune in cursing his brother in law and in asking my advice and assistance The first time he ever intimated to me his ultimate project he said he was ruined that every thing was gone that there was but one resource and that depended upon me How can that be master said I in astonishment Before he would explain himself however he begged me to promise to do what he should propose well knowing from his past experience of my character that I should hold myself bound by such promise to do all that it implied if it were within the limits of possibility Solicited in this way with urgency and tears by the man whom I had so zealously served for twenty years and who now seemed absolutely dependent upon his slave impelled too by the fear which he skilfully awakened that the sheriff would seize every one who belonged to him and that all would be separated or perhaps sold to go to Georgia or Louisiana an object of perpetual dread to the slave of the more northern States I consented and promised faithfully to do all I could to save him from the fate impending over him He then told me I must take his slaves to his brother in Kentucky In vain I represented to him that I had never travelled a day's journey from his plantation and knew nothing of the way or the means of getting to Kentucky He insisted that such a smart fellow as I could travel anywhere he promised to give me all necessary instructions and urged that this was the only course by which he could be saved The result was that I agreed to undertake the enterprise certainly no light one for me as it could scarcely be considered for even an experienced manager There were eighteen negroes besides my wife two children and myself to transport nearly a thousand miles through a country I knew nothing about and in winter time for we started in the month of February My master proposed to follow me in a few months and establish himself in Kentucky He furnished me with a small sum of money and some provisions and I bought a one horse wagon to carry them and to give the women and children a lift now and then and the rest of us were to trudge on foot Fortunately for the success of the undertaking these people had been long under my direction and were devotedly attached to me for the many alleviations I had afforded to their miserable condition the comforts I had procured them and the consideration which I had always manifested for them Under these circumstances no difficulty arose from want of submission to my authority and none of any sort except that which I necessarily encountered from my ignorance of the country and my inexperience in such business On arriving at Wheeling I sold the horse and wagon and purchased a boat of sufficient size and floated down the river without further trouble or fatigue stopping every night to encamp I said I had no further trouble but there was one source of anxiety which I was compelled to encounter and a temptation I had to resist the strength of which others can appreciate as well as myself In passing along the State of Ohio we were frequently told that we were free if we chose to be so At Cincinnati especially the colored people gathered round us and urged us with much importunity to remain with them told us it was folly to go on and in short used all the arguments now so familiar to induce slaves to quit their masters My companions probably had little perception of the nature of the boon that was offered to them and were willing to do just as I told them without a wish to judge for themselves Not so with me From my earliest recollection freedom had been the object of my ambition a constant motive to exertion an ever present stimulus to gain and to save No other means of obtaining it however had occurred to me but purchasing myself of my master The idea of running away was not one that I had ever indulged I had a sentiment of honor on the subject or what I thought such which I would not have violated even for freedom and every cent which I had ever felt entitled to call my own had been treasured up for this great purpose till I had accumulated between thirty and forty dollars Now was offered to me an opportunity I had not anticipated I might liberate my family my companions and myself without the smallest risk and without injustice to any individual except one whom we had none of us any reason to love who had been guilty of cruelty and oppression to us all for many years and who had never shown the smallest symptom of sympathy with us or with any one in our condition But I need not make the exception There would have been no injustice to R himself it would have been a retribution which might be called righteous if I had availed myself of the opportunity thus thrust suddenly upon me But it was a punishment which it was not for me to inflict I had promised that man to take his property to Kentucky and deposit it with his brother and this and this only I resolved to do I left Cincinnati before night though I had intended to remain there and encamped with my entire party a few miles below the city What advantages I may have lost by thus throwing away an opportunity of obtaining freedom I know not but the perception of my own strength of character the feeling of integrity the sentiment of high honor I have experienced these advantages I do know and prize and would not lose them nor the recollection of having attained them for all that I can imagine to have resulted from an earlier release from bondage I have often had painful doubts as to the propriety of my carrying so many other individuals into slavery again and my consoling reflection has been that I acted as I thought at the time was best I arrived at Daviess county Kentucky about the middle of April and delivered myself and my companions to Mr Amos R the brother of my owner who had a large plantation with from eighty to one hundred negroes His house was situated about five miles south of the Ohio River and fifteen miles above the Yellow Banks on Big Blackford's Creek There I remained three years expecting my master to follow and employed meantime on the farm of which I had the general management in consequence of the recommendation for ability and honesty which I brought with me from Maryland The situation was in many respects more comfortable than that I had left The farm was larger and more fertile and there was a greater abundance of food which is of course one of the principal sources of the comfort of a slave debarred as he is from so many enjoyments which other men can obtain Sufficiency of food is a pretty important item in any man's account of life but is tenfold more so in that of the slave whose appetite is always stimulated by as much labor as he can perform and whose mind is little occupied by thought on subjects of deeper interest My post of superintendent gave me some advantages too of which I did not fail to avail myself particularly with regard to those religious privileges which since I first heard of Christ and Christianity had greatly occupied my mind In Kentucky the opportunities of attending on the preaching of whites as well as of blacks were more numerous and partly by attending them and the camp meetings which occurred from time to time and partly from studying carefully my own heart and observing the developments of character around me in all the stations of life which I could watch I became better acquainted with those religious feelings which are deeply implanted in the breast of every human being and learnt by practice how best to arouse them and keep them excited how to stir up the callous and indifferent and in general to produce some good religious impressions on the ignorant and thoughtless community by which I was surrounded No great amount of theological knowledge is requisite for the purpose If it had been it is manifest enough that preaching never could have been my vocation but I am persuaded that speaking from the fulness of a heart deeply impressed with its own sinfulness and imperfection and with the mercy of God in Christ Jesus my humble ministrations have not been entirely useless to those who have had less opportunity than myself to reflect upon these all important subjects It is certain that I could not refrain from the endeavor to do what I saw others doing in this field and I labored at once to improve myself and those about me in the cultivation of the harvests which ripen only in eternity I cannot but derive some satisfaction too from the proofs I have had that my services have been acceptable to those to whom they have been rendered In the course of the three years from to I availed myself of all the opportunities of improvement which occurred and was admitted as a preacher by a Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church In the spring of the year news arrived from my master that he was unable to induce his wife to accompany him to Kentucky and he must therefore remain where he was He sent out an agent to sell all his slaves but me and my family and to carry back the proceeds to him And now another of those heart rending scenes was to be witnessed which had impressed itself so deeply on my childish soul Husbands and wives parents and children were to be separated forever Affections which are as strong in the African as in the European were to be cruelly disregarded and the iron selfishness generated by the hateful institution was to be exhibited in its most odious and naked deformity I was exempted from a personal share in the dreadful calamity but I could not see without the deepest grief the agony which I recollected in my own mother and which was again brought before my eyes in the persons with whom I had been long associated nor could I refrain from the bitterest feeling of hatred of the system and those who sustain it What else indeed can be the feeling of the slave liable at every moment of his life to these frightful and unnecessary calamities which may be caused by the caprice of the abandoned or the supposed necessities of the better part of the slaveholders and inflicted upon him without sympathy or redress under the sanction of the laws which uphold the institution I lamented my agency in bringing the poor creatures hither if such was to be the end of the expedition but I could not reproach myself with having made their condition really worse nor with any thing but complying with the commands of a heartless master In the course of the summer of a Methodist preacher a white man of some reputation visited our neighborhood and I became acquainted with him He was soon interested in me and visited me frequently and one day talked to me in a confidential manner about my position He said I ought to be free that I had too much capacity to be confined to the limited and comparatively useless sphere of a slave and though said he I must not be known to have spoken to you on this subject yet if you will obtain Mr Amos's consent to go to see your old master in Maryland I will try and put you in a way by which I think you may succeed in buying yourself He said this to me more than once and as it was in harmony with all my aspirations and wishes was flattering to my self esteem and could be attended with no harm that I could foresee I soon resolved to make the attempt to get the necessary leave Somewhat to my surprise Master Amos made no objection but gave me a pass to go to Maryland and back with some remarks which showed his sense of the value of my services to him and his opinion that I had earned such a privilege if I desired it Furnished with this and with a letter of recommendation from my Methodist friend to a brother preacher in Cincinnati I started about the middle of September for the east By the aid of the good man to whom I had a letter I had an opportunity of preaching in two or three of the pulpits of Cincinnati when I took the opportunity of stating my purpose and was liberally aided in it by contributions made on the spot My friend also procured some subscriptions in the city so that in three or four days I left it with not less than one hundred and sixty dollars in my pocket The annual Methodist Conference was about to be held at Chillicothe to which my kind friend accompanied me and by his influence and exertions I succeeded well there also By his advice I then purchased a suit of respectable clothes and an excellent horse and travelled leisurely from town to town preaching as I went and wherever circumstances were favorable soliciting aid in my great object I succeeded so well that when I arrived at Montgomery county I was master of two hundred and seventy five dollars besides my horse and my clothes My master was surprised to see me dressed and mounted in so respectable a style and I must say my horse was a good one and my clothes better than Mr R 's and he was a little puzzled to understand why I was so long in reaching home for it was now Christmas and he had been informed that I had left Kentucky in September I gave him such an account of my preaching and getting the assistance of friends as while it was consistent with the truth and explained my appearance did not betray to him my principal purpose Amid expressions of an apparently cordial welcome I could discern plainly enough the look of displeasure that a slave should have got possession of such luxuries and he bantered me not a little in his coarse way upon my preaching and my being so speedily converted into a black gentleman He asked for my pass and saw that it was expressed so as to authorize my return to Kentucky He then handed it to his wife and desired her to put it into the desk The manoeuvre was cool but I resolved to manoeuvre too At night I was sent to such quarters as I had been accustomed to long enough the cabin used for a kitchen with its earth floor its filth and its numerous occupants but it was so different from my accommodations in the free States for the last three months and so incompatible with my nice wardrobe that I looked round me with a sensation of disgust that was new to me and instead of going to sleep I sat down and deliberated upon the best plan to adopt for my next proceedings I found my mother had died during my absence and every tie which had ever connected me with this place was broken Strangers were around me here the slaves being those Mrs R had brought to her husband and I had not a friend to consult but Master Frank the brother of R 's wife before mentioned who was now of age and had established himself in business in Washington To him I resolved to go and as soon as I thought it time to start I saddled my horse and rode up to the house It was early in the morning and my master had already gone to the tavern on his usual business but Mrs R came out to look at my horse and equipments Where are you going 'Siah was the natural question I replied I am going to Washington Mistress to see Mr Frank and I must take my pass with me if you please O everybody knows you here you won't need your pass But I can't go to Washington without it I may be met by some surly stranger who will stop me and plague me if he can't do any thing worse Well I'll get it for you she answered and glad was I to see her return with it in her hand and to have her give it to me while she little imagined its importance to my plan My reception by Master Frank was all I expected as kind and hearty as possible He was delighted at my appearance and I immediately told him all my plans and hopes He entered cordially into them with that sympathy which penetrates the heart of a slave as little accustomed as I had been to the exhibition of any such feeling on the part of a white man I found he had a thorough detestation of Mr R whom he charged with having defrauded him of a large proportion of his property which he had held as guardian though as he was still on terms with him he readily agreed to negotiate for my freedom and bring him to the most favorable bargain Accordingly in a few days he rode over to the house and had a long conversation with R on the subject of my emancipation He disclosed to him the facts that I had got some money and my pass and urged that I was a smart fellow who was bent upon getting his freedom and had served the family faithfully for many years that I had really paid for myself a hundred times over in the increased amount of produce I had raised by my skill and influence and that if he did not take care and accept a fair offer when I made it to him he would find some day that I had the means to do without his help and that he would see neither me nor my money that with my horse and my pass I was pretty independent of him already and he had better make up his mind to what was really inevitable and do it with a good grace By such arguments as these Mr Frank not only induced him to think of the thing but before long brought him to an actual bargain by which he agreed to give me my manumission papers for four hundred and fifty dollars of which three hundred and fifty dollars were to be in cash and the remainder in my note My money and my horse enabled me to pay the cash at once and thus my great hopes seemed in a fair way of being realized Some time was spent in the negotiations for this affair and it was not till the th of March that I received my manumission papers in due form of law I was prepared to start immediately on my return to Kentucky and on the th as I was getting ready in the morning for my journey my master accosted me in a very pleasant and friendly manner and entered into conversation with me about my plans He asked me what I was going to do with my freedom certificate whether I was going to show it if I were questioned on the road I told him yes that I supposed it was given to me for that very purpose Ah said he you do not understand the dangers to which you are exposed You may meet with some ruffian slave purchaser who will rob you of that piece of paper and destroy it You will then be thrown into prison and sold for your jail fees before any of your friends can know it Why should you show it at all You can go to Kentucky in perfect safety with your pass Let me enclose that valuable document for you under cover to my brother and nobody will dare to break a seal for that is a State prison matter and when you arrive in Kentucky you will have it all safe and sound This seemed most friendly advice and I felt very grateful for his kindness I accordingly saw him enclose my precious piece of paper in two or three envelopes seal it with three seals and direct it to his brother in Daviess County Kentucky in my care Leaving immediately for Wheeling to which place I was obliged to travel on foot I there took boat and in due time reached my destination I was arrested repeatedly on the way but by insisting always upon being carried before a magistrate I succeeded in escaping all serious impediments by means of my pass which was quite regular and could not be set aside by any responsible authority It so happened that the boat which took me down from Louisville landed me about dark and my walk of five miles brought me to the plantation at bed time I went directly to my own cabin where I found my wife and little ones well and of course we had a good deal to communicate to each other Letters had reached the great house as the master's was always called long before I had arrived telling them what I had been doing and the children of the family had been eager to communicate the great news to my wife how I had been preaching and raising money and making a bargain for my freedom It was not long before Charlotte began to tell me with much excitement what she had heard and to question me about how I had raised the money I had paid and how I expected to get the remainder of the thousand dollars I was to give for my freedom I could scarcely believe my ears but before telling her how the case exactly was I questioned her again and again as to what she had heard She persisted in repeating the same story as she had heard it from my master's letters and I began to perceive the trick that had been played upon me and to see the management by which Isaac R had contrived that the only evidence of my freedom should be kept from every eye but that of his brother Amos who was instructed to retain it till I had made up six hundred and fifty dollars the balance I was reported to have agreed to pay Indignation is a faint word to express my deep sense of such villainy I was without the means of setting myself right The only witness to the truth was my friend Frank who was a thousand miles off and I could neither write to him nor get any one else to do it Every man about me who could write was a slaveholder and what chance had I to be believed or to get evidence to the truth In this dilemma I resolved not to deliver the paper to Amos and told my wife I had not seen it since I was in Louisville It might be in my bag and perhaps it was lost but at all events I did not wish to see it again at present and if she should find it and put it in some place which I did not know it would be the best disposition of it In a few minutes she went out and I remained in ignorance where it was till circumstances presently to be mentioned rendered it necessary for me to have it again The next morning I went up to the house and showed myself to Mr Amos who welcomed me with apparent cordiality and who I have no doubt was really glad to see me as my time and labor were important to him We had a long conversation and after rallying me as his brother had done about my being turned fine gentleman he entered upon the subject of my freedom and told me what Isaac had written to him about the price I was to pay how much I had already made up c I found my wife was right He then asked me if I had not a paper for him I told him I certainly had received something for him of which I had taken the greatest care but that the last time I had seen it was at Louisville and that now it was not in my bag and I did not know what had become of it I could not conceive how it could be lost and yet I could not find it He expressed great concern and sent me back to the landing to see if it had been dropped on the way When the search proved in vain he told me that after all it was of no consequence for whenever I made up the money his brother would renew the paper But said he you have given too much for yourself Isaac has been too hard upon you and I don't see how you are going to get so much in Kentucky All this was very smooth and pleasant to a man who was in a frenzy of grief at the base and apparently irremediable trick that had been played upon him I consoled myself as well as I could and set about my work again with as quiet a mind as I could command resolved to trust in God and never despair Things went on as usual for about a year when one day Mr Amos told me that his brother kept writing to him about his want of money and intimated that perhaps I might be ready to pay another instalment of my price I told him I had nothing as he knew very well and that he never had said what he would allow me or whether he would allow me anything for my labor in his service That put an end to the conversation at the time for he did not like the idea of paying for the labor I had bestowed on his farm the care of his stock and of his people It was not long however before the subject was brought up again and he said Isaac was perpetually telling him he must have money and added that I must get ready to go to New Orleans with his son Amos a young man about twenty one years of age who was going down the river with a flat boat and was nearly ready to start in fact he was to leave the next day and I must go and take care of him and help him dispose of the cargo The intimation was enough Though it was not distinctly stated yet I well knew what was intended and my heart sunk within me at the near prospect of this fatal blight to all my long cherished hopes There was no alternative but death itself and I thought that there was hope as long as there was life and I would not despair even yet The expectation of my fate however produced the degree of misery nearest to that of despair and it is in vain for me to attempt to describe the wretchedness I experienced as I made ready to go on board the flat boat I had little preparation to make to be sure and there was but one thing that seemed to me important I asked my wife to sew up my manumission paper securely in a piece of cloth and to sew that again round my person I thought that having possession of it might be the means of saving me yet and I would not neglect any thing that offered the smallest chance of escape from the frightful servitude that threatened me My wife and children accompanied me to the landing where I bade them an adieu which might be for life and then stepped into the boat which I found manned by three white men who had been hired for the trip Mr Amos and myself were the only other persons on board The load consisted of beef cattle pigs poultry corn whiskey and other articles from the farm and from some of the neighboring estates which were to be sold as we dropped down the river wherever they could be disposed of to the greatest advantage It was a common trading voyage to New Orleans in which I was embarked the interest of which consisted not in the incidents that occurred not in storms or shipwreck or external disaster of any sort but in the storm of passions contending within me and the imminent risk of the shipwreck of my soul which was impending over me nearly the whole period of the voyage One circumstance only I will mention illustrating as other events of my life have often done the counsel of the Saviour He that will be chief among you let him be your servant We were of course all bound to take our trick at the helm in turn sometimes under direction of the captain and sometimes on our own responsibility as he could not be always awake In the daytime there was less difficulty than at night when it required some one who knew the river to avoid sand bars and snags and the captain was the only person on board who had this knowledge But whether by day or by night as I was the only negro on the boat I was made to stand at least three tricks to any other person's one so that from being much with the captain and frequently thrown upon my own exertions I learnt the art of steering and managing the boat far better than the rest I watched the manoeuvres necessary to shoot by a sawyer to land on a bank or avoid a snag or a steamboat in the rapid current of the Mississippi till I could do it as well as the captain After a while the captain had a disease of the eyes by which they became very much inflamed and swollen He was soon rendered totally blind and unable to perform his share of duty This disorder is not an infrequent consequence of exposure to the intense light of the sun doubled as it is by the reflection from the river I was the person who could best take his place and I was in fact master of the boat from that time till our arrival at New Orleans After the captain became blind we were obliged to lie by at night as none of the rest of us had been down the river before and it was necessary to keep watch all night to prevent depredations by the negroes on shore who used frequently to attack such boats as ours for the sake of the provisions on board As I paced backwards and forwards on the deck during my watch it may well be believed I revolved many a painful and passionate thought After all that I had done for Isaac and Amos R after all the regard they professed for me and the value they could not but put upon me such a return as this for my services such an evidence of their utter inattention to my claims upon them and the intense selfishness with which they were ready to sacrifice me at any moment to their supposed interest turned my blood to gall and wormwood and changed me from a lively and I will say a pleasant tempered fellow into a savage morose dangerous slave I was going not at all as a lamb to the slaughter but I felt myself becoming more ferocious every day and as we approached the place where this iniquity was to be consummated I became more and more agitated with an almost uncontrollable fury I had met on the passage with some of my Maryland acquaintance who had been sold off to this region and their haggard and wasted appearance told a piteous story of excessive labor and insufficient food I said to myself If this is to be my lot I cannot survive it long I am not so young as these men and if it has brought them to such a condition it will soon kill me I am to be taken by my masters and owners who ought to be my grateful friends to a place and a condition where my life is to be shortened as well as made more wretched Why should I not prevent this wrong if I can by shortening their lives or those of their agents in accomplishing such detestable injustice I can do the last easily enough They have no suspicion of me and they are at this moment under my control and in my power There are many ways in which I can despatch them and escape and I feel that I should be justified in availing myself of the first good opportunity These were not thoughts which just flitted across my mind's eye and then disappeared They fashioned themselves into shapes which grew larger and seemed firmer every time they presented themselves and at length my mind was made up to convert the phantom shadow into a positive reality I resolved to kill my four companions take what money there was in the boat then to scuttle the craft and escape to the north It was a poor plan may be and would very likely have failed but it was as well contrived under the circumstances as the plans of murderers usually are and blinded by passion and stung to madness as I was I could not see any difficulty about it One dark rainy night within a few days of New Orleans my hour seemed to have come I was alone on the deck Mr Amos and the hands were all asleep below and I crept down noiselessly got hold of an axe entered the cabin and looking by the aid of the dim light there for my victims my eye fell upon Master Amos who was nearest to me my hand slid along the axe handle I raised it to strike the fatal blow when suddenly the thought came to me What commit murder and you a Christian I had not called it murder before It was self defence it was preventing others from murdering me it was justifiable it was even praiseworthy But now all at once the truth burst upon me that it was a crime I was going to kill a young man who had done nothing to injure me but obey commands which he could not resist I was about to lose the fruit of all my efforts at self improvement the character I had acquired and the peace of mind which had never deserted me All this came upon me instantly and with a distinctness which made me almost think I heard it whispered in my ear and I believe I even turned my head to listen I shrunk back laid down the axe crept up on deck again and thanked God as I have done every day since that I had not committed murder My feelings were still agitated but they were changed I was filled with shame and remorse for the design I had entertained and with the fear that my companions would detect it in my face or that a careless word would betray my guilty thoughts I remained on deck all night instead of rousing one of the men to relieve me and nothing brought composure to my mind but the solemn resolution I then made to resign myself to the will of God and take with thankfulness if I could but with submission at all events whatever he might decide should be my lot I reflected that if my life were reduced to a brief term I should have less to suffer and that it was better to die with a Christian's hope and a quiet conscience than to live with the incessant recollection of a crime that would destroy the value of life and under the weight of a secret that would crush out the satisfaction that might be expected from freedom and every other blessing It was long before I recovered my self control and serenity but I believe no one but those to whom I have told the story myself ever suspected me of having entertained such thoughts for a moment In a few days after this tremendous crisis we arrived in New Orleans and the little that remained of our cargo was soon sold the men were discharged and nothing was left but to dispose of me and break up the boat and then Mr Amos would take passage on a steamboat and go home There was no longer any disguise about the purpose of selling me Mr Amos acknowledged that such were his instructions and he set about fulfilling them Several planters came to the boat to look at me and I was sent of some hasty errand that they might see how I could run My points were canvassed as those of a horse would have been and doubtless some account of my human faculties was thrown into the discussion of the bargain that my value as a domestic animal might be enhanced Amos had talked with apparent kindness about getting me a good master who would employ me as a coachman or as a house servant but as time passed on I could discern no particular effort of the kind At length every thing was wound up but this single affair The boat was to be sold and I was to be sold the next day and Amos was to set off on his return at six o'clock in the afternoon I could not sleep that night which seemed long enough to me though it was one of the shortest in the year The slow way in which we had come down had brought us to the long days and the heat of June and everybody knows what the climate of New Orleans is at that time of the year A little before daylight master Amos awoke indisposed His stomach was disordered but he lay down again thinking it would pass off In a little while he was up again and felt more sick than before and it was soon evident that the river fever was upon him He became rapidly worse and by eight o'clock in the morning he was utterly prostrate his head was on my lap and he was begging me to help him to do something for him to save him The tables were turned He was now rather more dependent upon me than I had been upon him the day before He entreated me to despatch matters to sell the flat boat in which we two had been living by ourselves for some days and to get him and his trunk containing the proceeds of the trip on board the steamer as quick as possible and especially not to desert him so long as he lived nor to suffer his body if he died to be thrown into the river I attended to all his requests and by twelve o'clock that day he was in one of the cabins of the steamer appropriated to sick passengers All was done which could be done for the comfort and relief of any one in such a desperate condition But he was reduced to extremity He ceased to grow worse after a day or two and he must speedily have died if he had not but his strength was so entirely gone that he could neither speak nor move a limb and could only indicate his wish for a teaspoonful of gruel or something to moisten his throat by a feeble motion of his lips I nursed him carefully and constantly Nothing else could have saved his life It hung by a thread for a long time We were as much as twelve days in reaching home for the water was low at that season particularly in the Ohio river and when we arrived at our landing he was still unable to speak and could only be moved on a sheet or a litter Something of this sort was soon fixed up at the landing on which he could be carried to the house which was five miles off and I got a party of the slaves belonging to the estate to form relays for the purpose As we approached the house the surprise at seeing me back again and the perplexity to imagine what I was bringing along with such a party were extreme but the discovery was soon made which explained the strange appearance and the grief of father and mother and brothers and sisters made itself seen and heard Loud and long were the lamentations over poor Amos and when the family came a little to themselves great were the commendations bestowed upon me for my care of him and of the property We arrived home about the tenth of July but it was not till the middle of August that Amos was well enough to move out of his chamber though he had been convalescent all the while As soon as he could speak he told all I had done for him and said If I had sold him I should have died but it never seemed to occur to him or the rest of the family that they were under any the slightest obligation to me on that account I had done well as a slave and to have it acknowledged and to be praised for it was compensation enough for me My merits whatever they were instead of exciting sympathy or any feeling of attachment to me seemed only to enhance my money value to them This was not the view which I took of the case myself and as soon as Amos began to recover I began to meditate upon a plan of escape from the danger in which I constantly stood of a repetition of the attempt to sell me in the highest market Providence seemed to have interfered once to defeat the scheme but I could not expect such extraordinary circumstances to be repeated and I was bound to do every thing in my power to secure myself and my family from the wicked conspiracy of Isaac and Amos R against my life as well as against my natural rights in my own person and those which I had acquired under even the barbarous laws of slavery by the money I had paid for myself If Isaac would only have been honest enough to adhere to his own bargain I would have adhered to mine and paid him all I had promised But his attempt to kidnap me again after having pocketed three fourths of my market value absolved me from all obligation in my opinion to pay him any more or to continue in a position which exposed me to his machinations I determined to make my escape to Canada about which I had heard something as beyond the limits of the United States for notwithstanding there were free States in the Union I felt that I should be safer under an entirely foreign jurisdiction The slave States had their emissaries in the others and I feared that I might fall into their hands and need a stronger protection than might be afforded me by public opinion in the northern States at that time It was not without long thought on the subject that I devised a plan of escape but when I had fully made up my mind I communicated my intention to my wife who was too much terrified by the dangers of the attempt to do any thing at first but endeavor to dissuade me from it and try to make me contented with my condition as it was In vain I explained to her the liability we were in of being separated from our children as well as from each other and presented every argument which had weighed with my own mind and had at last decided me She had not gone through my trials and female timidity overcame her sense of the evils she had experienced I argued the matter with her at various times till I was satisfied that argument alone would not prevail and then I said to her very deliberately that though it was a cruel thing for me to part with her yet I would do it and take all the children with me but the youngest rather than run the risk of forcible separation from them all and of a much worse captivity besides which we were constantly exposed to here She wept and entreated but found I was resolute and after a whole night spent in talking over the matter I left her to go to my work for the day I had not gone far when I heard her voice calling me I waited till she came up to me and then finding me as determined as ever she said at last she would go with me It was an immense relief to my nerves and my tears flowed as fast as her's had done before I rode off with a heart a good deal lighter She was living at the time near the landing I have mentioned for the plantation extended the whole five miles from the house to the river and there were several different farms all of which I was overseeing and therefore riding about from one to another every day The oldest boy was at the house with Master Amos the rest were all with her Her consent was given on Thursday morning and on the night of the following Saturday I had decided to set out as it would then be several days before I should be missed and I should get a good start Some time previously I had got my wife to make me a large knapsack big enough to hold the two smallest children and I had arranged it that she should lead the second boy while the oldest was stout enough to go by himself and to help me carry the necessary food I used to pack the little ones on my back of an evening after I had got through my day's work and trot round the cabin with them and go some little distance from it in order to accustom both them and myself to the task before us At length the eventful night came I went up to the house to ask leave to take Tom home with me that he might have his clothes mended No objection was made and I bade Master Amos good night for the last time It was about the middle of September and by nine o'clock in the evening all was ready It was a dark moonless night and we got into the little skiff in which I had induced a fellow slave to take us across the river It was an agitating and solemn moment The good fellow who was rowing us over said this affair might end in his death but said he you will not be brought back alive will you Not if I can help it I answered And if you are overpowered and return he asked will you conceal my part of the business That I will so help me God I replied Then I am easy he answered and wish you success We landed on the Indiana shore and I began to feel that I was my own master But in what circumstances of fear and misery still We were to travel by night and rest by day in the woods and bushes We were thrown absolutely upon our own poor and small resources and were to rely on our own strength alone The population was not so numerous as now nor so well disposed to the slave We dared look to no one for help But my courage was equal to the occasion and we trudged on cautiously and steadily and as fast as the darkness and the feebleness of my wife and boys would allow It was nearly a fortnight before we reached Cincinnati and a day or two previous to getting there our provisions were used up and I had the misery to hear the cry of hunger and exhaustion from those I loved so dearly It was necessary to run the risk of exposure by day light upon the road so I sprung upon it boldly from our hiding place one morning and turned towards the south to prevent the suspicion of my going the other way I approached the first house I saw and asked if they would sell me a little bread and meat No they had nothing for black fellows At the next I succeeded better but had to make as good a bargain as I could and that was not very successful with a man who wanted to see how little he could give me for my quarter of a dollar As soon as I had succeeded in making a purchase I followed the road still towards the south till I got out of sight of the house and then darted into the woods again and returned northward just out of sight of the road The food which I bought such as it was put new life and strength into my wife and children when I got back to them again and we at length arrived safe at Cincinnati There we were kindly received and entertained for several days my wife and little ones were refreshed and then we were carried on our way thirty miles in a wagon We followed the same course as before of travelling by night and resting by day till we arrived at the Scioto where we had been told we should strike the military road of General Hull in the last war with Great Britain and might then safely travel by day We found the road accordingly by the large sycamore and elm which marked its beginning and entered upon it with fresh spirits early in the day Nobody had told us that it was cut through the wilderness and I had neglected to provide any food thinking we should soon come to some habitation where we could be supplied But we travelled on all day without seeing one and laid down at night hungry and weary enough I thought I heard the howling of wolves and the terror inspired by this and the exertions I used to keep them off by making as much noise as I could took away all power of sleeping till day light and rendered a little delay inevitable In the morning we were as hungry as ever but had nothing to relieve our appetites but a little piece of dried beef I divided some of this all round and then started for a second day's trip in the wilderness It was a hard trial and this day is a memorable one in my life The road was rough of course being neglected and the logs lying across it constantly the underbrush was somewhat cleared away and that was about all to mark the track As we went wearily on I was a little ahead of my wife and the boys when I heard them call to me and turning round saw that my wife had fallen over a log and was prostrate on the ground Mother's dying cried Tom and when I reached her it seemed really so She had fainted I did not know but it might be fatal and was half distracted with the fear and the uncertainty In a few minutes however she recovered sufficiently to take a few mouthfuls of the beef and this with a little rest revived her so much that she bravely set out once more We had not gone far and I suppose it was about three o'clock in the afternoon when we discerned some persons approaching us at no great distance We were instantly on the alert as we could hardly expect them to be friends The advance of a few paces showed me they were Indians with packs on their shoulders and they were so near that if they were hostile it would be useless to try to escape So I walked along boldly till we came close upon them They were bent down with their burdens and had not raised their eyes till now and when they did so and saw me coming towards them they looked at me in a frightened sort of way for a moment and then setting up a peculiar howl turned round and ran as fast as they could There were three or four of them and what they were afraid of I could not imagine unless they supposed I was the devil whom they had perhaps heard of as black But even then one would have thought my wife and children might have reassured them However there was no doubt they were well frightened and we heard their wild and prolonged howl as they ran for a mile or more My wife was alarmed too and thought they were merely running back to collect more of a party and then to come and murder us and she wanted to turn back I told her they were numerous enough to do that if they wanted to without help and that as for turning back I had had quite too much of the road behind us and that it would be a ridiculous thing that both parties should run away If they were disposed to run I would follow We did follow on and soon the noise was stopped and as we advanced we could discover Indians peeping at us from behind the trees and dodging out of our sight if they thought we were looking at them Presently we came upon their wigwams and saw a fine looking stately Indian with his arms folded waiting for us to approach He was apparently the chief and saluting us civilly he soon discovered that we were human beings and spoke to his young men who were scattered about and made them come in and give up their foolish fears And now curiosity seemed to prevail Each one wanted to touch the children who were shy as partridges with their long life in the woods and as they shrunk away and uttered a little cry of alarm the Indian would jump back too as if he thought they would bite him However a little while sufficed to make them understand what we were and whither we were going and what we needed and as little to set them about supplying our wants feeding us bountifully and giving us a comfortable wigwam for our night's rest The next day we resumed our march and found from the Indians that we were only about twenty five miles from the lake They sent some of their young men to point out the place where we were to turn off and parted from us with as much kindness as possible In passing over the part of Ohio near the lake where such an extensive plain is found we came to a spot overflowed by a stream across which the road passed I forded it first with the help of a sounding pole and then taking the children on my back first the two little ones and then the others one at a time and lastly my wife I succeeded in getting them all safely across where the ford was one hundred to one hundred and fifty yards wide and the deepest part perhaps four feet deep At this time the skin was worn from my back to an extent almost equal to the size of my knapsack One night more was passed in the woods and in the course of the next forenoon we came out upon the wide plain without trees which lies south and west of Sandusky city We saw the houses of the village and kept away from them for the present till I should have an opportunity to reconnoitre a little When about a mile from the lake I hid my companions in the bushes and pushed forward Before I had gone far I observed on the left on the opposite side from the town something which looked like a house between which and a vessel a number of men were passing and repassing with activity I promptly decided to approach them and as I drew near I was hailed by one of the number who asked me if I wanted to work I told him yes and it was scarcely a minute before I had hold of a bag of corn which like the rest I emptied into the hold of the vessel lying at anchor a few rods off I got into the line of laborers hurrying along the plank next to the only colored man I saw engaged and soon entered into conversation with him in the course of which I inquired of him where they were going the best route to Canada who was the captain and other particulars interesting to me and communicated to him where I came from and whither I wished to go He told the captain who called me one side and by his frank look and manner soon induced me to acknowledge my condition and purpose I found I had not mistaken him He sympathized with me at once most heartily and offered to take me and my family to Buffalo whither they were bound and where they might arrive the next evening if the favorable wind continued of which they were hurrying to take advantage Never did men work with a better will and soon two or three hundred bushels were thrown on board the hatches were fastened down the anchor raised and the sails hoisted The captain had agreed to send a boat for me after sundown rather than take me on board at the landing as there were Kentucky spies he said on the watch for slaves at Sandusky who might get a glimpse of me if I brought my party out of the bush by daylight I watched the vessel as she left her moorings with intense interest and began to fear that she would go without me after all she stretched off to so great a distance as it seemed to me before she rounded to At length however I saw her come up to the wind and lower a boat for the shore and in a few minutes my black friend and two sailors jumped out upon the beach They went with me immediately to bring my wife and children But what was my alarm when I came back to the place where I had left them to find they had gone For a moment my fears were overpowering but I soon discerned them in the fading twilight at no great distance My wife had been alarmed by my long absence and thought I must have been discovered by some of our watchful enemies and had given up all for lost Her fears were not removed by seeing me returning with three other men and she tried to hide herself It was not without difficulty that I satisfied her all was right for her agitation was so great that she could not at once understand what I said However this was soon over and the kindness of my companions facilitated the matter very much Before long we were all on the way to the boat and it did not require much time or labor to embark our luggage A short row brought us to the vessel and to my astonishment we were welcomed on board with three hearty cheers for the crew were as much pleased as the captain with the help they were giving us to escape A fine run brought us to Buffalo the next evening but it was too late to cross the river that night The next morning we dropped down to Black Rock and the friendly captain whose name I have gratefully remembered as Captain Burnham put us on board the ferry boat to Waterloo paid the passage money and gave me a dollar at parting He was a Scotchman and had done enough to win my enduring gratitude to prove himself a kind and generous man and to give me a pleasant association with his dialect and his country When I got on the Canada side on the morning of the th of October my first impulse was to throw myself on the ground and giving way to the riotous exultation of my feelings to execute sundry antics which excited the astonishment of those who were looking on A gentleman of the neighborhood Colonel Warren who happened to be present thought I was in a fit and as he inquired what was the matter with the poor fellow I jumped up and told him I was free O said he with a hearty laugh is that it I never knew freedom make a man roll in the sand before It is not much to be wondered at that my certainty of being free was not quite a sober one at the first moment and I hugged and kissed my wife and children all round with a vivacity which made them laugh as well as myself There was not much time to be lost though in frolic even at this extraordinary moment I was a stranger in a strange land and had to look about me at once for refuge and resource I found a lodging for the night and the next morning set about exploring the interior for the means of support I knew nothing about the country or the people but kept my eyes and ears open and made such inquiries as opportunity afforded I heard in the course of the day of a Mr Hibbard who lived some six or seven miles off and who was a rich man as riches were counted there with a large farm and several small tenements on it which he was in the habit of letting to his laborers To him I went immediately though the character given him by his neighbors was not by any means unexceptionably good But I thought he was not probably any worse than those I had been accustomed to serve and that I could get along with him if honest and faithful work would satisfy him In the afternoon I found him and soon struck a bargain with him for employment I asked him if there was any house where he would let me live He said yes and led the way to an old two story sort of shanty into the lower story of which the pigs had broken and had apparently made it their resting place for some time Still it was a house and I forthwith expelled the pigs and set about cleaning it for the occupancy of a better sort of tenants With the aid of hoe and shovel hot water and a mop I got the floor into a tolerable condition by midnight and only then did I rest from my labor The next day I brought the rest of the Hensons to my house and though there was nothing there but bare walls and floors we were all in a state of great delight and my old woman laughed and acknowledged that it was worth while and that it was better than a log cabin with an earth floor I begged some straw of Mr Hibbard and confining it by logs in the corners of the room I made beds of it three feet thick upon which we reposed luxuriously after our long fatigues Another trial awaited me which I had not anticipated In consequence of the great exposures we had gone through my wife and all the children fell sick and it was not without extreme peril that they escaped with their lives My employer soon found that my labor was of more value to him than that of those he was accustomed to hire and as I consequently gained his favor and his wife took quite a fancy to mine we soon procured some of the comforts of life while the necessaries of food and fuel were abundant I remained with Mr Hibbard three years sometimes working on shares and sometimes for wages and I managed in that time to procure some pigs a cow and a horse Thus my condition gradually improved and I felt that my toils and sacrifices for freedom had not been in vain Nor were my labors for the improvement of myself and others in more important things than food and clothing without effect It so happened that one of my Maryland friends arrived in this neighborhood and hearing of my being here inquired if I ever preached now and spread the reputation I had acquired elsewhere for my gifts in the pulpit I had said nothing myself and had not intended to say any thing of my having ever officiated in that way I went to meeting with others when I had an opportunity and enjoyed the quiet of the Sabbath when there was no assembly I would not refuse to labor in this field however when desired to do so and I hope it is no violation of modesty to state the fact that I was frequently called upon not by blacks alone but by all classes in my vicinity the comparatively educated as well as the lamentably ignorant to speak to them on their duty responsibility and immortality on their obligations to their Maker their Saviour and themselves It may nay I am aware it must seem strange to many that a man so ignorant as myself unable to read and having heard so little as I had of religion natural or revealed should be able to preach acceptably to persons who had enjoyed greater advantages than myself I can explain it only by reference to our Saviour's comparison of the kingdom of heaven to a plant which may spring from a seed no bigger than a mustard seed and may yet reach such a size that the birds of the air may take shelter therein Religion is not so much knowledge as wisdom and observation upon what passes without and reflection upon what passes within a man's heart will give him a larger growth in grace than is imagined by the devoted adherents of creeds or the confident followers of Christ who call him Lord Lord but do not the things which he says Mr Hibbard was good enough to give my eldest boy Tom two quarters' schooling to which the schoolmaster added more of his own kindness so that my boy learned to read fluently and well It was a great advantage not only to him but to me for I used to get him to read much to me in the Bible especially on Sunday mornings when I was going to preach and I could easily commit to memory a few verses or a from hearing him read it over One beautiful summer Sabbath I rose early and called him to come and read to me Where shall I read father Anywhere my son I answered for I knew not how to direct him He opened upon Psalm ciii Bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name and as he read this beautiful outpouring of gratitude which I now first heard my heart melted within me I recalled with all the rapidity of which thought is capable the whole current of my life and as I remembered the dangers and afflictions from which the Lord had delivered me and compared my present condition with what it had been not only my heart but my eyes overflowed and I could neither check nor conceal the emotion which overpowered me The words Bless the Lord O my soul with which the Psalm begins and ends were all I needed or could use to express the fulness of my thankful heart When he had finished Tom turned to me and asked Father who was David He had observed my excitement and added He writes pretty don't he and then repeated his question It was a question I was utterly unable to answer I had never heard of David but could not bear to acknowledge my ignorance to my own child So I answered evasively He was a man of God my son I suppose so said he but I want to know something more about him Where did he live What did he do As he went on questioning me I saw it was in vain to attempt to escape and so I told him frankly I did not know Why father said he can't you read This was a worse question than the other and if I had any pride in me at the moment it took it all out of me pretty quick It was a direct question and must have a direct answer so I told him at once I could not Why not said he Because I never had an opportunity to learn nor anybody to teach me Well you can learn now father No my son I am too old and have not time enough I must work all day or you would not have enough to eat Then you might do it at night But still there is nobody to teach me I can't afford to pay anybody for it and of course no one can do it for nothing Why father I'll teach you I can do it I know And then you'll know so much more that you can talk better and preach better The little fellow was so earnest there was no resisting him but it is hard to describe the conflicting feelings within me at such a proposition from such a quarter I was delighted with the conviction that my children would have advantages I had never enjoyed but it was no slight mortification to think of being instructed by a child of twelve years old Yet ambition and a true desire to learn for the good it would do my own mind conquered the shame and I agreed to try But I did not reach this state of mind instantly I was greatly moved by the conversation I had had with Tom so much so that I could not undertake to preach that day The congregation were disappointed and I passed the Sunday in solitary reflection in the woods I was too much engrossed with the multitude of my thoughts within me to return home to dinner and spent the whole day in secret meditation and prayer trying to compose myself and ascertain my true position It was not difficult to see that my predicament was one of profound ignorance and that I ought to use every opportunity of enlightening it I began to take lessons of Tom therefore immediately and followed it up every evening by the light of a pine knot or some hickory bark which was the only light I could afford Weeks passed and my progress was so slow that poor Tom was almost discouraged and used to drop asleep sometimes and whine a little over my dulness and talk to me very much as a schoolmaster talks to a stupid boy till I began to be afraid that my age my want of practice in looking at such little scratches the daily fatigue and the dim light would be effectual preventives of my ever acquiring the art of reading But Tom's perseverance and mine conquered at last and in the course of the winter I did really learn to read a little It was and has been ever since a great comfort to me to have made this acquisition though it has made me comprehend better the terrible abyss of ignorance in which I had been plunged all my previous life It made me also feel more deeply and bitterly the oppression under which I had toiled and groaned but the crushing and cruel nature of which I had not appreciated till I found out in some slight degree from what I had been debarred At the same time it made me more anxious than before to do something for the rescue and the elevation of those who were suffering the same evils I had endured and who did not know how degraded and ignorant they really were After about three years had passed I improved my condition again by taking service with a gentleman by the name of Riseley whose residence was only a few miles distant and who was a man of more elevation of mind than Mr Hibbard and of superior abilities At his place I began to reflect more and more upon the circumstances of the blacks who were already somewhat numerous in this region I was not the only one who had escaped from the States and had settled on the first spot in Canada which they had reached Several hundreds of colored persons were in the neighborhood and in the first joy of their deliverance were going on in a way which I could see led to little or no progress in improvement They were content to have the proceeds of their labor at their own command and had not the ambition for or the perception of what was within their easy reach if they did but know it They were generally working for hire upon the lands of others and had not yet dreamed of becoming independent proprietors themselves It soon became my great object to awaken them to a sense of the advantages which offered themselves to their grasp and Mr Riseley seeing clearly the justness of my views and willing to co perate with me in the attempt to make them generally known among the blacks permitted me to call meetings at his house of those who were known to be among the most intelligent and successful of our class At these meetings we considered and discussed the subject till we were all of one mind and it was agreed among the ten or twelve of us who assembled at them that we would invest our earnings in land and undertake the task which though no light one certainly would yet soon reward us for our effort of settling upon wild lands which we could call our own and where every tree which we felled and every bushel of corn we raised would be for ourselves in other words where we could secure all the profits of our own labor The advantages of this course need not be dwelt upon in a country which is every day exemplifying it and has done so for two hundred years and more and has by this very means acquired an indestructible character for energy enterprise and self reliance It was precisely the Yankee spirit which I wished to instil into my fellow slaves if possible and I was not deterred from the task by the perception of the immense contrast in all the habits and character generated by long ages of freedom and servitude activity and sloth independence and subjection My associates agreed with me and we resolved to select some spot among the many offered to our choice where we would colonize and raise our own crops eat our own bread and be in short our own masters I was deputed to explore the country and find a place to which I would be willing to migrate myself and they all said they would go with me whenever such a one should be found I set out accordingly in the autumn of and travelled on foot all over the extensive region between lakes Ontario Erie and Huron When I came to the territory east of Lake St Clair and Detroit River I was strongly impressed with its fertility its convenience and indeed its superiority for our purposes to any other spot I had seen I determined this should be the place and so reported on my return to my future companions They were wisely cautious however and sent me off again in the summer that I might see it at the opposite seasons of the year and be better able to judge of its advantages I found no reason to change my opinion but upon going further towards the head of Lake Erie I discovered an extensive tract of government land which for some years had been granted to a Mr McCormick upon certain conditions and which he had rented out to settlers upon such terms as he could obtain This land being already cleared offered some advantages for the immediate raising of crops which were not to be overlooked by persons whose resources were so limited as ours and we determined to go there first for a time and with the proceeds of what we could earn there to make our purchases in Dawn afterwards This plan was followed and some dozen or more of us settled upon these lands the following spring and accumulated something by the crops of wheat and tobacco we were able to raise I discovered before long that McCormick had not complied with the conditions of his grant and was not therefore entitled to the rent he exacted from settlers I was advised by Sir John Cockburn to whom I applied on the subject to appeal to the legislature for relief We did so and though McCormick was able by the aid of his friends to defeat us for one year yet we succeeded the next upon a second appeal and were freed from all rent thereafter so long as we remained Still this was not our own land The government though it demanded no rent might set up the land for sale at any time and then we should probably be driven off by wealthier purchasers with the entire loss of all our improvements and with no retreat provided It was manifest that it was altogether better for us to purchase before competition was invited and we kept this fully in mind during the time we staid here We remained in this position six or seven years and all this while the colored population was increasing rapidly around us and spreading very fast into the interior settlements and the large towns The immigration from the United States was incessant and some I am not unwilling to admit were brought hither with my knowledge and connivance I was glad to help such of my old friends as had the spirit to make the attempt to free themselves and I made more than one trip about this time to Maryland and Kentucky with the expectation in which I was not disappointed that some might be enabled to follow in my footsteps I knew the route pretty well and had much greater facilities for travelling than when I came out of that Egypt for the first time I did not find that our prosperity increased with our numbers The mere delight the slave took in his freedom rendered him at first contented with a lot far inferior to that which he might have attained Then his ignorance led him to make unprofitable bargains and he would often hire wild land on short terms and bind himself to clear a certain number of acres and by the time they were cleared and fitted for cultivation his lease was out and his landlord would come in and raise a splendid crop on the new land and the tenant would very likely start again on just such another bargain and be no better off at the end of ten years than he was at the beginning Another way in which they lost the profits of their labor was by raising nothing but tobacco the high price of which was very tempting and the cultivation of which was a monopoly in their hands as no white man understood it or could compete with them at all The consequence was however that they had nothing but tobacco to sell there was rather too much of it in the market and the price of wheat rose while their commodity was depressed and they lost all they should have saved in the profit they gave the trader for his corn and stores I saw the effect of these things so clearly that I could not help trying to make my friends and neighbors see it too and I set seriously about the business of lecturing upon the subject of crops wages and profits as if I had been brought up to it I insisted on the necessity of their raising their own crops saving their own wages and securing the profits of their own labor with such plain arguments as occurred to me and were as clear to their comprehension as to mine I did this very openly and frequently my audience consisted in part of the very traders whose inordinate profits upon individuals I was trying to diminish but whose balance of profit would not be ultimately lessened because they would have so many more persons to trade with who would be able to pay them a reasonable advance in cash or its equivalent on all their purchases The purse is a tender part of the system but I handled it so gently that the sensible portion of my natural opponents were not I believe offended while those whom I wished to benefit saw for the most part the propriety of my advice and took it At least there are now great numbers of settlers in this region of Canada who own their farms and are training up their children in true independence and giving them a good elementary education who had not taken a single step towards such a result before I began to talk to them I said none of the respectable traders were offended with me but one man had the folly to arrest me for a small debt under the pretence that I was about to leave the country when I was only about to Detroit for a few days in the spring leaving my crops on the ground and all my family at home but one little girl who was to go to school for a few weeks It was so absurd however that I was soon released by some of my friends of whom I had many among the whites as well as the blacks While I remained at Colchester I became acquainted with a Congregational missionary from Massachusetts by the name of Hiram Wilson who took an interest in our people and was disposed to do what he could to promote the cause of improvement which I had so much at heart He co perated with me in many efforts and I have been associated with him from to the present time He has been a faithful friend and still continues his important labors of love in our behalf Among other things which he did for as then he wrote to a Quaker friend of his an Englishman by the name of James C Fuller residing at Skeneateles New York and endeavored to interest him in the welfare of our struggling population He succeeded so far that Mr Fuller who was going on a visit to England promised to do what he could among his friends there to induce them to aid us He came back with fifteen hundred dollars which had been subscribed for our benefit It was a great question how this sum which sounded vast to many of my brethren should be appropriated I had my own opinion pretty decidedly made up as to what it was best for us all to do with it But in order to come to a satisfactory conclusion the first thing to be done was to call a convention of delegates from every settlement of blacks that was within reach that all might see that whatever was decided on was sanctioned by the disinterested votes of those who were thought by their companions best able to judge what was expedient Mr Wilson and myself called such a convention therefore to meet in London Upper Canada and it was held in June I urged the appropriation of the money to the establishment of a manual labor school where our children could be taught those elements of knowledge which are usually the occupations of a grammar school and where the boys could be taught in addition the practice of some mechanic art and the girls could be instructed in those domestic arts which are the proper occupation and ornament of their sex Such an establishment would train up those who would afterwards instruct others and we should thus gradually become independent of the white man for our intellectual progress as we might be also for our physical prosperity It was the more necessary as in many districts owing to the insurmountable prejudices of the inhabitants the children of the blacks were not allowed to share the advantages of the common school There was some opposition to this plan in the convention but in the course of the discussion which continued for three days it appeared so obviously for the advantage of all to husband this donation so as to preserve it for a purpose of permanent utility that the proposal was at last unanimously adopted and a committee of three was appointed to select and purchase a site for the establishment Mr Wilson and myself were the active members of this committee and after traversing the country for several months we could find no place more suitable than that upon which I had had my eye for three or four years for a permanent settlement in the town of Dawn We therefore bought two hundred acres of fine rich land on the river Sydenham covered with a heavy growth of black walnut and white wood at four dollars the acre I had made a bargain for two hundred acres adjoining this lot on my own account and circumstances favored me so that the man of whom I purchased was glad to let me have them at a large discount from the price I had agreed to pay if I would give him cash for the balance I owed him I transferred a portion of the advantage of this bargain to the institution by selling to it one hundred acres more at the low price at which I obtained them and thus the school has three hundred acres of as fine land and as well situated land as Canada can show at a very moderate cost In I removed with my family to Dawn and as a considerable number of my friends are there about me and the school is permanently fixed there the future importance of this settlement seems to be decided There are many other settlements which are considerable and indeed the colored population is scattered over a territory which does not fall far short of three hundred miles in extent in each direction and probably numbers not less than twenty thousand persons in all We look to the school and the possession of landed property by individuals as two great means of the elevation of our oppressed and degraded race to a participation in the blessings as they have hitherto been permitted to share only the miseries and vices of civilization My efforts to aid them in every way in my power and to procure the aid of others for them have been constant I have made many journeys into New York Connecticut Massachusetts and Maine in all of which States I have found or made some friends to the cause and I hope some personal friends I have received many liberal gifts and experienced much kindness of treatment but I must be allowed to allude particularly to the donations received from Boston by which we have been enabled to erect a sawmill and thus to begin in good earnest the clearing of our lands and to secure a profitable return for the support of our school as among those which have been most welcome and valuable to us I could give here a great many particulars which would amuse and interest the reader if they did not instruct him But it is better not to indulge the inclination and I will conclude my narrative by simply recording my gratitude heartfelt and inexpressible to God and to many of my fellow men for the vast improvement in my condition both physical and mental for the great degree of comfort with which I am surrounded for the good I have been enabled to effect for the light which has risen upon me for the religious privileges I enjoy and the religious hopes I am permitted to cherish for the prospects opening to my children so different from what they might have been and finally for the cheering expectation of benefiting not only the present but many future generations of my race
